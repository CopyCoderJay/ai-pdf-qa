But I warn you, if you don’t tell me that this means war, if\nyou still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that\nAntichrist—I really believe he is Antichrist—I will have nothing more to do\nwith you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my ‘faithful slave,’ as\nyou call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you—sit\ndown and tell me all the news.”\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pávlovna\nSchérer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. With\nthese words she greeted Prince Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high rank and\nimportance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pávlovna had\nhad a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe;\ngrippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by\na scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n“If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect\nof spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very\ncharmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10—Annette Schérer.”\n“Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in the least\ndisconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered\ncourt uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a\nserene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which\nour grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle,\npatronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in\nsociety and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna, kissed her hand,\npresenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently\nseated himself on the sofa.\n“First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend’s mind at\nrest,” said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected"}, {"page": 23, "text": "sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.\n“Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like\nthese if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You are staying the\nwhole evening, I hope?”\n“And the fete at the English ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must\nput in an appearance there,” said the prince. “My daughter is coming for me\nto take me there.”\n“I thought today’s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities\nand fireworks are becoming wearisome.”\n“If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have\nbeen put off,” said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit\nsaid things he did not even wish to be believed.\n“Don’t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosíltsev’s\ndispatch? You know everything.”\n“What can one say about it?” replied the prince in a cold, listless tone.\n“What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his\nboats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.”\nPrince Vasíli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part.\nAnna Pávlovna Schérer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed\nwith animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her\nsocial vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she\nbecame enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who\nknew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded\nfeatures, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a\ncontinual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished,\nnor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pávlovna burst\nout:\n“Oh, don’t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don’t understand things, but\nAustria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us!\nRussia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high\nvocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our\ngood and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and\nhe is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his\nvocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible"}, {"page": 24, "text": "than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge\nthe blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England\nwith her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor\nAlexander’s loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She\nwanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What\nanswer did Novosíltsev get? None. The English have not understood and\ncannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing\nfor himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they\npromised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not\nperform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that\nall Europe is powerless before him.... And I don’t believe a word that\nHardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just\na trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch.\nHe will save Europe!”\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\n“I think,” said the prince with a smile, “that if you had been sent instead\nof our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia’s\nconsent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?”\n“In a moment. À propos,” she added, becoming calm again, “I am\nexpecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who\nis connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best\nFrench families. He is one of the genuine émigrés, the good ones. And also\nthe Abbé Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received\nby the Emperor. Had you heard?”\n“I shall be delighted to meet them,” said the prince. “But tell me,” he\nadded with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him,\nthough the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit,\n“is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed\nfirst secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.”\nPrince Vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying\nthrough the Dowager Empress Márya Fëdorovna to secure it for the baron.\nAnna Pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor\nanyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased\nwith.\n“Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her\nsister,” was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone."}, {"page": 25, "text": "As she named the Empress, Anna Pávlovna’s face suddenly assumed an\nexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with\nsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\npatroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke\nbeaucoup d’estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\nThe prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and\ncourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pávlovna wished both\nto rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to\nthe Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said:\n“Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out\neveryone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.”\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\n“I often think,” she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the\nprince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social\ntopics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation—“I\noften think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why has\nfate given you two such splendid children? I don’t speak of Anatole, your\nyoungest. I don’t like him,” she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder\nand raising her eyebrows. “Two such charming children. And really you\nappreciate them less than anyone, and so you don’t deserve to have them.”\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n“I can’t help it,” said the prince. “Lavater would have said I lack the\nbump of paternity.”\n“Don’t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am\ndissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves” (and her face\nassumed its melancholy expression), “he was mentioned at Her Majesty’s\nand you were pitied....”\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,\nawaiting a reply. He frowned.\n“What would you have me do?” he said at last. “You know I did all a\nfather could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.\nHippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the\nonly difference between them.” He said this smiling in a way more natural\nand animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly\nrevealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant."}, {"page": 26, "text": "“And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father\nthere would be nothing I could reproach you with,” said Anna Pávlovna,\nlooking up pensively.\n“I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children\nare the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it\nto myself. It can’t be helped!”\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture.\nAnna Pávlovna meditated.\n“Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?” she\nasked. “They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I\ndon’t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very\nunhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary\nBolkónskaya.”\nPrince Vasíli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and\nperception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the\nhead that he was considering this information.\n“Do you know,” he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current\nof his thoughts, “that Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year?\nAnd,” he went on after a pause, “what will it be in five years, if he goes on\nlike this?” Presently he added: “That’s what we fathers have to put up\nwith.... Is this princess of yours rich?”\n“Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the well-\nknown Prince Bolkónski who had to retire from the army under the late\nEmperor, and was nicknamed ‘the King of Prussia.’ He is very clever but\neccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a brother; I\nthink you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp\nof Kutúzov’s and will be here tonight.”\n“Listen, dear Annette,” said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pávlovna’s\nhand and for some reason drawing it downwards. “Arrange that affair for\nme and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as a\nvillage elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good family\nand that’s all I want.”\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the\nmaid of honor’s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he lay\nback in his armchair, looking in another direction."}, {"page": 27, "text": "“Attendez,” said Anna Pávlovna, reflecting, “I’ll speak to Lise, young\nBolkónski’s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be arranged.\nIt shall be on your family’s behalf that I’ll start my apprenticeship as old\nmaid.”"}, {"page": 28, "text": "CHAPTER II\nAnna Pávlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest\nPetersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age and\ncharacter but alike in the social circle to which they belonged. Prince\nVasíli’s daughter, the beautiful Hélène, came to take her father to the\nambassador’s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of\nhonor. The youthful little Princess Bolkónskaya, known as la femme la plus\nséduisante de Pétersbourg, * was also there. She had been married during\nthe previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings,\nbut only to small receptions. Prince Vasíli’s son, Hippolyte, had come with\nMortemart, whom he introduced. The Abbé Morio and many others had\nalso come.\n* The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.\nTo each new arrival Anna Pávlovna said, “You have not yet seen my\naunt,” or “You do not know my aunt?” and very gravely conducted him or\nher to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had\ncome sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive;\nand slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pávlovna\nmentioned each one’s name and then left them.\nEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not\none of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them\ncared about; Anna Pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and\nsolemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in the\nsame words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty,\n“who, thank God, was better today.” And each visitor, though politeness\nprevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief\nat having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole\nevening."}, {"page": 29, "text": "The young Princess Bolkónskaya had brought some work in a gold-\nembroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark\ndown was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the\nmore sweetly, and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it\ndown to meet the lower lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly\nattractive woman, her defect—the shortness of her upper lip and her half-\nopen mouth—seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty.\nEveryone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to\nbecome a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so\nlightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after\nbeing in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too\nwere becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her, and at\neach word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth,\nthought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day.\nThe little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps,\nher workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a\nsofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to\nherself and to all around her. “I have brought my work,” said she in French,\ndisplaying her bag and addressing all present. “Mind, Annette, I hope you\nhave not played a wicked trick on me,” she added, turning to her hostess.\n“You wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just see how badly\nI am dressed.” And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-\ntrimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the\nbreast.\n“Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,”\nreplied Anna Pávlovna.\n“You know,” said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in\nFrench, turning to a general, “my husband is deserting me? He is going to\nget himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?” she added,\naddressing Prince Vasíli, and without waiting for an answer she turned to\nspeak to his daughter, the beautiful Hélène.\n“What a delightful woman this little princess is!” said Prince Vasíli to\nAnna Pávlovna.\nOne of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with close-\ncropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable at that time,\na very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout young man was an"}, {"page": 30, "text": "illegitimate son of Count Bezúkhov, a well-known grandee of Catherine’s\ntime who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man had not yet entered\neither the military or civil service, as he had only just returned from abroad\nwhere he had been educated, and this was his first appearance in society.\nAnna Pávlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest\nhierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a\nlook of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited\nto the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was\ncertainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could\nonly have reference to the clever though shy, but observant and natural,\nexpression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing\nroom.\n“It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor\ninvalid,” said Anna Pávlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt\nas she conducted him to her.\nPierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round\nas if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little\nprincess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.\nAnna Pávlovna’s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the\naunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty’s health. Anna\nPávlovna in dismay detained him with the words: “Do you know the Abbé\nMorio? He is a most interesting man.”\n“Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very\ninteresting but hardly feasible.”\n“You think so?” rejoined Anna Pávlovna in order to say something and\nget away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a\nreverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had finished\nspeaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who wished to\nget away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began\nexplaining his reasons for thinking the abbé’s plan chimerical.\n“We will talk of it later,” said Anna Pávlovna with a smile.\nAnd having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave,\nshe resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready\nto help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the\nforeman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round\nand notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes"}, {"page": 31, "text": "more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in\nproper motion, so Anna Pávlovna moved about her drawing room,\napproaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight\nrearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and\nregular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident.\nShe kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round\nMortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed\nto another group whose center was the abbé.\nPierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pávlovna’s\nwas the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual\nlights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did\nnot know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation that\nwas to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the\nfaces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very\nprofound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed\ninteresting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own\nviews, as young people are fond of doing."}, {"page": 32, "text": "CHAPTER III\nAnna Pávlovna’s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed\nsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt, beside\nwhom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather\nout of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had settled into\nthree groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abbé. Another,\nof young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess Hélène, Prince\nVasíli’s daughter, and the little Princess Bolkónskaya, very pretty and rosy,\nthough rather too plump for her age. The third group was gathered round\nMortemart and Anna Pávlovna.\nThe vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and\npolished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of\npoliteness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he\nfound himself. Anna Pávlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to\nher guests. As a clever maître d’hôtel serves up as a specially choice\ndelicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would\nhave cared to eat, so Anna Pávlovna served up to her guests, first the\nvicomte and then the abbé, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about\nMortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d’Enghien.\nThe vicomte said that the Duc d’Enghien had perished by his own\nmagnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte’s hatred\nof him.\n“Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,” said Anna Pávlovna, with a\npleasant feeling that there was something à la Louis XV in the sound of that\nsentence: “Contez nous çela, Vicomte.”\nThe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to\ncomply. Anna Pávlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to\nlisten to his tale."}, {"page": 33, "text": "“The vicomte knew the duc personally,” whispered Anna Pávlovna to one\nof the guests. “The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,” said she to another.\n“How evidently he belongs to the best society,” said she to a third; and the\nvicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most\nadvantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish.\nThe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.\n“Come over here, Hélène, dear,” said Anna Pávlovna to the beautiful\nyoung princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another group.\nThe princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with\nwhich she had first entered the room—the smile of a perfectly beautiful\nwoman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy,\nwith a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she\npassed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them\nbut smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring\nher beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom—which in the\nfashion of those days were very much exposed—and she seemed to bring\nthe glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pávlovna.\nHélène was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry,\nbut on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too\nvictorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its\neffect.\n“How lovely!” said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his\nshoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary\nwhen she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her\nunchanging smile.\n“Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,” said he,\nsmilingly inclining his head.\nThe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a\nreply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was being\ntold she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm, altered in\nshape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful bosom, on\nwhich she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she smoothed\nthe folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she\nglanced at Anna Pávlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on\nthe maid of honor’s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.\nThe little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hélène."}, {"page": 34, "text": "“Wait a moment, I’ll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking\nof?” she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. “Fetch me my workbag.”\nThere was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking\nmerrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat.\n“Now I am all right,” she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she took\nup her work.\nPrince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and\nmoving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.\nLe charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance\nto his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of this\nresemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his sister’s,\nbut while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-satisfied,\nyouthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wonderful classic\nbeauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a\nconstant expression of sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and\nweak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant,\nwearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.\n“It’s not going to be a ghost story?” said he, sitting down beside the\nprincess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this instrument he\ncould not begin to speak.\n“Why no, my dear fellow,” said the astonished narrator, shrugging his\nshoulders.\n“Because I hate ghost stories,” said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which\nshowed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had\nuttered them.\nHe spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure\nwhether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in a\ndark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe\neffrayée, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.\nThe vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current, to\nthe effect that the Duc d’Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit\nMademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also\nenjoyed the famous actress’ favors, and that in his presence Napoleon\nhappened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and"}, {"page": 35, "text": "was thus at the duc’s mercy. The latter spared him, and this magnanimity\nBonaparte subsequently repaid by death.\nThe story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where\nthe rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked agitated.\n“Charming!” said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the little\nprincess.\n“Charming!” whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her\nwork as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented\nher from going on with it.\nThe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared\nto continue, but just then Anna Pávlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on\nthe young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly\nand vehemently with the abbé, so she hurried to the rescue. Pierre had\nmanaged to start a conversation with the abbé about the balance of power,\nand the latter, evidently interested by the young man’s simple-minded\neagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were talking and listening\ntoo eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna Pávlovna disapproved.\n“The means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the\npeople,” the abbé was saying. “It is only necessary for one powerful nation\nlike Russia—barbaric as she is said to be—to place herself disinterestedly at\nthe head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance\nof power of Europe, and it would save the world!”\n“But how are you to get that balance?” Pierre was beginning.\nAt that moment Anna Pávlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,\nasked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian’s face instantly\nchanged and assumed an offensively affected, sugary expression, evidently\nhabitual to him when conversing with women.\n“I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society,\nmore especially of the feminine society, in which I have had the honor of\nbeing received, that I have not yet had time to think of the climate,” said he.\nNot letting the abbé and Pierre escape, Anna Pávlovna, the more\nconveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the larger\ncircle."}, {"page": 36, "text": "CHAPTER IV\nJust then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew\nBolkónski, the little princess’ husband. He was a very handsome young\nman, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about him,\nfrom his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a most\nstriking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was evident that he not only\nknew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome\nthat it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces\nthat he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his\npretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his\nhandsome face, kissed Anna Pávlovna’s hand, and screwing up his eyes\nscanned the whole company.\n“You are off to the war, Prince?” said Anna Pávlovna.\n“General Kutúzov,” said Bolkónski, speaking French and stressing the\nlast syllable of the general’s name like a Frenchman, “has been pleased to\ntake me as an aide-de-camp....”\n“And Lise, your wife?”\n“She will go to the country.”\n“Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?”\n“André,” said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish\nmanner in which she spoke to other men, “the vicomte has been telling us\nsuch a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!”\nPrince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from\nthe moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,\naffectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round\nPrince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was\ntouching his arm, but when he saw Pierre’s beaming face he gave him an\nunexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.\n“There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?” said he to Pierre."}, {"page": 37, "text": "“I knew you would be here,” replied Pierre. “I will come to supper with\nyou. May I?” he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who\nwas continuing his story.\n“No, impossible!” said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre’s\nhand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished to say\nsomething more, but at that moment Prince Vasíli and his daughter got up to\ngo and the two young men rose to let them pass.\n“You must excuse me, dear Vicomte,” said Prince Vasíli to the\nFrenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent\nhis rising. “This unfortunate fete at the ambassador’s deprives me of a\npleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave your\nenchanting party,” said he, turning to Anna Pávlovna.\nHis daughter, Princess Hélène, passed between the chairs, lightly holding\nup the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her\nbeautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes as\nshe passed him.\n“Very lovely,” said Prince Andrew.\n“Very,” said Pierre.\nIn passing Prince Vasíli seized Pierre’s hand and said to Anna Pávlovna:\n“Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and\nthis is the first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a\nyoung man as the society of clever women.”\nAnna Pávlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his\nfather to be a connection of Prince Vasíli’s. The elderly lady who had been\nsitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasíli in the\nanteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly\nand tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear.\n“How about my son Borís, Prince?” said she, hurrying after him into the\nanteroom. “I can’t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what news I\nmay take back to my poor boy.”\nAlthough Prince Vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the\nelderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an ingratiating\nand appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go away."}, {"page": 38, "text": "“What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would\nbe transferred to the Guards at once?” said she.\n“Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,” answered Prince\nVasíli, “but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should advise you to\nappeal to Rumyántsev through Prince Golítsyn. That would be the best\nway.”\nThe elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskáya, belonging to one of the\nbest families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of\nsociety had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to\nPetersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son. It was,\nin fact, solely to meet Prince Vasíli that she had obtained an invitation to\nAnna Pávlovna’s reception and had sat listening to the vicomte’s story.\nPrince Vasíli’s words frightened her, an embittered look clouded her once\nhandsome face, but only for a moment; then she smiled again and clutched\nPrince Vasíli’s arm more tightly.\n“Listen to me, Prince,” said she. “I have never yet asked you for anything\nand I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my father’s\nfriendship for you; but now I entreat you for God’s sake to do this for my\nson—and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,” she added hurriedly.\n“No, don’t be angry, but promise! I have asked Golítsyn and he has refused.\nBe the kindhearted man you always were,” she said, trying to smile though\ntears were in her eyes.\n“Papa, we shall be late,” said Princess Hélène, turning her beautiful head\nand looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by\nthe door.\nInfluence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if\nit is to last. Prince Vasíli knew this, and having once realized that if he\nasked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask\nfor himself, he became chary of using his influence. But in Princess\nDrubetskáya’s case he felt, after her second appeal, something like qualms\nof conscience. She had reminded him of what was quite true; he had been\nindebted to her father for the first steps in his career. Moreover, he could see\nby her manners that she was one of those women—mostly mothers—who,\nhaving once made up their minds, will not rest until they have gained their\nend, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour\nafter hour, and even to make scenes. This last consideration moved him."}, {"page": 39, "text": "“My dear Anna Mikháylovna,” said he with his usual familiarity and\nweariness of tone, “it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask; but to\nprove my devotion to you and how I respect your father’s memory, I will do\nthe impossible—your son shall be transferred to the Guards. Here is my\nhand on it. Are you satisfied?”\n“My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you—I knew your\nkindness!” He turned to go.\n“Wait—just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...” she\nfaltered. “You are on good terms with Michael Ilariónovich Kutúzov ...\nrecommend Borís to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and then...”\nPrince Vasíli smiled.\n“No, I won’t promise that. You don’t know how Kutúzov is pestered\nsince his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that all\nthe Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants.”\n“No, but do promise! I won’t let you go! My dear benefactor...”\n“Papa,” said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, “we shall\nbe late.”\n“Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?”\n“Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?”\n“Certainly; but about Kutúzov, I don’t promise.”\n“Do promise, do promise, Vasíli!” cried Anna Mikháylovna as he went,\nwith the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came\nnaturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.\nApparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all\nthe old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed\nits former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the group where the\nvicomte was still talking, and again pretended to listen, while waiting till it\nwould be time to leave. Her task was accomplished."}, {"page": 40, "text": "CHAPTER V\n“And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan?”\nasked Anna Pávlovna, “and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and\nLucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur\nBuonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations?\nAdorable! It is enough to make one’s head whirl! It is as if the whole world\nhad gone crazy.”\nPrince Andrew looked Anna Pávlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic\nsmile.\n“‘Dieu me la donne, gare à qui la touche!’’ * They say he was very fine\nwhen he said that,” he remarked, repeating the words in Italian: “‘Dio mi\nl’ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!’’\n* God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!\n“I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over,”\nAnna Pávlovna continued. “The sovereigns will not be able to endure this\nman who is a menace to everything.”\n“The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,” said the vicomte, polite but\nhopeless: “The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis XVII,\nfor the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!” and he became more\nanimated. “And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of\nthe Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors to\ncompliment the usurper.”\nAnd sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.\nPrince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time\nthrough his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the little\nprincess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condé coat of\narms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity as if she\nhad asked him to do it."}, {"page": 41, "text": "“Bâton de gueules, engrêlé de gueules d’azur—maison Condé,” said he.\nThe princess listened, smiling.\n“If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,” the\nvicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which he is\nbetter acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but follows the\ncurrent of his own thoughts, “things will have gone too far. By intrigues,\nviolence, exile, and executions, French society—I mean good French\nsociety—will have been forever destroyed, and then....”\nHe shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to\nmake a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pávlovna,\nwho had him under observation, interrupted:\n“The Emperor Alexander,” said she, with the melancholy which always\naccompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, “has declared that\nhe will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form of\ngovernment; and I believe that once free from the usurper, the whole nation\nwill certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king,” she concluded,\ntrying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant.\n“That is doubtful,” said Prince Andrew. “Monsieur le Vicomte quite\nrightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will be\ndifficult to return to the old regime.”\n“From what I have heard,” said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the\nconversation, “almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to\nBonaparte’s side.”\n“It is the Buonapartists who say that,” replied the vicomte without\nlooking at Pierre. “At the present time it is difficult to know the real state of\nFrench public opinion.”\n“Bonaparte has said so,” remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile.\nIt was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his\nremarks at him, though without looking at him.\n“‘I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,’” Prince\nAndrew continued after a short silence, again quoting Napoleon’s words.\n“‘I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.’ I do not know how far\nhe was justified in saying so.”\n“Not in the least,” replied the vicomte. “After the murder of the duc even\nthe most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some people,” he went"}, {"page": 42, "text": "on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, “he ever was a hero, after the murder of the\nduc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth.”\nBefore Anna Pávlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation\nof the vicomte’s epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and\nthough Anna Pávlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she\nwas unable to stop him.\n“The execution of the Duc d’Enghien,” declared Monsieur Pierre, “was a\npolitical necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of\nsoul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed.”\n“Dieu! Mon Dieu!” muttered Anna Pávlovna in a terrified whisper.\n“What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows\ngreatness of soul?” said the little princess, smiling and drawing her work\nnearer to her.\n“Oh! Oh!” exclaimed several voices.\n“Capital!” said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his knee\nwith the palm of his hand.\nThe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at\nhis audience over his spectacles and continued.\n“I say so,” he continued desperately, “because the Bourbons fled from the\nRevolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone understood\nthe Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good, he could not stop\nshort for the sake of one man’s life.”\n“Won’t you come over to the other table?” suggested Anna Pávlovna.\nBut Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.\n“No,” cried he, becoming more and more eager, “Napoleon is great\nbecause he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved\nall that was good in it—equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and\nof the press—and only for that reason did he obtain power.”\n“Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit\nmurder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have called him a\ngreat man,” remarked the vicomte.\n“He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might rid\nthem of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man. The\nRevolution was a grand thing!” continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by"}, {"page": 43, "text": "this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish\nto express all that was in his mind.\n“What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that... But\nwon’t you come to this other table?” repeated Anna Pávlovna.\n“Rousseau’s Contrat Social,” said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.\n“I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.”\n“Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,” again interjected an\nironical voice.\n“Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important.\nWhat is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices, and\nequality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full\nforce.”\n“Liberty and equality,” said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last\ndeciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were, “high-\nsounding words which have long been discredited. Who does not love\nliberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality. Have\npeople since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We wanted\nliberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.”\nPrince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the\nvicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of\nPierre’s outburst Anna Pávlovna, despite her social experience, was horror-\nstruck. But when she saw that Pierre’s sacrilegious words had not\nexasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was impossible\nto stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous\nattack on the orator.\n“But, my dear Monsieur Pierre,” said she, “how do you explain the fact\nof a great man executing a duc—or even an ordinary man who—is innocent\nand untried?”\n“I should like,” said the vicomte, “to ask how monsieur explains the 18th\nBrumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at all like\nthe conduct of a great man!”\n“And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!” said the little\nprincess, shrugging her shoulders.\n“He’s a low fellow, say what you will,” remarked Prince Hippolyte."}, {"page": 44, "text": "Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His\nsmile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled, his grave,\neven rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by another—a\nchildlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to ask forgiveness.\nThe vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this\nyoung Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were silent.\n“How do you expect him to answer you all at once?” said Prince Andrew.\n“Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his\nacts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor. So it seems to me.”\n“Yes, yes, of course!” Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of this\nreinforcement.\n“One must admit,” continued Prince Andrew, “that Napoleon as a man\nwas great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he gave\nhis hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts which it is\ndifficult to justify.”\nPrince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness\nof Pierre’s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go.\nSuddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend,\nand asking them all to be seated began:\n“I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it.\nExcuse me, Vicomte—I must tell it in Russian or the point will be lost....”\nAnd Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian as a\nFrenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia. Everyone\nwaited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his\nstory.\n“There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must\nhave two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her\ntaste. And she had a lady’s maid, also big. She said....”\nHere Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with\ndifficulty.\n“She said.... Oh yes! She said, ‘Girl,’ to the maid, ‘put on a livery, get up\nbehind the carriage, and come with me while I make some calls.’”\nHere Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his\naudience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator.

The girl lost her hat and her\nlong hair came down....” Here he could contain himself no longer and went\non, between gasps of laughter: “And the whole world knew....”\nAnd so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told\nit, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pávlovna and the others\nappreciated Prince Hippolyte’s social tact in so agreeably ending Pierre’s\nunpleasant and unamiable outburst.

Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge\nred hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing room\nand still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something particularly\nagreeable before going away. Besides this he was absent-minded. When he\nrose to go, he took up instead of his own, the general’s three-cornered hat,\nand held it, pulling at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All\nhis absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was,\nhowever, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna\nPávlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed\nforgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: “I hope to see you again,\nbut I also hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.”\nWhen she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again\neverybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, “Opinions are\nopinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.” And\neveryone, including Anna Pávlovna, felt this.\nPrince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders to\nthe footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened indifferently\nto his wife’s chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the hall.\nPrince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant princess, and stared\nfixedly at her through his eyeglass.\n“Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,” said the little princess, taking\nleave of Anna Pávlovna. “It is settled,” she added in a low voice.\nAnna Pávlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match\nshe contemplated between Anatole and the little princess’ sister-in-law.\n“I rely on you, my dear,” said Anna Pávlovna, also in a low tone. “Write\nto her and let me know how her father looks at the matter.

I don’t like either the one or the other.”\n“But you must decide on something!

If it were a war for freedom I\ncould understand it and should be the first to enter the army; but to help\nEngland and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right.”\nPrince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre’s childish words. He\nput on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense, but\nit would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one\nPrince Andrew gave to this naïve question.\n“If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no wars,”\nhe said.\n“And that would be splendid,” said Pierre.\nPrince Andrew smiled ironically.\n“Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....”\n“Well, why are you going to the war?” asked Pierre.\n“What for? I don’t know. I must. Besides that I am going....” He paused.\n“I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!”"}, {"page": 50, "text": "CHAPTER VII\nThe rustle of a woman’s dress was heard in the next room. Prince\nAndrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had\nhad in Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from the\nsofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as\nfresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a\nchair for her.\n“How is it,” she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and\nfussily in the easy chair, “how is it Annette never got married? How stupid\nyou men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying so, but you\nhave no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you are,\nMonsieur Pierre!”\n“And I am still arguing with your husband. I can’t understand why he\nwants to go to the war,” replied Pierre, addressing the princess with none of\nthe embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse\nwith young women.\nThe princess started. Evidently Pierre’s words touched her to the quick.\n“Ah, that is just what I tell him!” said she. “I don’t understand it; I don’t\nin the least understand why men can’t live without wars. How is it that we\nwomen don’t want anything of the kind, don’t need it? Now you shall judge\nbetween us. I always tell him: Here he is Uncle’s aide-de-camp, a most\nbrilliant position. He is so well known, so much appreciated by everyone.\nThe other day at the Apráksins’ I heard a lady asking, ‘Is that the famous\nPrince Andrew?’ I did indeed.” She laughed. “He is so well received\neverywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You\nknow the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were\nspeaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?”\nPierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the\nconversation, gave no reply."}, {"page": 51, "text": "“When are you starting?” he asked.\n“Oh, don’t speak of his going, don’t! I won’t hear it spoken of,” said the\nprincess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to\nHippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited to the\nfamily circle of which Pierre was almost a member. “Today when I\nremembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off ... and\nthen you know, André...” (she looked significantly at her husband) “I’m\nafraid, I’m afraid!” she whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.\nHer husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides\nPierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of frigid\npoliteness.\n“What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don’t understand,” said he.\n“There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim of his\nown, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone in the\ncountry.”\n“With my father and sister, remember,” said Prince Andrew gently.\n“Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to be\nafraid.”\nHer tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a\njoyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she felt it\nindecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the\nmatter lay in that.\n“I still can’t understand what you are afraid of,” said Prince Andrew\nslowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.\nThe princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.\n“No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....”\n“Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,” said Prince Andrew. “You\nhad better go.”\nThe princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered.\nPrince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.\nPierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise, now at him and\nnow at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.\n“Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?” exclaimed the little\nprincess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace."}, {"page": 52, "text": "“I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me?\nWhat have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity for me.\nWhy is it?”\n“Lise!” was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an\nentreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself regret her\nwords. But she went on hurriedly:\n“You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave like\nthat six months ago?”\n“Lise, I beg you to desist,” said Prince Andrew still more emphatically.\nPierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to\nall this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the\nsight of tears and was ready to cry himself.\n“Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you I\nmyself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me! An\noutsider is out of place here.... No, don’t distress yourself.... Good-by!”\nPrince Andrew caught him by the hand.\n“No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the\npleasure of spending the evening with you.”\n“No, he thinks only of himself,” muttered the princess without restraining\nher angry tears.\n“Lise!” said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which\nindicates that patience is exhausted.\nSuddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess’ pretty face\nchanged into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes glanced\naskance at her husband’s face, and her own assumed the timid, deprecating\nexpression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail.\n“Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!” she muttered, and lifting her dress with one\nhand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.\n“Good night, Lise,” said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as he\nwould have done to a stranger."}, {"page": 53, "text": "CHAPTER VIII\nThe friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre continually\nglanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his\nsmall hand.\n“Let us go and have supper,” he said with a sigh, going to the door.\nThey entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.\nEverything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore that\nimprint of newness found in the households of the newly married. Halfway\nthrough supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and, with a\nlook of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face,\nbegan to talk—as one who has long had something on his mind and\nsuddenly determines to speak out.\n“Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That’s my advice: never marry till\nyou can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and until\nyou have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her\nplainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake.\nMarry when you are old and good for nothing—or all that is good and noble\nin you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don’t look\nat me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anything from yourself in\nthe future, you will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed\nexcept the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with a\ncourt lackey and an idiot!... But what’s the good?...” and he waved his arm.\nPierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the\ngood-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in\namazement.\n“My wife,” continued Prince Andrew, “is an excellent woman, one of\nthose rare women with whom a man’s honor is safe; but, O God, what\nwould I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to\nwhom I mention this, because I like you.”"}, {"page": 54, "text": "As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkónski who\nhad lolled in Anna Pávlovna’s easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had\nuttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face was\nnow quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the fire of life\nhad seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. It was evident\nthat the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more impassioned he\nbecame in these moments of almost morbid irritation.\n“You don’t understand why I say this,” he continued, “but it is the whole\nstory of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,” said he (though Pierre\nhad not mentioned Bonaparte), “but Bonaparte when he worked went step\nby step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing but his aim to\nconsider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a\nchained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you have of hope and\nstrength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret. Drawing\nrooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality—these are the enchanted circle I\ncannot escape from. I am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever\nwas, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have\na caustic wit,” continued Prince Andrew, “and at Anna Pávlovna’s they\nlisten to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and\nthose women.... If you only knew what those society women are, and\nwomen in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in\neverything—that’s what women are when you see them in their true colors!\nWhen you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them,\nbut there’s nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don’t marry, my dear fellow;\ndon’t marry!” concluded Prince Andrew.\n“It seems funny to me,” said Pierre, “that you, you should consider\nyourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have everything before\nyou, everything. And you....”\nHe did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he\nthought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.\n“How can he talk like that?” thought Pierre. He considered his friend a\nmodel of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree\njust the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best described as\nstrength of will. Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrew’s calm\nmanner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensive\nreading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about"}, {"page": 55, "text": "everything), but above all at his capacity for work and study. And if Pierre\nwas often struck by Andrew’s lack of capacity for philosophical meditation\n(to which he himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as\na defect but as a sign of strength.\nEven in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and\ncommendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that they\nmay run smoothly.\n“My part is played out,” said Prince Andrew. “What’s the use of talking\nabout me? Let us talk about you,” he added after a silence, smiling at his\nreassuring thoughts.\nThat smile was immediately reflected on Pierre’s face.\n“But what is there to say about me?” said Pierre, his face relaxing into a\ncareless, merry smile. “What am I? An illegitimate son!” He suddenly\nblushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this.\n“Without a name and without means... And it really...” But he did not say\nwhat “it really” was. “For the present I am free and am all right. Only I\nhaven’t the least idea what I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.”\nPrince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance—friendly and\naffectionate as it was—expressed a sense of his own superiority.\n“I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our\nwhole set. Yes, you’re all right! Choose what you will; it’s all the same.\nYou’ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting those Kurágins\nand leading that sort of life. It suits you so badly—all this debauchery,\ndissipation, and the rest of it!”\n“What would you have, my dear fellow?” answered Pierre, shrugging his\nshoulders. “Women, my dear fellow; women!”\n“I don’t understand it,” replied Prince Andrew. “Women who are comme\nil faut, that’s a different matter; but the Kurágins’ set of women, ‘women\nand wine’ I don’t understand!”\nPierre was staying at Prince Vasíli Kurágin’s and sharing the dissipated\nlife of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to reform by\nmarrying him to Prince Andrew’s sister.\n“Do you know?” said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought,\n“seriously, I have long been thinking of it....

It was a cloudless,\nnorthern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight\nhome. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility\nof going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to see a long way in\nthe deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night.\nOn the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kurágin was expecting the\nusual set for cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking\nbout, finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.\n“I should like to go to Kurágin’s,” thought he.\nBut he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go\nthere. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so\npassionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to\nthat he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his\npromise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he\nhad already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; “besides,”\nthought he, “all such ‘words of honor’ are conventional things with no\ndefinite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be\ndead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and\ndishonor will be all the same!” Pierre often indulged in reflections of this\nsort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to Kurágin’s.\nReaching the large house near the Horse Guards’ barracks, in which\nAnatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs, and\nwent in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty bottles,\ncloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of alcohol, and\nsounds of voices and shouting in the distance.\nCards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed. Pierre\nthrew off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the remains of\nsupper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on the sly what"}, {"page": 58, "text": "was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of laughter, the\nshouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and general commotion.\nSome eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open\nwindow. Three others were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by\nthe chain and trying to set him at the others.\n“I bet a hundred on Stevens!” shouted one.\n“Mind, no holding on!” cried another.\n“I bet on Dólokhov!” cried a third. “Kurágin, you part our hands.”\n“There, leave Bruin alone; here’s a bet on.”\n“At one draught, or he loses!” shouted a fourth.\n“Jacob, bring a bottle!” shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow who\nstood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine linen shirt\nunfastened in front. “Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here is Pétya! Good man!”\ncried he, addressing Pierre.\nAnother voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,\nparticularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring, cried\nfrom the window: “Come here; part the bets!” This was Dólokhov, an\nofficer of the Semënov regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who was\nliving with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily.\n“I don’t understand. What’s it all about?”\n“Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,” said Anatole, and taking a\nglass from the table he went up to Pierre.\n“First of all you must drink!”\nPierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the\ntipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening to\ntheir chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre’s glass while explaining that\nDólokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval officer, that he would\ndrink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window\nwith his legs hanging out.\n“Go on, you must drink it all,” said Anatole, giving Pierre the last glass,\n“or I won’t let you go!”\n“No, I won’t,” said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the\nwindow."}, {"page": 59, "text": "Dólokhov was holding the Englishman’s hand and clearly and distinctly\nrepeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to Anatole\nand Pierre.\nDólokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He\nwas about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so\nthat his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen. The\nlines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle of the upper\nlip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and\nsomething like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners\nof the mouth; this, together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his\neyes, produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face.\nDólokhov was a man of small means and no connections. Yet, though\nAnatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dólokhov lived with him and had\nplaced himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including Anatole\nhimself, respected him more than they did Anatole. Dólokhov could play all\ngames and nearly always won. However much he drank, he never lost his\nclearheadedness. Both Kurágin and Dólokhov were at that time notorious\namong the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.\nThe bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented\nanyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen,\nwho were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of\nthe gentlemen around.\nAnatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to\nsmash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but\ncould not move it. He smashed a pane.\n“You have a try, Hercules,” said he, turning to Pierre.\nPierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out\nwith a crash.\n“Take it right out, or they’ll think I’m holding on,” said Dólokhov.\n“Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?” said Anatole.\n“First-rate,” said Pierre, looking at Dólokhov, who with a bottle of rum in\nhis hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky, the\ndawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.\nDólokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window\nsill. “Listen!” cried he, standing there and addressing those in the room.

Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum\nwithout taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this spot”\n(he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window) “and\nwithout holding on to anything. Is that right?”\n“Quite right,” said the Englishman.\nAnatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of\nhis coat and looking down at him—the Englishman was short—began\nrepeating the terms of the wager to him in English.\n“Wait!” cried Dólokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill to\nattract attention. “Wait a bit, Kurágin. Listen! If anyone else does the same,\nI will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?”\nThe Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to\naccept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though he\nkept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating\nDólokhov’s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life\nGuards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill,\nleaned over, and looked down.\n“Oh! Oh! Oh!” he muttered, looking down from the window at the stones\nof the pavement.\n“Shut up!” cried Dólokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad\njumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.\nPlacing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily,\nDólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered\nhis legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on\nhis seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to the left,\nand took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the\nwindow sill, though it was already quite light. Dólokhov’s back in his white\nshirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to\nthe window, the Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One"}, {"page": 61, "text": "man, older than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared\nand angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dólokhov’s shirt.\n“I say, this is folly! He’ll be killed,” said this more sensible man.\nAnatole stopped him.\n“Don’t touch him! You’ll startle him and then he’ll be killed. Eh?... What\nthen?... Eh?”\nDólokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged\nhimself on his seat.\n“If anyone comes meddling again,” said he, emitting the words\nseparately through his thin compressed lips, “I will throw him down there.\nNow then!”\nSaying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and\nlifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to balance\nhimself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass\nremained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from\nDólokhov’s back. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman\nlooked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop\nthe affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his\nface to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade\nthough his features now expressed horror and fear. All were still. Pierre\ntook his hands from his eyes. Dólokhov still sat in the same position, only\nhis head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar,\nand the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled\nwith the effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher\nand his head tilting yet further back. “Why is it so long?” thought Pierre. It\nseemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dólokhov\nmade a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled\nnervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on\nthe sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered\nstill more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill,\nbut refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he\nwould never open them again. Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around.\nHe looked up: Dólokhov was standing on the window sill, with a pale but\nradiant face.\n“It’s empty.”"}, {"page": 62, "text": "He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly.

The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception\nmade, and Borís transferred into the regiment of Semënov Guards with the\nrank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment to Kutúzov’s staff\ndespite all Anna Mikháylovna’s endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna\nPávlovna’s reception Anna Mikháylovna returned to Moscow and went\nstraight to her rich relations, the Rostóvs, with whom she stayed when in\nthe town and where her darling Bóry, who had only just entered a regiment\nof the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had\nbeen educated from childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had\nalready left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had\nremained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to\nRadzivílov.\nIt was St. Natalia’s day and the name day of two of the Rostóvs—the\nmother and the youngest daughter—both named Nataly. Ever since the\nmorning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually,\nbringing visitors to the Countess Rostóva’s big house on the Povarskáya, so\nwell known to all Moscow. The countess herself and her handsome eldest\ndaughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to\ncongratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in relays.\nThe countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type\nof face, evidently worn out with childbearing—she had had twelve. A\nlanguor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a\ndistinguished air which inspired respect.

As soon as he had seen a visitor off he\nreturned to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair\ntoward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands\non his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live,\nhe swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or\ntouched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in\nvery bad but self-confident French; then again, like a man weary but\nunflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and,\nstroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner.\nSometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the\nconservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables were\nbeing set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who were\nbringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table\nlinen, he would call Dmítri Vasílevich, a man of good family and the\nmanager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous\ntable would say: “Well, Dmítri, you’ll see that things are all as they should\nbe?

I was so delighted...” came\nthe sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting one another and\nmingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs. Then one of\nthose conversations began which last out until, at the first pause, the guests\nrise with a rustle of dresses and say, “I am so delighted... Mamma’s health...\nand Countess Apráksina...” and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom,\nput on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief\ntopic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of\nCatherine’s day, Count Bezúkhov, and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the\none who had behaved so improperly at Anna Pávlovna’s reception.\n“I am so sorry for the poor count,” said the visitor. “He is in such bad\nhealth, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him!”\n“What is that?” asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor\nalluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of Count\nBezúkhov’s distress some fifteen times.\n“That’s what comes of a modern education,” exclaimed the visitor. “It\nseems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he\nliked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that\nhe has been expelled by the police.”\n“You don’t say so!” replied the countess.\n“He chose his friends badly,” interposed Anna Mikháylovna. “Prince\nVasíli’s son, he, and a certain Dólokhov have, it is said, been up to heaven\nonly knows what! And they have had to suffer for it. Dólokhov has been\ndegraded to the ranks and Bezúkhov’s son sent back to Moscow. Anatole\nKurágin’s father managed somehow to get his son’s affair hushed up, but\neven he was ordered out of Petersburg.”\n“But what have they been up to?” asked the countess.\n“They are regular brigands, especially Dólokhov,” replied the visitor. “He\nis a son of Márya Ivánovna Dólokhova, such a worthy woman, but there,\njust fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage,\nand set off with it to visit some actresses! The police tried to interfere, and\nwhat did the young men do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to"}, {"page": 66, "text": "back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear\nswimming about with the policeman on his back!”\n“What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!” shouted the\ncount, dying with laughter.\n“Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?”\nYet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.\n“It was all they could do to rescue the poor man,” continued the visitor.\n“And to think it is Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov’s son who amuses\nhimself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well educated and\nclever. This is all that his foreign education has done for him! I hope that\nhere in Moscow no one will receive him, in spite of his money. They\nwanted to introduce him to me, but I quite declined: I have my daughters to\nconsider.”\n“Why do you say this young man is so rich?” asked the countess, turning\naway from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention. “His\nchildren are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is illegitimate.”\nThe visitor made a gesture with her hand.\n“I should think he has a score of them.”\nPrincess Anna Mikháylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently\nwishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society.\n“The fact of the matter is,” said she significantly, and also in a half\nwhisper, “everyone knows Count Cyril’s reputation.... He has lost count of\nhis children, but this Pierre was his favorite.”\n“How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!” remarked the\ncountess. “I have never seen a handsomer man.”\n“He is very much altered now,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “Well, as I was\nsaying, Prince Vasíli is the next heir through his wife, but the count is very\nfond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor about\nhim; so that in the case of his death—and he is so ill that he may die at any\nmoment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from Petersburg—no one knows who\nwill inherit his immense fortune, Pierre or Prince Vasíli. Forty thousand\nserfs and millions of rubles! I know it all very well for Prince Vasíli told me\nhimself. Besides, Cyril Vladímirovich is my mother’s second cousin. He’s\nalso my Bóry’s godfather,” she added, as if she attached no importance at\nall to the fact."}, {"page": 67, "text": "“Prince Vasíli arrived in Moscow yesterday.

The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably, but\nnot concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and\ntook their leave. The visitor’s daughter was already smoothing down her\ndress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the next\nroom were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the\nnoise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the\nfolds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of\nthe room. It was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so\nfar. Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat\ncollar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy\nin a short jacket.\nThe count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms\nwide and threw them round the little girl who had run in.\n“Ah, here she is!” he exclaimed laughing. “My pet, whose name day it is.\nMy dear pet!”\n“Ma chère, there is a time for everything,” said the countess with feigned\nseverity. “You spoil her, Ilyá,” she added, turning to her husband.\n“How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name\nday,” said the visitor. “What a charming child,” she added, addressing the\nmother.\nThis black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life—with\nchildish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice,\nwith black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled\ndrawers, and feet in low slippers—was just at that charming age when a girl\nis no longer a child, though the child is not yet a young woman. Escaping\nfrom her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother’s\nmantilla—not paying the least attention to her severe remark—and began to"}, {"page": 69, "text": "laugh. She laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a\ndoll which she produced from the folds of her frock.\n“Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...” was all Natásha managed to\nutter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against her mother and\nburst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could\nnot help joining in.\n“Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,” said the\nmother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to\nthe visitor she added: “She is my youngest girl.”\nNatásha, raising her face for a moment from her mother’s mantilla,\nglanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.\nThe visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it\nnecessary to take some part in it.\n“Tell me, my dear,” said she to Natásha, “is Mimi a relation of yours? A\ndaughter, I suppose?”\nNatásha did not like the visitor’s tone of condescension to childish things.\nShe did not reply, but looked at her seriously.\nMeanwhile \nthe \nyounger \ngeneration: \nBorís, \nthe \nofficer, Anna\nMikháylovna’s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count’s eldest son;\nSónya, the count’s fifteen-year-old niece, and little Pétya, his youngest boy,\nhad all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to\nrestrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone\nin all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms, from which they had dashed\nout so impetuously, the conversation had been more amusing than the\ndrawing room talk of society scandals, the weather, and Countess\nApráksina. Now and then they glanced at one another, hardly able to\nsuppress their laughter.\nThe two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood,\nwere of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. Borís\nwas tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate\nfeatures. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression. Dark\nhairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face expressed\nimpetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing\nroom. He evidently tried to find something to say, but failed. Borís on the\ncontrary at once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously how"}, {"page": 70, "text": "he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before\nher nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years he had known\nher, and how her head had cracked right across the skull.

She turned away from him and glanced at her\nyounger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with\nsuppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she jumped\nup and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry\nher. Borís did not laugh.\n“You were meaning to go out, weren’t you, Mamma? Do you want the\ncarriage?” he asked his mother with a smile.\n“Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,” she answered, returning his\nsmile.\nBorís quietly left the room and went in search of Natásha. The plump boy\nran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been disturbed."}, {"page": 71, "text": "CHAPTER XII\nThe only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the\nyoung lady visitor and the countess’ eldest daughter (who was four years\nolder than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person), were\nNicholas and Sónya, the niece. Sónya was a slender little brunette with a\ntender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits\ncoiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and\nespecially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and\nneck. By the grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility of her\nsmall limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded\none of a pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful\nlittle cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the\ngeneral conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their\nthick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with\nsuch passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant\nimpose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only\nto spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as\nthey too could, like Natásha and Borís, escape from the drawing room.\n“Ah yes, my dear,” said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing to\nNicholas, “his friend Borís has become an officer, and so for friendship’s\nsake he is leaving the university and me, his old father, and entering the\nmilitary service, my dear. And there was a place and everything waiting for\nhim in the Archives Department! Isn’t that friendship?” remarked the count\nin an inquiring tone.\n“But they say that war has been declared,” replied the visitor.\n“They’ve been saying so a long while,” said the count, “and they’ll say\nso again and again, and that will be the end of it. My dear, there’s friendship\nfor you,” he repeated. “He’s joining the hussars.”\nThe visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head."}, {"page": 72, "text": "“It’s not at all from friendship,” declared Nicholas, flaring up and turning\naway as if from a shameful aspersion. “It is not from friendship at all; I\nsimply feel that the army is my vocation.”\nHe glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both\nregarding him with a smile of approbation.\n“Schubert, the colonel of the Pávlograd Hussars, is dining with us today.\nHe has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him. It can’t be\nhelped!” said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a\nmatter that evidently distressed him.\n“I have already told you, Papa,” said his son, “that if you don’t wish to let\nme go, I’ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except in the army; I am\nnot a diplomat or a government clerk.—I don’t know how to hide what I\nfeel.” As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome\nyouth at Sónya and the young lady visitor.\nThe little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment\nto start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.\n“All right, all right!” said the old count. “He always flares up! This\nBuonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he rose from an\nensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,” he added, not\nnoticing his visitor’s sarcastic smile.\nThe elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Karágina turned to\nyoung Rostóv.\n“What a pity you weren’t at the Arkhárovs’ on Thursday. It was so dull\nwithout you,” said she, giving him a tender smile.\nThe young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile,\nand engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation without at all\nnoticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of Sónya, who\nblushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk he glanced round at\nher. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to restrain\nher tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the\nroom. All Nicholas’ animation vanished. He waited for the first pause in the\nconversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find Sónya.\n“How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves!”\nsaid Anna Mikháylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out. “Cousinage—\ndangereux voisinage,” * she added."}, {"page": 73, "text": "* Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.\n“Yes,” said the countess when the brightness these young people had\nbrought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no one\nhad put but which was always in her mind, “and how much suffering, how\nmuch anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now!\nAnd yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is always,\nalways anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both for girls and\nboys.”\n“It all depends on the bringing up,” remarked the visitor.\n“Yes, you’re quite right,” continued the countess. “Till now I have\nalways, thank God, been my children’s friend and had their full\nconfidence,” said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who\nimagine that their children have no secrets from them. “I know I shall\nalways be my daughters’ first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his\nimpulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can’t help it), he will all the\nsame never be like those Petersburg young men.”\n“Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,” chimed in the count, who\nalways solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that\neverything was splendid. “Just fancy: wants to be an hussar. What’s one to\ndo, my dear?”\n“What a charming creature your younger girl is,” said the visitor; “a little\nvolcano!”\n“Yes, a regular volcano,” said the count. “Takes after me! And what a\nvoice she has; though she’s my daughter, I tell the truth when I say she’ll be\na singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an Italian to give her\nlessons.”\n“Isn’t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that\nage.”\n“Oh no, not at all too young!” replied the count. “Why, our mothers used\nto be married at twelve or thirteen.”\n“And she’s in love with Borís already. Just fancy!” said the countess with\na gentle smile, looking at Borís and went on, evidently concerned with a\nthought that always occupied her: “Now you see if I were to be severe with\nher and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly”\n(she meant that they would be kissing), “but as it is, I know every word she"}, {"page": 74, "text": "utters. She will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and\ntell me everything. Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan.\nWith her elder sister I was stricter.”\n“Yes, I was brought up quite differently,” remarked the handsome elder\ndaughter, Countess Véra, with a smile.\nBut the smile did not enhance Véra’s beauty as smiles generally do; on\nthe contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, expression.\nVéra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well\nbrought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was true and\nappropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone—the visitors and countess alike—\nturned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it, and they all felt\nawkward.\n“People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make\nsomething exceptional of them,” said the visitor.\n“What’s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too\nclever with Véra,” said the count. “Well, what of that? She’s turned out\nsplendidly all the same,” he added, winking at Véra.\nThe guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.\n“What manners! I thought they would never go,” said the countess, when\nshe had seen her guests out."}, {"page": 75, "text": "CHAPTER XIII\nWhen Natásha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the\nconservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation in\nthe drawing room, waiting for Borís to come out. She was already growing\nimpatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming at once,\nwhen she heard the young man’s discreet steps approaching neither quickly\nnor slowly. At this Natásha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid\nthere.\nBorís paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little\ndust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined his\nhandsome face. Natásha, very still, peered out from her ambush, waiting to\nsee what he would do. He stood a little while before the glass, smiled, and\nwalked toward the other door. Natásha was about to call him but changed\nher mind. “Let him look for me,” thought she. Hardly had Borís gone than\nSónya, flushed, in tears, and muttering angrily, came in at the other door.\nNatásha checked her first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her\nhiding place, watching—as under an invisible cap—to see what went on in\nthe world. She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. Sónya,\nmuttering to herself, kept looking round toward the drawing room door. It\nopened and Nicholas came in.\n“Sónya, what is the matter with you? How can you?” said he, running up\nto her.\n“It’s nothing, nothing; leave me alone!” sobbed Sónya.\n“Ah, I know what it is.”\n“Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!”\n“Só-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that,\nfor a mere fancy?” said Nicholas taking her hand.\nSónya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Natásha, not stirring and\nscarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes. “What"}, {"page": 76, "text": "will happen now?” thought she.\n“Sónya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are everything!”\nsaid Nicholas. “And I will prove it to you.”\n“I don’t like you to talk like that.”\n“Well, then, I won’t; only forgive me, Sónya!” He drew her to him and\nkissed her.\n“Oh, how nice,” thought Natásha; and when Sónya and Nicholas had\ngone out of the conservatory she followed and called Borís to her.\n“Borís, come here,” said she with a sly and significant look. “I have\nsomething to tell you. Here, here!” and she led him into the conservatory to\nthe place among the tubs where she had been hiding.\nBorís followed her, smiling.\n“What is the something?” asked he.\nShe grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown\ndown on one of the tubs, picked it up.\n“Kiss the doll,” said she.\nBorís looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not reply.\n“Don’t you want to? Well, then, come here,” said she, and went further in\namong the plants and threw down the doll. “Closer, closer!” she whispered.\nShe caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and\nfear appeared on her flushed face.\n“And me? Would you like to kiss me?” she whispered almost inaudibly,\nglancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from\nexcitement.\nBorís blushed.\n“How funny you are!” he said, bending down to her and blushing still\nmore, but he waited and did nothing.\nSuddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him\nso that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing\nback her hair, kissed him full on the lips.\nThen she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the\ntubs and stood, hanging her head.\n“Natásha,” he said, “you know that I love you, but....”"}, {"page": 77, "text": "“You are in love with me?” Natásha broke in.\n“Yes, I am, but please don’t let us do like that....

Then it’s settled?”\nA smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.\n“Settled!” replied Borís.\n“Forever?” said the little girl. “Till death itself?”\nShe took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining\nsitting room."}, {"page": 78, "text": "CHAPTER XIV\nAfter receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave orders\nto admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all\nwho came “to congratulate.” The countess wished to have a tête-à-tête talk\nwith the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna Mikháylovna, whom she\nhad not seen properly since she returned from Petersburg. Anna\nMikháylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face, drew her chair nearer to\nthat of the countess.\n“With you I will be quite frank,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “There are not\nmany left of us old friends! That’s why I so value your friendship.”\nAnna Mikháylovna looked at Véra and paused. The countess pressed her\nfriend’s hand.\n“Véra,” she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite,\n“how is it you have so little tact? Don’t you see you are not wanted here?\nGo to the other girls, or...”\nThe handsome Véra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.\n“If you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,” she replied as\nshe rose to go to her own room.\nBut as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting, one\npair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. Sónya was sitting\nclose to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the first he had\never written. Borís and Natásha were at the other window and ceased\ntalking when Véra entered. Sónya and Natásha looked at Véra with guilty,\nhappy faces.\nIt was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but\napparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Véra.\n“How often have I asked you not to take my things?” she said. “You have\na room of your own,” and she took the inkstand from Nicholas."}, {"page": 79, "text": "“In a minute, in a minute,” he said, dipping his pen.\n“You always manage to do things at the wrong time,” continued Véra.\n“You came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of\nyou.”\nThough what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one\nreplied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the room\nwith the inkstand in her hand.\n“And at your age what secrets can there be between Natásha and Borís,\nor between you two? It’s all nonsense!”\n“Now, Véra, what does it matter to you?” said Natásha in defense,\nspeaking very gently.\nShe seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to\neveryone.\n“Very silly,” said Véra. “I am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!”\n“All have secrets of their own,” answered Natásha, getting warmer. “We\ndon’t interfere with you and Berg.”\n“I should think not,” said Véra, “because there can never be anything\nwrong in my behavior. But I’ll just tell Mamma how you are behaving with\nBorís.”\n“Natálya Ilyníchna behaves very well to me,” remarked Borís. “I have\nnothing to complain of.”\n“Don’t, Borís! You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome,” said\nNatásha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly. (She used the word\n“diplomat,” which was just then much in vogue among the children, in the\nspecial sense they attached to it.) “Why does she bother me?” And she\nadded, turning to Véra, “You’ll never understand it, because you’ve never\nloved anyone. You have no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing\nmore” (this nickname, bestowed on Véra by Nicholas, was considered very\nstinging), “and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and\nflirt with Berg as much as you please,” she finished quickly.\n“I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors...”\n“Well, now you’ve done what you wanted,” put in Nicholas—“said\nunpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let’s go to the nursery.”\nAll four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room."}, {"page": 80, "text": "“The unpleasant things were said to me,” remarked Véra, “I said none to\nanyone.”\n“Madame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!” shouted laughing voices\nthrough the door.\nThe handsome Véra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant\neffect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been said\nto her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf. Looking at\nher own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer.\nIn the drawing room the conversation was still going on.\n“Ah, my dear,” said the countess, “my life is not all roses either. Don’t I\nknow that at the rate we are living our means won’t last long? It’s all the\nClub and his easygoing nature. Even in the country do we get any rest?\nTheatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what besides! But don’t let’s talk\nabout me; tell me how you managed everything. I often wonder at you,\nAnnette—how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow,\nto Petersburg, to those ministers and great people, and know how to deal\nwith them all! It’s quite astonishing. How did you get things settled? I\ncouldn’t possibly do it.”\n“Ah, my love,” answered Anna Mikháylovna, “God grant you never\nknow what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to\ndistraction! One learns many things then,” she added with a certain pride.\n“That lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those big people I\nwrite a note: ‘Princess So-and-So desires an interview with So and-So,’ and\nthen I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four times—till I get what I\nwant. I don’t mind what they think of me.”\n“Well, and to whom did you apply about Bóry?” asked the countess.\n“You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas is\ngoing as a cadet. There’s no one to interest himself for him. To whom did\nyou apply?”\n“To Prince Vasíli. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything, and\nput the matter before the Emperor,” said Princess Anna Mikháylovna\nenthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain\nher end."}, {"page": 81, "text": "“Has Prince Vasíli aged much?” asked the countess. “I have not seen him\nsince we acted together at the Rumyántsovs’ theatricals.

His position has not turned his head at all. He said to me, ‘I\nam sorry I can do so little for you, dear Princess. I am at your command.’\nYes, he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my\nlove for my son: I would do anything for his happiness! And my affairs are\nin such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one,” continued Anna\nMikháylovna, sadly, dropping her voice. “My wretched lawsuit takes all I\nhave and makes no progress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a\npenny and don’t know how to equip Borís.” She took out her handkerchief\nand began to cry. “I need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-\nfive-ruble note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril\nVladímirovich Bezúkhov. If he will not assist his godson—you know he is\nBóry’s godfather—and allow him something for his maintenance, all my\ntrouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be able to equip him.”\nThe countess’ eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.\n“I often think, though, perhaps it’s a sin,” said the princess, “that here\nlives Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bezúkhov so rich, all alone... that\ntremendous fortune... and what is his life worth?

The story told about him at Count Rostóv’s was true. Pierre had\ntaken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been for some days in\nMoscow and was staying as usual at his father’s house. Though he expected\nthat the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that\nthe ladies about his father—who were never favorably disposed toward him\n—would have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the\nday of his arrival went to his father’s part of the house. Entering the\ndrawing room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the\nladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read\naloud. It was the eldest who was reading—the one who had met Anna\nMikháylovna. The two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy\nand pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip\nwhich made her much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or\na leper. The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him\nwith frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression;\nwhile the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and lively\ndisposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the\namusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the canvas\nand, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying to make out\nthe pattern.\n“How do you do, cousin?” said Pierre. “You don’t recognize me?”\n“I recognize you only too well, too well.”\n“How is the count? Can I see him?” asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual,\nbut unabashed.\n“The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have\ndone your best to increase his mental sufferings.”"}, {"page": 89, "text": "“Can I see the count?” Pierre again asked.\n“Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see him...\nOlga, go and see whether Uncle’s beef tea is ready—it is almost time,” she\nadded, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and busy making his\nfather comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only busy causing him\nannoyance.\nOlga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and\nsaid: “Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see\nhim.”\nAnd he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the\nsister with the mole.\nNext day Prince Vasíli had arrived and settled in the count’s house. He\nsent for Pierre and said to him: “My dear fellow, if you are going to behave\nhere as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that is all I have to\nsay to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must not see him at all.”\nSince then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in\nhis rooms upstairs.\nWhen Borís appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his\nroom, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the\nwall, as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely\nover his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering indistinct\nwords, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.\n“England is done for,” said he, scowling and pointing his finger at\nsomeone unseen. “Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of\nman, is sentenced to...” But before Pierre—who at that moment imagined\nhimself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous\ncrossing of the Straits of Dover and captured London—could pronounce\nPitt’s sentence, he saw a well-built and handsome young officer entering his\nroom. Pierre paused. He had left Moscow when Borís was a boy of\nfourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual impulsive and hearty\nway he took Borís by the hand with a friendly smile.\n“Do you remember me?” asked Borís quietly with a pleasant smile. “I\nhave come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not well.”\n“Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,” answered\nPierre, trying to remember who this young man was."}, {"page": 90, "text": "Borís felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it\nnecessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least\nembarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.\n“Count Rostóv asks you to come to dinner today,” said he, after a\nconsiderable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.\n“Ah, Count Rostóv!” exclaimed Pierre joyfully. “Then you are his son,\nIlyá? Only fancy, I didn’t know you at first. Do you remember how we went\nto the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It’s such an age...”\n“You are mistaken,” said Borís deliberately, with a bold and slightly\nsarcastic smile. “I am Borís, son of Princess Anna Mikháylovna\nDrubetskáya. Rostóv, the father, is Ilyá, and his son is Nicholas. I never\nknew any Madame Jacquot.”\nPierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.\n“Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I’ve mixed everything up. One has\nso many relatives in Moscow! So you are Borís? Of course. Well, now we\nknow where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition?\nThe English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the\nChannel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve doesn’t\nmake a mess of things!”\nBorís knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the\npapers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve’s name.\n“We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal\nthan with politics,” said he in his quiet ironical tone. “I know nothing about\nit and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy with gossip,” he\ncontinued. “Just now they are talking about you and your father.”\nPierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion’s\nsake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret. But\nBorís spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into Pierre’s eyes.\n“Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,” Borís went on. “Everybody\nis wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune, though he may\nperhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...”\n“Yes, it is all very horrid,” interrupted Pierre, “very horrid.”\nPierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something\ndisconcerting to himself."}, {"page": 91, "text": "“And it must seem to you,” said Borís flushing slightly, but not changing\nhis tone or attitude, “it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get\nsomething out of the rich man?”\n“So it does,” thought Pierre.\n“But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are quite\nmistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are very\npoor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that your father is\nrich, I don’t regard myself as a relation of his, and neither I nor my mother\nwould ever ask or take anything from him.”\nFor a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped\nup from the sofa, seized Borís under the elbow in his quick, clumsy way,\nand, blushing far more than Borís, began to speak with a feeling of mingled\nshame and vexation.\n“Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know\nvery well...”\nBut Borís again interrupted him.\n“I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You must\nexcuse me,” said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by\nhim, “but I hope I have not offended you. I always make it a rule to speak\nout... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to dinner at the\nRostóvs’?”\nAnd Borís, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and\nextricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,\nbecame quite pleasant again.\n“No, but I say,” said Pierre, calming down, “you are a wonderful fellow!\nWhat you have just said is good, very good. Of course you don’t know me.\nWe have not met for such a long time... not since we were children. You\nmight think that I... I understand, quite understand. I could not have done it\nmyself, I should not have had the courage, but it’s splendid. I am very glad\nto have made your acquaintance. It’s queer,” he added after a pause, “that\nyou should have suspected me!” He began to laugh. “Well, what of it! I\nhope we’ll get better acquainted,” and he pressed Borís’ hand. “Do you\nknow, I have not once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I\nam sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?”"}, {"page": 92, "text": "“And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?” asked\nBorís with a smile.\nPierre saw that Borís wished to change the subject, and being of the same\nmind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the\nBoulogne expedition.\nA footman came in to summon Borís—the princess was going. Pierre, in\norder to make Borís’ better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner, and\nwarmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into\nBorís’ eyes.

He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,\nhaving stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the\nsmoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor,\nShinshín, a cousin of the countess’, a man with “a sharp tongue” as they\nsaid in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to his companion.\nThe latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed,\nbrushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with\nred lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome\nmouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Semënov"}, {"page": 97, "text": "regiment with whom Borís was to travel to join the army, and about whom\nNatásha had teased her elder sister Véra, speaking of Berg as her\n“intended.” The count sat between them and listened attentively. His\nfavorite occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very fond\nof, was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two\nloquacious talkers at one another.\n“Well, then, old chap, mon très honorable Alphonse Kárlovich,” said\nShinshín, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian\nexpressions with the choicest French phrases—which was a peculiarity of\nhis speech. “Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l’état; * you want to\nmake something out of your company?”\n* You expect to make an income out of the government.\n“No, Peter Nikoláevich; I only want to show that in the cavalry the\nadvantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own position\nnow, Peter Nikoláevich...”\nBerg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His\nconversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm and\nsilent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on\nhimself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of\ncountenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as soon as the\nconversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and\nwith evident satisfaction.\n“Consider my position, Peter Nikoláevich. Were I in the cavalry I should\nget not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even with the rank\nof lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and thirty,” said he, looking\nat Shinshín and the count with a joyful, pleasant smile, as if it were obvious\nto him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone else.\n“Besides that, Peter Nikoláevich, by exchanging into the Guards I shall\nbe in a more prominent position,” continued Berg, “and vacancies occur\nmuch more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think what can be done\nwith two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a little aside and\nto send something to my father,” he went on, emitting a smoke ring.\n“La balance y est... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the proverb\nsays,” remarked Shinshín, moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth\nand winking at the count."}, {"page": 98, "text": "* So that squares matters.\nThe count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that Shinshín was\ntalking came up to listen.

Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all\nthis, and did not seem to suspect that others, too, might have their own\ninterests. But all he said was so prettily sedate, and the naïveté of his\nyouthful egotism was so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers.\n“Well, my boy, you’ll get along wherever you go—foot or horse—that\nI’ll warrant,” said Shinshín, patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet\noff the sofa.\nBerg smiled joyously. The count, followed by his guests, went into the\ndrawing room.\nIt was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests,\nexpecting the summons to zakúska, * avoid engaging in any long\nconversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order to show\nthat they are not at all impatient for their food.

The countess tried to make him talk, but he went on\nnaïvely looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody\nand answered all her questions in monosyllables. He was in the way and\nwas the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of the guests, knowing\nof the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man,\nwondering how such a clumsy, modest fellow could have played such a\nprank on a policeman.\n“You have only lately arrived?” the countess asked him.\n“Oui, madame,” replied he, looking around him."}, {"page": 99, "text": "“You have not yet seen my husband?”\n“Non, madame.” He smiled quite inappropriately.\n“You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it’s very\ninteresting.”\n“Very interesting.”\nThe countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikháylovna. The latter\nunderstood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and sitting\ndown beside him she began to speak about his father; but he answered her,\nas he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other guests were all\nconversing with one another. “The Razumóvskis... It was charming... You\nare very kind... Countess Apráksina...” was heard on all sides. The countess\nrose and went into the ballroom.\n“Márya Dmítrievna?” came her voice from there.\n“Herself,” came the answer in a rough voice, and Márya Dmítrievna\nentered the room.\nAll the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest\nrose. Márya Dmítrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout, holding high her\nfifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood surveying the guests, and\nleisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up. Márya Dmítrievna\nalways spoke in Russian.\n“Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her\nchildren,” she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all others.\n“Well, you old sinner,” she went on, turning to the count who was kissing\nher hand, “you’re feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay? Nowhere to hunt with\nyour dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just see how these nestlings\nare growing up,” and she pointed to the girls. “You must look for husbands\nfor them whether you like it or not....”\n“Well,” said she, “how’s my Cossack?” (Márya Dmítrievna always called\nNatásha a Cossack) and she stroked the child’s arm as she came up fearless\nand gay to kiss her hand. “I know she’s a scamp of a girl, but I like her.”\nShe took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and,\nhaving given them to the rosy Natásha, who beamed with the pleasure of\nher saint’s-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to Pierre.\n“Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,” said she, assuming a soft high tone of\nvoice. “Come here, my friend...” and she ominously tucked up her sleeves"}, {"page": 100, "text": "still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a childlike way through his\nspectacles.\n“Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell your\nfather the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it’s my evident\nduty.” She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to follow, for this\nwas clearly only a prelude.\n“A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed and he\namuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame, sir, for\nshame! It would be better if you went to the war.”\nShe turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep\nfrom laughing.\n“Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?” said Márya Dmítrievna.\nThe count went in first with Márya Dmítrievna, the countess followed on\nthe arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because\nNicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikháylovna\nwith Shinshín. Berg gave his arm to Véra. The smiling Julie Karágina went\nin with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the whole\ndining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses followed\nsingly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the band struck up\nin the gallery, and the guests settled down in their places. Then the strains of\nthe count’s household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks,\nthe voices of visitors, and the soft steps of the footmen. At one end of the\ntable sat the countess with Márya Dmítrievna on her right and Anna\nMikháylovna on her left, the other lady visitors were farther down. At the\nother end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshín and\nthe other male visitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side\nsat the grown-up young people: Véra beside Berg, and Pierre beside Borís;\nand on the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind the\ncrystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his wife and her\ntall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors’ glasses,\nnot neglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting her duties as\nhostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her\nhusband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more\nthan usual with his gray hair. At the ladies’ end an even chatter of voices\nwas heard all the time, at the men’s end the voices sounded louder and\nlouder, especially that of the colonel of hussars who, growing more and"}, {"page": 101, "text": "more flushed, ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern\nto the other guests. Berg with tender smiles was saying to Véra that love is\nnot an earthly but a heavenly feeling. Borís was telling his new friend Pierre\nwho the guests were and exchanging glances with Natásha, who was sitting\nopposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a great\ndeal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the\ngame without omitting a single dish or one of the wines. These latter the\nbutler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behind the\nnext man’s shoulders and whispered: “Dry Madeira”... “Hungarian”... or\n“Rhine wine” as the case might be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved\nwith the count’s monogram that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one\nat random and drank with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing\namiability at the other guests. Natásha, who sat opposite, was looking at\nBorís as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just\nkissed for the first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that\nfunny lively little girl’s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing\nwhy.\nNicholas sat at some distance from Sónya, beside Julie Karágina, to\nwhom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. Sónya wore a\ncompany smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned\npale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and\nJulie were saying to one another. The governess kept looking round\nuneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the\nchildren. The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines,\nand kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner to his\npeople in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a\nbottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to appear as\nif he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because no one would\nunderstand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he\nwanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge."}, {"page": 102, "text": "CHAPTER XIX\nAt the men’s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated. The\ncolonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in\nPetersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been\nforwarded by courier to the commander in chief.\n“And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?” remarked\nShinshín. “He has stopped Austria’s cackle and I fear it will be our turn\nnext.”\nThe colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to the\nservice and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinshín’s remark.\n“It is for the reasson, my goot sir,” said he, speaking with a German\naccent, “for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He declares in ze\nmanifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening Russia\nand zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell as ze sanctity of its\nalliances...” he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay\nthe gist of the matter.\nThen with the unerring official memory that characterized him he\nrepeated from the opening words of the manifesto:\n... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor’s sole and absolute aim—\nto establish peace in Europe on firm foundations—has now decided him to\ndespatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the\nattainment of that purpose.\n“Zat, my dear sir, is vy...” he concluded, drinking a tumbler of wine with\ndignity and looking to the count for approval.\n“Connaissez-vous le Proverbe:* ‘Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but turn\nspindles at home!’?” said Shinshín, puckering his brows and smiling. “Cela\nnous convient à merveille.*(2) Suvórov now—he knew what he was about;\nyet they beat him à plate couture,*(3) and where are we to find Suvórovs"}, {"page": 103, "text": "now?

And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible”... he dwelt particularly\non the word possible... “as po-o-ossible,” he ended, again turning to the\ncount. “Zat is how ve old hussars look at it, and zere’s an end of it! And\nhow do you, a young man and a young hussar, how do you judge of it?” he\nadded, addressing Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being\ndiscussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the\ncolonel.\n“I am quite of your opinion,” replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning his\nplate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and\ndesperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger. “I\nam convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,” he concluded,\nconscious—as were others—after the words were uttered that his remarks\nwere too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore\nawkward.\n“What you said just now was splendid!” said his partner Julie.\nSónya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and\ndown to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.\nPierre listened to the colonel’s speech and nodded approvingly.\n“That’s fine,” said he.\n“The young man’s a real hussar!” shouted the colonel, again thumping\nthe table.\n“What are you making such a noise about over there?” Márya\nDmítrievna’s deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table.\n“What are you thumping the table for?” she demanded of the hussar, “and\nwhy are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French are here?”"}, {"page": 104, "text": "“I am speaking ze truce,” replied the hussar with a smile.\n“It’s all about the war,” the count shouted down the table. “You know my\nson’s going, Márya Dmítrievna? My son is going.”\n“I have four sons in the army but still I don’t fret. It is all in God’s hands.\nYou may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle,” replied Márya\nDmítrievna’s deep voice, which easily carried the whole length of the table.\n“That’s true!”\nOnce more the conversations concentrated, the ladies’ at the one end and\nthe men’s at the other.\n“You won’t ask,” Natásha’s little brother was saying; “I know you won’t\nask!”\n“I will,” replied Natásha.\nHer face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half\nrose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what was\ncoming, and turning to her mother:\n“Mamma!” rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice,\naudible the whole length of the table.\n“What is it?” asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her daughter’s\nface that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her sternly with a\nthreatening and forbidding movement of her head.\nThe conversation was hushed.\n“Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” and Natásha’s voice\nsounded still more firm and resolute.\nThe countess tried to frown, but could not. Márya Dmítrievna shook her\nfat finger.\n“Cossack!” she said threateningly.\nMost of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the\nelders.\n“You had better take care!” said the countess.\n“Mamma! What sweets are we going to have?” Natásha again cried\nboldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in good\npart.\nSónya and fat little Pétya doubled up with laughter."}, {"page": 105, "text": "“You see! I have asked,” whispered Natásha to her little brother and to\nPierre, glancing at him again.\n“Ice pudding, but you won’t get any,” said Márya Dmítrievna.\nNatásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even\nMárya Dmítrievna.\n“Márya Dmítrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don’t like ice cream.”\n“Carrot ices.”\n“No! What kind, Márya Dmítrievna? What kind?” she almost screamed;\n“I want to know!”\nMárya Dmítrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the guests\njoined in. Everyone laughed, not at Márya Dmítrievna’s answer but at the\nincredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat\nMárya Dmítrievna in this fashion.\nNatásha only desisted when she had been told that there would be\npineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band\nagain struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving their\nseats, went up to “congratulate” the countess, and reached across the table\nto clink glasses with the count, with the children, and with one another.\nAgain the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the same order in\nwhich they had entered but with redder faces, the guests returned to the\ndrawing room and to the count’s study."}, {"page": 106, "text": "CHAPTER XX\nThe card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the count’s\nvisitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms, some in the\nsitting room, some in the library.\nThe count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from\ndropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything. The\nyoung people, at the countess’ instigation, gathered round the clavichord\nand harp. Julie by general request played first. After she had played a little\nair with variations on the harp, she joined the other young ladies in begging\nNatásha and Nicholas, who were noted for their musical talent, to sing\nsomething. Natásha, who was treated as though she were grown up, was\nevidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy.\n“What shall we sing?” she said.\n“‘The Brook,’” suggested Nicholas.\n“Well, then, let’s be quick. Borís, come here,” said Natásha. “But where\nis Sónya?”\nShe looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to\nlook for her.\nRunning into Sónya’s room and not finding her there, Natásha ran to the\nnursery, but Sónya was not there either. Natásha concluded that she must be\non the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage was the place of\nmourning for the younger female generation in the Rostóv household. And\nthere in fact was Sónya lying face downward on Nurse’s dirty feather bed\non the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her, hiding\nher face with her slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsively that her bare\nlittle shoulders shook. Natásha’s face, which had been so radiantly happy all\nthat saint’s day, suddenly changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver\npassed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped."}, {"page": 107, "text": "“Sónya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!” And\nNatásha’s large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she began\nto wail like a baby without knowing why, except that Sónya was crying.\nSónya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and hid her face still\ndeeper in the bed. Natásha wept, sitting on the blue-striped feather bed and\nhugging her friend. With an effort Sónya sat up and began wiping her eyes\nand explaining.\n“Nicholas is going away in a week’s time, his... papers... have come... he\ntold me himself... but still I should not cry,” and she showed a paper she\nheld in her hand—with the verses Nicholas had written, “still, I should not\ncry, but you can’t... no one can understand... what a soul he has!”\nAnd she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.\n“It’s all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and Borís\nalso,” she went on, gaining a little strength; “he is nice... there are no\ndifficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin... one would have to...\nthe Metropolitan himself... and even then it can’t be done. And besides, if\nshe tells Mamma” (Sónya looked upon the countess as her mother and\ncalled her so) “that I am spoiling Nicholas’ career and am heartless and\nungrateful, while truly... God is my witness,” and she made the sign of the\ncross, “I love her so much, and all of you, only Véra... And what for? What\nhave I done to her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice\neverything, only I have nothing....”\nSónya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in the\nfeather bed. Natásha began consoling her, but her face showed that she\nunderstood all the gravity of her friend’s trouble.\n“Sónya,” she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true reason\nof her friend’s sorrow, “I’m sure Véra has said something to you since\ndinner? Hasn’t she?”\n“Yes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others, and\nshe found them on my table and said she’d show them to Mamma, and that\nI was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry me, but\nthat he’ll marry Julie. You see how he’s been with her all day... Natásha,\nwhat have I done to deserve it?...”\nAnd again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Natásha lifted her\nup, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting her."}, {"page": 108, "text": "“Sónya, don’t believe her, darling! Don’t believe her!

And\nwe are only second cousins, you know. And Borís says it is quite possible.\nYou know I have told him all about it. And he is so clever and so good!”\nsaid Natásha. “Don’t you cry, Sónya, dear love, darling Sónya!” and she\nkissed her and laughed. “Véra’s spiteful; never mind her! And all will come\nright and she won’t say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself,\nand he doesn’t care at all for Julie.”\nNatásha kissed her on the hair.\nSónya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed\nready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin playing with the\nball of worsted as a kitten should.\n“Do you think so?... Really? Truly?” she said, quickly smoothing her\nfrock and hair.\n“Really, truly!” answered Natásha, pushing in a crisp lock that had\nstrayed from under her friend’s plaits.\nBoth laughed.\n“Well, let’s go and sing ‘The Brook.’”\n“Come along!”\n“Do you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!” said\nNatásha, stopping suddenly. “I feel so happy!”\nAnd she set off at a run along the passage.\nSónya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the\nverses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran after\nNatásha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light,\njoyous steps. At the visitors’ request the young people sang the quartette,\n“The Brook,” with which everyone was delighted. Then Nicholas sang a\nsong he had just learned:\nAt nighttime in the moon’s fair glow\n    How sweet, as fancies wander free,\nTo feel that in this world there’s one\n    Who still is thinking but of thee!"}, {"page": 109, "text": "That while her fingers touch the harp\n    Wafting sweet music o’er the lea,\nIt is for thee thus swells her heart,\n    Sighing its message out to thee...\nA day or two, then bliss unspoilt,\n    But oh! till then I cannot live!...\nHe had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get\nready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the coughing\nof the musicians were heard from the gallery.\nPierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinshín had engaged him,\nas a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in which\nseveral others joined but which bored Pierre.

Natásha was perfectly happy; she\nwas dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She was sitting in\na conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady. She had a fan\nin her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold. Assuming quite the\npose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where she had learned\nit) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and smiling over the fan.\n“Dear, dear! Just look at her!” exclaimed the countess as she crossed the\nballroom, pointing to Natásha.\nNatásha blushed and laughed.\n“Well, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised\nat?”\nIn the midst of the third écossaise there was a clatter of chairs being\npushed back in the sitting room where the count and Márya Dmítrievna had\nbeen playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older\nvisitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long, and replacing"}, {"page": 110, "text": "their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First came Márya\nDmítrievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The count, with\nplayful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to Márya\nDmítrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his\nface and as soon as the last figure of the écossaise was ended, he clapped\nhis hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing the\nfirst violin:\n“Semën! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?”\nThis was the count’s favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth.\n(Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)\n“Look at Papa!” shouted Natásha to the whole company, and quite\nforgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her curly\nhead to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.\nAnd indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the\njovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner, Márya\nDmítrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his shoulders, turned\nout his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by a smile that broadened his\nround face more and more, prepared the onlookers for what was to follow.\nAs soon as the provocatively gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat\nresembling those of a merry peasant dance) began to sound, all the\ndoorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs—the\nmen on one side and the women on the other—who with beaming faces had\ncome to see their master making merry.\n“Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!” loudly remarked the\nnurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.\nThe count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not\nwant to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms\nhanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her\nstern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed by\nthe whole of the count’s plump figure, in Márya Dmítrievna found\nexpression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose.\nBut if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed the\nspectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility\nwith which he capered about on his light feet, Márya Dmítrievna produced\nno less impression by slight exertions—the least effort to move her\nshoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her foot—which"}, {"page": 111, "text": "everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity. The dance\ngrew livelier and livelier. The other couples could not attract a moment’s\nattention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so. All were\nwatching the count and Márya Dmítrievna. Natásha kept pulling everyone\nby sleeve or dress, urging them to “look at Papa!” though as it was they\nnever took their eyes off the couple. In the intervals of the dance the count,\nbreathing deeply, waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster,\nfaster, and faster; lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the\ncount, flying round Márya Dmítrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels;\nuntil, turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising\nhis soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a\nwide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by\nNatásha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily and wiping their faces\nwith their cambric handkerchiefs.\n“That’s how we used to dance in our time, ma chère,” said the count.\n“That was a Daniel Cooper!” exclaimed Márya Dmítrievna, tucking up\nher sleeves and puffing heavily."}, {"page": 112, "text": "CHAPTER XXI\nWhile in the Rostóvs’ ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced, to a\ntune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired footmen and\ncooks were getting the supper, Count Bezúkhov had a sixth stroke.

After a mute confession,\ncommunion was administered to the dying man, preparations made for the\nsacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of\nsuspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond the gates, a\ngroup of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up, waited in\nexpectation of an important order for an expensive funeral. The Military\nGovernor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to\ninquire after the count’s health, came himself that evening to bid a last\nfarewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherine’s court, Count Bezúkhov.\nThe magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up\nrespectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an hour\nalone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their bows\nand trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by\nthe doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince Vasíli, who had\ngrown thinner and paler during the last few days, escorted him to the door,\nrepeating something to him several times in low tones.\nWhen the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vasíli sat down all alone\non a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other, leaning his\nelbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand.

Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons\nwith a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and\ndevotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince Vasíli\nunderstood it as an expression of weariness.\n“And I?” he said; “do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn out as a\npost horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a very serious\ntalk.”\nPrince Vasíli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously, now\non one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression\nwhich was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes too seemed\nstrange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced\nround in alarm.\nThe princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands,\nlooked attentively into Prince Vasíli’s eyes evidently resolved not to be the\nfirst to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.\n“Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Semënovna,”\ncontinued Prince Vasíli, returning to his theme, apparently not without an\ninner struggle; “at such a moment as this one must think of everything. One\nmust think of the future, of all of you... I love you all, like children of my\nown, as you know.”\nThe princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same\ndull expression.\n“And then of course my family has also to be considered,” Prince Vasíli\nwent on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at her. “You\nknow, Catiche, that we—you three sisters, Mámontov, and my wife—are\nthe count’s only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it is for you to talk or\nthink of such matters. It is no easier for me; but, my dear, I am getting on\nfor sixty and must be prepared for anything. Do you know I have sent for\nPierre? The count,” pointing to his portrait, “definitely demanded that he\nshould be called.”\nPrince Vasíli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make out\nwhether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was\nsimply looking at him."}, {"page": 116, "text": "“There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,” she\nreplied, “and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his\nnoble soul peacefully to leave this...”\n“Yes, yes, of course,” interrupted Prince Vasíli impatiently, rubbing his\nbald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had\npushed away. “But... in short, the fact is... you know yourself that last\nwinter the count made a will by which he left all his property, not to us his\ndirect heirs, but to Pierre.”\n“He has made wills enough!” quietly remarked the princess. “But he\ncannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.”\n“But, my dear,” said Prince Vasíli suddenly, clutching the little table and\nbecoming more animated and talking more rapidly: “what if a letter has\nbeen written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre’s\nlegitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the count’s\nservices, his request would be granted?...”\nThe princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the\nsubject under discussion than those they are talking with.\n“I can tell you more,” continued Prince Vasíli, seizing her hand, “that\nletter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew of it. The\nonly question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then as soon as all is\nover,” and Prince Vasíli sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all\nis over, “and the count’s papers are opened, the will and letter will be\ndelivered to the Emperor, and the petition will certainly be granted.

He will then be the legal\nheir to everything and you won’t get anything. You must know, my dear,\nwhether the will and letter were written, and whether they have been\ndestroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you ought to\nknow where they are, and must find them, because...”\n“What next?” the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not\nchanging the expression of her eyes. “I am a woman, and you think we are\nall stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit... un bâtard!”*"}, {"page": 117, "text": "she added, as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively\nprove to Prince Vasíli the invalidity of his contention.\n* A bastard.\n“Well, really, Catiche!

As the wheels rolled softly over\nthe straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikháylovna, having turned with\nwords of comfort to her companion, realized that he was asleep in his\ncorner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna\nMikháylovna out of the carriage, and only then began to think of the\ninterview with his dying father which awaited him. He noticed that they had\nnot come to the front entrance but to the back door. While he was getting\ndown from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran\nhurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a\nmoment, Pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the\nshadow of the house on both sides. But neither Anna Mikháylovna nor the\nfootman nor the coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took\nany notice of them. “It seems to be all right,” Pierre concluded, and\nfollowed Anna Mikháylovna. She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit\nstone staircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow.\nThough he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at\nall, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna\nMikháylovna’s air of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all\nabsolutely necessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over\nby some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots\nclattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna\nMikháylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there.\n“Is this the way to the princesses’ apartments?” asked Anna Mikháylovna\nof one of them.\n“Yes,” replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were now\npermissible; “the door to the left, ma’am.”"}, {"page": 121, "text": "“Perhaps the count did not ask for me,” said Pierre when he reached the\nlanding. “I’d better go to my own room.”\nAnna Mikháylovna paused and waited for him to come up.\n“Ah, my friend!” she said, touching his arm as she had done her son’s\nwhen speaking to him that afternoon, “believe me I suffer no less than you\ndo, but be a man!”\n“But really, hadn’t I better go away?” he asked, looking kindly at her\nover his spectacles.\n“Ah, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you.\nThink that he is your father ... perhaps in the agony of death.” She sighed.\n“I have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to me, Pierre. I\nshall not forget your interests.”\nPierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had to be\ngrew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikháylovna who was already\nopening a door.\nThis door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the\nprincesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been in this\npart of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms.\nAnna Mikháylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a\ndecanter on a tray as “my dear” and “my sweet,” asked about the princess’\nhealth and then led Pierre along a stone passage. The first door on the left\nled into the princesses’ apartments. The maid with the decanter in her haste\nhad not closed the door (everything in the house was done in haste at that\ntime), and Pierre and Anna Mikháylovna in passing instinctively glanced\ninto the room, where Prince Vasíli and the eldest princess were sitting close\ntogether talking. Seeing them pass, Prince Vasíli drew back with obvious\nimpatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation\nslammed the door with all her might.\nThis action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on\nPrince Vasíli’s face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre stopped\nand glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna Mikháylovna\nevinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as if to say that this\nwas no more than she had expected.\n“Be a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,” said she in reply\nto his look, and went still faster along the passage."}, {"page": 122, "text": "Pierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what\n“watching over his interests” meant, but he decided that all these things had\nto be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit room adjoining the\ncount’s reception room. It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments\nknown to Pierre only from the front approach, but even in this room there\nnow stood an empty bath, and water had been spilled on the carpet. They\nwere met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on\ntiptoe without heeding them. They went into the reception room familiar to\nPierre, with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory, with its\nlarge bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people\nwere still sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to\none another. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna\nMikháylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who,\nhanging his head, meekly followed her.\nAnna Mikháylovna’s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive\nmoment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now,\nkeeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than\nthat afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the dying\nman wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid glance\nat all those in the room and noticing the count’s confessor there, she glided\nup to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow\nsuddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing first of one and\nthen of another priest.\n“God be thanked that you are in time,” said she to one of the priests; “all\nwe relatives have been in such anxiety. This young man is the count’s son,”\nshe added more softly. “What a terrible moment!”\nHaving said this she went up to the doctor.\n“Dear doctor,” said she, “this young man is the count’s son. Is there any\nhope?”\nThe doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his\nshoulders. Anna Mikháylovna with just the same movement raised her\nshoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away from\nthe doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad\nvoice, she said:\n“Trust in His mercy!” and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and\nwait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching"}, {"page": 123, "text": "and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.\nPierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved\ntoward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikháylovna had\ndisappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with\nsomething more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they\nwhispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind of\nawe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before received\nwas shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to the priests,\nrose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up and returned a\nglove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully silent as he\npassed by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre wished to take\nanother seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the glove\nhimself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way; but all\nat once he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he was a person\nobliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him,\nand that he was therefore bound to accept their services. He took the glove\nin silence from the aide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady’s chair, placing\nhis huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naïve attitude of an\nEgyptian statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be,\nand that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act\non his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of\nthose who were guiding him.\nNot two minutes had passed before Prince Vasíli with head erect\nmajestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three stars\non his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning; his eyes\nseemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed Pierre. He\nwent up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do), and drew it\ndownwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on.\n“Courage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is well!”\nand he turned to go.\nBut Pierre thought it necessary to ask: “How is...” and hesitated, not\nknowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man “the count,” yet\nashamed to call him “father.”\n“He had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my friend...”\nPierre’s mind was in such a confused state that the word “stroke”\nsuggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vasíli in"}, {"page": 124, "text": "perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness.\nPrince Vasíli said something to Lorrain in passing and went through the\ndoor on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked\nat each step. The eldest princess followed him, and the priests and deacons\nand some servants also went in at the door. Through that door was heard a\nnoise of things being moved about, and at last Anna Mikháylovna, still with\nthe same expression, pale but resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and\ntouching Pierre lightly on the arm said:\n“The divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be administered.\nCome.”\nPierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed that the\nstrange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all followed him\nin, as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room."}, {"page": 125, "text": "CHAPTER XXIII\nPierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its\nwalls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the\ncolumns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on\nthe other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated with\nred light like a Russian church during evening service. Under the gleaming\nicons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair on snowy-white smooth\npillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre saw—covered to the waist by a\nbright green quilt—the familiar, majestic figure of his father, Count\nBezúkhov, with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which\nreminded one of a lion, and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his\nhandsome, ruddy face. He lay just under the icons; his large thick hands\noutside the quilt. Into the right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a\nwax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old\nservant, bending over from behind the chair, held it in position. By the chair\nstood the priests, their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering\nvestments, with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly\nconducting the service. A little behind them stood the two younger\nprincesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them\ntheir eldest sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed\non the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself\nshould she glance round. Anna Mikháylovna, with a meek, sorrowful, and\nall-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door near the strange lady.\nPrince Vasíli in front of the door, near the invalid chair, a wax taper in his\nleft hand, was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he\nhad turned round for the purpose, and was crossing himself with his right\nhand, turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead. His face\nwore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of God. “If you do not\nunderstand these sentiments,” he seemed to be saying, “so much the worse\nfor you!”"}, {"page": 126, "text": "Behind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants;\nthe men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing\nthemselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting of\ndeep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were\nthe only sounds that could be heard. Anna Mikháylovna, with an air of\nimportance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about,\nwent across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him a taper. He\nlit it and, distracted by observing those around him, began crossing himself\nwith the hand that held the taper.\nSophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole,\nwatched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained\nwith it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she again began\nto laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing, but\ncould not resist looking at him: so to be out of temptation she slipped\nquietly behind one of the columns. In the midst of the service the voices of\nthe priests suddenly ceased, they whispered to one another, and the old\nservant who was holding the count’s hand got up and said something to the\nladies. Anna Mikháylovna stepped forward and, stooping over the dying\nman, beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back. The French doctor held no\ntaper; he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude\nimplying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood\nthe full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of\nit. He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full\nvigor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the\nhand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a\nmoment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a stir\naround him, then the people resumed their places and the service continued.\nDuring this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasíli left the chair on which\nhe had been leaning, and—with an air which intimated that he knew what\nhe was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse\nfor them—did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined the\neldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the\nhigh bedstead with its silken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince\nVasíli and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned to their\nplaces one after the other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no\nmore attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having"}, {"page": 127, "text": "made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that\nevening was in some way essential.\nThe chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was heard\nrespectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the\nsacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around\nhim everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which\nAnna Mikháylovna’s was the most distinct.\nPierre heard her say:\n“Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be impossible...”\nThe sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants that\nPierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray mane—\nwhich, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight of for a\nsingle moment during the whole service. He judged by the cautious\nmovements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had\nlifted the dying man and were moving him.\n“Catch hold of my arm or you’ll drop him!” he heard one of the servants\nsay in a frightened whisper. “Catch hold from underneath. Here!”\nexclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the\nshuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the weight they were\ncarrying were too much for them.\nAs the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikháylovna, passed the young\nman he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the\ndying man’s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by\nthose who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly,\nleonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones,\nits handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was not\ndisfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre remembered\nit three months before, when the count had sent him to Petersburg. But now\nthis head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the\nbearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing.\nAfter a few minutes’ bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had\ncarried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikháylovna touched Pierre’s hand\nand said, “Come.” Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man\nhad been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed.\nHe lay with his head propped high on the pillows.

Either this\nlook meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look\nsomewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do,\nand glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikháylovna made a hurried\nsign with her eyes, glancing at the sick man’s hand and moving her lips as if\nto send it a kiss. Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the\nquilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy\nhand. Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count’s face stirred. Once\nmore Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikháylovna to see what he was\nto do next. Anna Mikháylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood\nbeside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing\nright. Anna Mikháylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell into the\nnaïvely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently distressed that his\nstout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look\nas small as possible. He looked at the count, who still gazed at the spot\nwhere Pierre’s face had been before he sat down. Anna Mikháylovna\nindicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of\nthese last moments of meeting between the father and son. This lasted about\ntwo minutes, which to Pierre seemed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles\nand lines of the count’s face began to twitch. The twitching increased, the\nhandsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how\nnear death his father was), and from that distorted mouth issued an\nindistinct, hoarse sound. Anna Mikháylovna looked attentively at the sick\nman’s eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then\nto some drink, then named Prince Vasíli in an inquiring whisper, then\npointed to the quilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience.\nHe made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of\nthe bed.\n“Wants to turn on the other side,” whispered the servant, and got up to\nturn the count’s heavy body toward the wall.\nPierre rose to help him.\nWhile the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back\nhelplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward.

At\nsight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a\ntickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes. The sick man was turned on\nto his side with his face to the wall. He sighed.\n“He is dozing,” said Anna Mikháylovna, observing that one of the\nprincesses was coming to take her turn at watching. “Let us go.”\nPierre went out."}, {"page": 130, "text": "CHAPTER XXIV\nThere was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasíli and the\neldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the Great\nand talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion they\nbecame silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she\nwhispered:\n“I can’t bear the sight of that woman.”\n“Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,” said Prince\nVasíli to Anna Mikháylovna. “Go and take something, my poor Anna\nMikháylovna, or you will not hold out.”\nTo Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze\nbelow the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikháylovna into the small\ndrawing room.\n“There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this\ndelicious Russian tea,” Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained\nanimation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup\nbefore a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular\nroom. Around the table all who were at Count Bezúkhov’s house that night\nhad gathered to fortify themselves. Pierre well remembered this small\ncircular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables. During balls given\nat the house Pierre, who did not know how to dance, had liked sitting in this\nroom to watch the ladies who, as they passed through in their ball dresses\nwith diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in\nthe brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times.\nNow this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table\ntea things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the night\na motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly\nwhispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none of\nthem forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the"}, {"page": 131, "text": "bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked\nto. He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going\non tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince Vasíli and the\neldest princess. Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and after a\nshort interval followed her. Anna Mikháylovna was standing beside the\nprincess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers.\n“Permit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not\nnecessary,” said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the same state\nof excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.\n“But, my dear princess,” answered Anna Mikháylovna blandly but\nimpressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other\nfrom passing, “won’t this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he\nneeds repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already\nprepared...”\nPrince Vasíli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude, with one\nleg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which were so flabby that they\nlooked heavier below, were twitching violently; but he wore the air of a\nman little concerned in what the two ladies were saying.\n“Come, my dear Anna Mikháylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You\nknow how fond the count is of her.”\n“I don’t even know what is in this paper,” said the younger of the two\nladies, addressing Prince Vasíli and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held\nin her hand. “All I know is that his real will is in his writing table, and this\nis a paper he has forgotten....”\nShe tried to pass Anna Mikháylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar her\npath.\n“I know, my dear, kind princess,” said Anna Mikháylovna, seizing the\nportfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily. “Dear\nprincess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous en\nconjure...”\nThe princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio\nwere the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if the princess did\nspeak, her words would not be flattering to Anna Mikháylovna. Though the\nlatter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and\nsoftness."}, {"page": 132, "text": "“Pierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a\nfamily consultation; is it not so, Prince?”\n“Why don’t you speak, cousin?” suddenly shrieked the princess so loud\nthat those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. “Why do you\nremain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere, making\na scene on the very threshold of a dying man’s room? Intriguer!” she hissed\nviciously, and tugged with all her might at the portfolio.\nBut Anna Mikháylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on\nthe portfolio, and changed her grip.\nPrince Vasíli rose. “Oh!” said he with reproach and surprise, “this is\nabsurd! Come, let go I tell you.”\nThe princess let go.\n“And you too!”\nBut Anna Mikháylovna did not obey him.\n“Let go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility.

Here, Pierre, tell them your opinion,” said\nshe, turning to the young man who, having come quite close, was gazing\nwith astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all\ndignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vasíli.\n“Remember that you will answer for the consequences,” said Prince\nVasíli severely. “You don’t know what you are doing.”\n“Vile woman!” shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna\nMikháylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.\nPrince Vasíli bent his head and spread out his hands.\nAt this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long and\nwhich had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged against\nthe wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands.\n“What are you doing!” she cried vehemently. “He is dying and you leave\nme alone with him!”\nHer sister dropped the portfolio.

He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was\nsitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre noticed\nthat he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an ague.\n“Ah, my friend!” said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was in his\nvoice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it before. “How\noften we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what?

Then after a pause she said:\n“He is no more....”\nPierre looked at her over his spectacles.\n“Come, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as\ntears.”\nShe led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could\nsee his face. Anna Mikháylovna left him, and when she returned he was fast\nasleep with his head on his arm.\nIn the morning Anna Mikháylovna said to Pierre:\n“Yes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you. But God\nwill support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command of an\nimmense fortune. The will has not yet been opened.

After her talk with Pierre, Anna\nMikháylovna returned to the Rostóvs’ and went to bed. On waking in the\nmorning she told the Rostóvs and all her acquaintances the details of Count\nBezúkhov’s death. She said the count had died as she would herself wish to\ndie, that his end was not only touching but edifying. As to the last meeting\nbetween father and son, it was so touching that she could not think of it\nwithout tears, and did not know which had behaved better during those\nawful moments—the father who so remembered everything and everybody\nat last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom it\nhad been pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though he tried hard to\nhide it in order not to sadden his dying father. “It is painful, but it does one\ngood. It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy\nson,” said she.

General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andréevich (nicknamed in\nsociety, “the King of Prussia”) ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him\nto his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter,\nPrincess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle Bourienne. Though in the\nnew reign he was free to return to the capitals, he still continued to live in\nthe country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the\nhundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one\nand nothing. He used to say that there are only two sources of human vice\n—idleness and superstition, and only two virtues—activity and intelligence.\nHe himself undertook his daughter’s education, and to develop these two\ncardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was\ntwenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied. He was\nhimself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving problems in higher\nmathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working in the garden, or\nsuperintending the building that was always going on at his estate. As\nregularity is a prime condition facilitating activity, regularity in his\nhousehold was carried to the highest point of exactitude. He always came to\ntable under precisely the same conditions, and not only at the same hour but\nat the same minute. With those about him, from his daughter to his serfs, the\nprince was sharp and invariably exacting, so that without being a\nhardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men\nwould have aroused. Although he was in retirement and had now no\ninfluence in political affairs, every high official appointed to the province in\nwhich the prince’s estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited\nin the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary\ndid, till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone"}, {"page": 136, "text": "sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even\nfear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of\na rather small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and\nbushy gray eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of\nhis shrewd, youthfully glittering eyes.\nOn the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess\nMary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the\nmorning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent\nprayer. Every morning she came in like that, and every morning prayed that\nthe daily interview might pass off well.\nAn old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose\nquietly and said in a whisper: “Please walk in.”\nThrough the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly\nopened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the\nentrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round\ncontinued his work.\nThe enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use. The\nlarge table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted bookcases\nwith keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while standing up, on\nwhich lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand\nand shavings scattered around—all indicated continuous, varied, and\norderly activity. The motion of the small foot shod in a Tartar boot\nembroidered with silver, and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand,\nshowed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of\nhardy old age. After a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from\nthe pedal, wiped his chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the\nlathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter. He never gave\nhis children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet\nunshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and attentively, said severely:\n“Quite well? All right then, sit down.” He took the exercise book\ncontaining lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair with\nhis foot.\n“For tomorrow!” said he, quickly finding the page and making a scratch\nfrom one paragraph to another with his hard nail.\nThe princess bent over the exercise book on the table."}, {"page": 137, "text": "“Wait a bit, here’s a letter for you,” said the old man suddenly, taking a\nletter addressed in a woman’s hand from a bag hanging above the table,\nonto which he threw it.\nAt the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the princess’\nface. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.\n“From Héloïse?” asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still\nsound, yellowish teeth.\n“Yes, it’s from Julie,” replied the princess with a timid glance and a timid\nsmile.\n“I’ll let two more letters pass, but the third I’ll read,” said the prince\nsternly; “I’m afraid you write much nonsense. I’ll read the third!”\n“Read this if you like, Father,” said the princess, blushing still more and\nholding out the letter.\n“The third, I said the third!” cried the prince abruptly, pushing the letter\naway, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the exercise\nbook containing geometrical figures.\n“Well, madam,” he began, stooping over the book close to his daughter\nand placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat, so that she felt\nherself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age and tobacco,\nwhich she had known so long. “Now, madam, these triangles are equal;\nplease note that the angle ABC...”\nThe princess looked in a scared way at her father’s eyes glittering close\nto her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was plain that she\nunderstood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her\nunderstanding any of her father’s further explanations, however clear they\nmight be. Whether it was the teacher’s fault or the pupil’s, this same thing\nhappened every day: the princess’ eyes grew dim, she could not see and\ncould not hear anything, but was only conscious of her stern father’s\nwithered face close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could\nthink only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the\nproblem in peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on\nwhich he was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control\nhimself and not become vehement, but almost always did become\nvehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book away.\nThe princess gave a wrong answer."}, {"page": 138, "text": "“Well now, isn’t she a fool!” shouted the prince, pushing the book aside\nand turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and down,\nlightly touched his daughter’s hair and sat down again.\nHe drew up his chair, and continued to explain.\n“This won’t do, Princess; it won’t do,” said he, when Princess Mary,\nhaving taken and closed the exercise book with the next day’s lesson, was\nabout to leave: “Mathematics are most important, madam! I don’t want to\nhave you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and you’ll like it,” and he\npatted her cheek. “It will drive all the nonsense out of your head.”\nShe turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut\nbook from the high desk.\n“Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Héloïse has sent you.\nReligious! I don’t interfere with anyone’s belief... I have looked at it. Take\nit. Well, now go. Go.”\nHe patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.\nPrincess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that\nrarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She sat\ndown at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and which was\nlittered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as her father was\ntidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her\nletter. It was from her most intimate friend from childhood; that same Julie\nKarágina who had been at the Rostóvs’ name-day party.\nJulie wrote in French:\nDear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is\nseparation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are\nwrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts\nare united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against fate and in spite of\nthe pleasures and distractions around me I cannot overcome a certain secret\nsorrow that has been in my heart ever since we parted. Why are we not\ntogether as we were last summer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the\nconfidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral\nstrength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so\nwell and seem to see before me as I write?\nHaving read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror\nwhich stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and thin"}, {"page": 139, "text": "face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness at her\nreflection in the glass. “She flatters me,” thought the princess, turning away\nand continuing to read. But Julie did not flatter her friend, the princess’ eyes\n—large, deep and luminous (it seemed as if at times there radiated from\nthem shafts of warm light)—were so beautiful that very often in spite of the\nplainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of\nbeauty. But the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes\n—the look they had when she was not thinking of herself. As with\neveryone, her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she\nlooked in a glass. She went on reading:\nAll Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already\nabroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march to the\nfrontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought intends to\nexpose his precious person to the chances of war.

I mean young\nNicholas Rostóv, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive\nand has left the university to join the army. I will confess to you, dear Mary,\nthat in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great\ngrief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer, is so\nnoble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds\nnowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly, he is so frank and\nhas so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that my relations with him,\ntransient as they were, have been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor\nheart, which has already suffered so much. Someday I will tell you about\nour parting and all that was said then. That is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend,\nyou are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows. You are\nfortunate, for the latter are generally the stronger! I know very well that\nCount Nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this\nsweet friendship, this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed.\nBut enough of this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the\ndeath of old Count Bezúkhov, and his inheritance. Fancy!

It is rumored that Prince Vasíli played a very\ndespicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg quite\ncrestfallen.\nI confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and\ninheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used to\nknow as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bezúkhov and the owner\nof one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to watch the\nchange in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable\ndaughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward him, though,\nbetween you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow. As for\nthe past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for\nme (most of whom I don’t even know), the matchmaking chronicles of\nMoscow now speak of me as the future Countess Bezúkhova. But you will\nunderstand that I have no desire for the post. À propos of marriages: do you\nknow that a while ago that universal auntie Anna Mikháylovna told me,\nunder the seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you.

I don’t know what you will think of it,\nbut I consider it my duty to let you know of it. He is said to be very\nhandsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is all I have been able to find out\nabout him.\nBut enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and\nMamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apráksins’.

Ah, my dear friend, our divine Saviour’s words, that it is\neasier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to\nenter the Kingdom of God, are terribly true.

She\nbrought into Princess Mary’s strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a\nquite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and self-satisfied.\n“Princess, I must warn you,” she added, lowering her voice and evidently\nlistening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with exaggerated\ngrasseyement, “the prince has been scolding Michael Ivánovich. He is in a\nvery bad humor, very morose. Be prepared.”\n“Ah, dear friend,” replied Princess Mary, “I have asked you never to\nwarn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge him\nand would not have others do so.”\nThe princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes\nlate in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting room\nwith a look of alarm.

From the far side of the house through\nthe closed doors came the sound of difficult passages—twenty times\nrepeated—of a sonata by Dussek.\nJust then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch.\nPrince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to alight, and let\nher pass into the house before him. Old Tíkhon, wearing a wig, put his head\nout of the door of the antechamber, reported in a whisper that the prince was\nsleeping, and hastily closed the door. Tíkhon knew that neither the son’s\narrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed\norder of the day. Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as Tíkhon; he\nlooked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father’s habits had\nchanged since he was at home last, and, having assured himself that they\nhad not, he turned to his wife.\n“He will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary’s room,” he\nsaid.\nThe little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes and\nher short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily\nand prettily as ever.\n“Why, this is a palace!” she said to her husband, looking around with the\nexpression with which people compliment their host at a ball. “Let’s come,\nquick, quick!” And with a glance round, she smiled at Tíkhon, at her\nhusband, and at the footman who accompanied them.\n“Is that Mary practicing? Let’s go quietly and take her by surprise.”\nPrince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.\n“You’ve grown older, Tíkhon,” he said in passing to the old man, who\nkissed his hand."}, {"page": 145, "text": "Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord\ncame, the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nrushed out apparently beside herself with delight.\n“Ah! what joy for the princess!” exclaimed she: “At last! I must let her\nknow.”\n“No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,” said the little\nprincess, kissing her. “I know you already through my sister-in-law’s\nfriendship for you. She was not expecting us?”\nThey went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound\nof the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and made\na grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.\nThe little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the middle,\na cry was heard, then Princess Mary’s heavy tread and the sound of kissing.\nWhen Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who had only met once\nbefore for a short time at his wedding, were in each other’s arms warmly\npressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch. Mademoiselle\nBourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart, with a beatific\nsmile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew\nshrugged his shoulders and frowned, as lovers of music do when they hear a\nfalse note. The two women let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of\nbeing too late, seized each other’s hands, kissing them and pulling them\naway, and again began kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince\nAndrew’s surprise both began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle\nBourienne also began to cry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to\nthe two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently\nit never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this\nmeeting.\n“Ah! my dear!... Ah! Mary!...” they suddenly exclaimed, and then\nlaughed. “I dreamed last night...”—“You were not expecting us?...” “Ah!\nMary, you have got thinner?...” “And you have grown stouter!...”\n“I knew the princess at once,” put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n“And I had no idea!...” exclaimed Princess Mary. “Ah, Andrew, I did not\nsee you.”\nPrince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and he\ntold her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary had turned"}, {"page": 146, "text": "toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm, gentle look of\nher large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment, rested on Prince\nAndrew’s face.\nThe little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip\ncontinually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and\ndrawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of\nglittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had had on\nthe Spásski Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition, and\nimmediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in\nPetersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here; and\nthat Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty Odýntsova had married an\nold man, and that there was a suitor for Mary, a real one, but that they\nwould talk of that later. Princess Mary was still looking silently at her\nbrother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness. It was plain\nthat she was following a train of thought independent of her sister-in-law’s\nwords. In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed\nher brother:\n“So you are really going to the war, Andrew?” she said sighing.\nLise sighed too.\n“Yes, and even tomorrow,” replied her brother.\n“He is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had\npromotion...”\nPrincess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of\nthought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure.\n“Is it certain?” she said.\nThe face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: “Yes, quite\ncertain. Ah! it is very dreadful...”\nHer lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law’s and\nunexpectedly again began to cry.\n“She needs rest,” said Prince Andrew with a frown. “Don’t you, Lise?\nTake her to your room and I’ll go to Father. How is he? Just the same?”\n“Yes, just the same. Though I don’t know what your opinion will be,”\nanswered the princess joyfully."}, {"page": 147, "text": "“And are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the\nlathe?” asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which\nshowed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was aware\nof his weaknesses.\n“The hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and my\ngeometry lessons,” said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons in\ngeometry were among the greatest delights of her life.\nWhen the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old\nprince to get up, Tíkhon came to call the young prince to his father. The old\nman made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son’s arrival:\nhe gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner.\nThe old prince always dressed in old-fashioned style, wearing an antique\ncoat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew entered his father’s\ndressing room (not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in\ndrawing rooms, but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre),\nthe old man was sitting on a large leather-covered chair, wrapped in a\npowdering mantle, entrusting his head to Tíkhon.\n“Ah! here’s the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?” said the old\nman, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which Tíkhon was\nholding fast to plait, would allow.\n“You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like this he’ll\nsoon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?” And he held out his\ncheek.\nThe old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He used\nto say that a nap “after dinner was silver—before dinner, golden.”) He cast\nhappy, sidelong glances at his son from under his thick, bushy eyebrows.\nPrince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him.\nHe made no reply on his father’s favorite topic—making fun of the military\nmen of the day, and more particularly of Bonaparte.\n“Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant,”\nsaid Prince Andrew, following every movement of his father’s face with an\neager and respectful look. “How is your health?”\n“Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from\nmorning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.”\n“Thank God,” said his son smiling."}, {"page": 148, "text": "“God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,” he continued, returning to\nhis hobby; “tell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonaparte by\nthis new science you call ‘strategy.’”\nPrince Andrew smiled.\n“Give me time to collect my wits, Father,” said he, with a smile that\nshowed that his father’s foibles did not prevent his son from loving and\nhonoring him. “Why, I have not yet had time to settle down!”\n“Nonsense, nonsense!” cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to see\nwhether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. “The house for\nyour wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and show her over, and\nthey’ll talk nineteen to the dozen. That’s their woman’s way! I am glad to\nhave her. Sit down and talk. About Mikhelson’s army I understand—\nTolstóy‘s too... a simultaneous expedition.... But what’s the southern army\nto do? Prussia is neutral... I know that. What about Austria?” said he, rising\nfrom his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by Tíkhon, who\nran after him, handing him different articles of clothing. “What of Sweden?\nHow will they cross Pomerania?”\nPrince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began—at first reluctantly,\nbut gradually with more and more animation, and from habit changing\nunconsciously from Russian to French as he went on—to explain the plan\nof operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an army, ninety\nthousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out of her\nneutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was to join some\nSwedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty thousand\nAustrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in Italy and\non the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to\nland at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to\nattack the French from different sides. The old prince did not evince the\nleast interest during this explanation, but as if he were not listening to it\ncontinued to dress while walking about, and three times unexpectedly\ninterrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: “The white one, the white\none!”\nThis meant that Tíkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.\nAnother time he interrupted, saying:\n“And will she soon be confined?” and shaking his head reproachfully\nsaid: “That’s bad! Go on, go on.”"}, {"page": 149, "text": "The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his\ndescription. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age:\n“Malbrook s’en va-t-en guerre.

Napoleon has also formed his plan by now, not worse than this\none.”\n“Well, you’ve told me nothing new,” and the old man repeated,\nmeditatively and rapidly:\n“Dieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room.”"}, {"page": 150, "text": "CHAPTER XXVII\nAt the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the\ndining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle\nBourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by a\nstrange caprice of his employer’s was admitted to table though the position\nof that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused\nhim to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept very strictly to\nsocial distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials\nto his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael Ivánovich (who always\nwent into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to\nillustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had more than once\nimpressed on his daughter that Michael Ivánovich was “not a whit worse\nthan you or I.” At dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Michael\nIvánovich more often than to anyone else.\nIn the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was\nexceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen—one\nbehind each chair—stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head butler,\nnapkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making signs to the\nfootmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the\nprince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large gilt frame, new to\nhim, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolkónski, opposite\nwhich hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait (evidently by\nthe hand of the artist belonging to the estate) of a ruling prince, in a crown\n—an alleged descendant of Rúrik and ancestor of the Bolkónskis. Prince\nAndrew, looking again at that genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as\na man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be\namusing.\n“How thoroughly like him that is!” he said to Princess Mary, who had\ncome up to him."}, {"page": 151, "text": "Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand\nwhat he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired her with\nreverence and was beyond question.\n“Everyone has his Achilles’ heel,” continued Prince Andrew. “Fancy,\nwith his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!”\nPrincess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother’s\ncriticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard\ncoming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his\nwont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the\nstrict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock struck two and\nanother with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room. The prince stood\nstill; his lively glittering eyes from under their thick, bushy eyebrows\nsternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess. She felt, as\ncourtiers do when the Tsar enters, the sensation of fear and respect which\nthe old man inspired in all around him. He stroked her hair and then patted\nher awkwardly on the back of her neck.\n“I’m glad, glad, to see you,” he said, looking attentively into her eyes,\nand then quickly went to his place and sat down. “Sit down, sit down! Sit\ndown, Michael Ivánovich!”\nHe indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman moved\nthe chair for her.\n“Ho, ho!” said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure.\n“You’ve been in a hurry. That’s bad!”\nHe laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only and\nnot with his eyes.\n“You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,” he said.\nThe little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was\nsilent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father, and she\nbegan to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances, and she\nbecame still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from\nvarious people and retelling the town gossip.\n“Countess Apráksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has cried\nher eyes out,” she said, growing more and more lively.\nAs she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly,\nand suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite"}, {"page": 152, "text": "idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael Ivánovich.\n“Well, Michael Ivánovich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of it.\nPrince Andrew” (he always spoke thus of his son) “has been telling me\nwhat forces are being collected against him! While you and I never thought\nmuch of him.”\nMichael Ivánovich did not at all know when “you and I” had said such\nthings about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on\nwhich to hang the prince’s favorite topic, he looked inquiringly at the young\nprince, wondering what would follow.\n“He is a great tactician!” said the prince to his son, pointing to the\narchitect.\nAnd the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the\ngenerals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not\nonly that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B\nC of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little\nFrenchy, successful only because there were no longer any Potëmkins or\nSuvórovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced that there were no\npolitical difficulties in Europe and no real war, but only a sort of puppet\nshow at which the men of the day were playing, pretending to do something\nreal. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father’s ridicule of the new men,\nand drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure.\n“The past always seems good,” said he, “but did not Suvórov himself fall\ninto a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to\nescape?”\n“Who told you that? Who?” cried the prince. “Suvórov!” And he jerked\naway his plate, which Tíkhon briskly caught. “Suvórov!... Consider, Prince\nAndrew. Two... Frederick and Suvórov; Moreau!... Moreau would have\nbeen a prisoner if Suvórov had had a free hand; but he had the Hofs-kriegs-\nwurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have puzzled the devil himself!\nWhen you get there you’ll find out what those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are!\nSuvórov couldn’t manage them so what chance has Michael Kutúzov? No,\nmy dear boy,” he continued, “you and your generals won’t get on against\nBuonaparte; you’ll have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may\nfight together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America,\nto fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,” he said, alluding to the invitation made\nthat year to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... “Wonderful!...

May God help you, but\nwe’ll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great commander\namong them! Hm!...”\n“I don’t at all say that all the plans are good,” said Prince Andrew, “I am\nonly surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You may laugh as much as you\nlike, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!”\n“Michael Ivánovich!” cried the old prince to the architect who, busy with\nhis roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: “Didn’t I tell you Buonaparte\nwas a great tactician? Here, he says the same thing.”\n“To be sure, your excellency,” replied the architect.\nThe prince again laughed his frigid laugh.\n“Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got\nsplendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only idlers\nhave failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began everybody has\nbeaten the Germans. They beat no one—except one another. He made his\nreputation fighting them.”\nAnd the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to\nhim, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His son\nmade no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were\npresented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He\nlistened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this old\nman, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and discuss\nso minutely and acutely all the recent European military and political\nevents.\n“You think I’m an old man and don’t understand the present state of\naffairs?” concluded his father. “But it troubles me. I don’t sleep at night.\nCome now, where has this great commander of yours shown his skill?” he\nconcluded.\n“That would take too long to tell,” answered the son.\n“Well, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, here’s\nanother admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,” he exclaimed in\nexcellent French.\n“You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!”"}, {"page": 154, "text": "“Dieu sait quand reviendra.” hummed the prince out of tune and, with a\nlaugh still more so, he quitted the table.\nThe little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner\nsat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her father-in-law and now\nat Princess Mary. When they left the table she took her sister-in-law’s arm\nand drew her into another room.\n“What a clever man your father is,” said she; “perhaps that is why I am\nafraid of him.”\n“Oh, he is so kind!” answered Princess Mary."}, {"page": 155, "text": "CHAPTER XXVIII\nPrince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not altering his\nroutine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was in her sister-in-\nlaw’s room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been\npacking with his valet in the rooms assigned to him. After inspecting the\ncarriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he ordered the horses to be\nharnessed. Only those things he always kept with him remained in his\nroom; a small box, a large canteen fitted with silver plate, two Turkish\npistols and a saber—a present from his father who had brought it from the\nsiege of Ochákov. All these traveling effects of Prince Andrew’s were in\nvery good order: new, clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes.\nWhen starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable\nof reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments one\nreviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrew’s face looked very\nthoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced briskly from\ncorner to corner of the room, looking straight before him and thoughtfully\nshaking his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was he sad at leaving his\nwife?—perhaps both, but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood,\nfor hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands,\nstopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box, and assumed his\nusual tranquil and impenetrable expression. It was the heavy tread of\nPrincess Mary that he heard.\n“I hear you have given orders to harness,” she cried, panting (she had\napparently been running), “and I did so wish to have another talk with you\nalone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not angry\nwith me for coming? You have changed so, Andrúsha,” she added, as if to\nexplain such a question.\nShe smiled as she uttered his pet name, “Andrúsha.” It was obviously\nstrange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be Andrúsha—\nthe slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood."}, {"page": 156, "text": "“And where is Lise?” he asked, answering her question only by a smile.\n“She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room. Oh,\nAndrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,” said she, sitting down on the\nsofa, facing her brother. “She is quite a child: such a dear, merry child. I\nhave grown so fond of her.”\nPrince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and\ncontemptuous look that showed itself on his face.\n“One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,\nAndrew? Don’t forget that she has grown up and been educated in society,\nand so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into everyone’s\nsituation. Tout comprendre, c’est tout pardonner. * Think what it must be\nfor her, poor thing, after what she has been used to, to be parted from her\nhusband and be left alone in the country, in her condition! It’s very hard.”\n* To understand all is to forgive all.\nPrince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we\nthink we thoroughly understand.\n“You live in the country and don’t think the life terrible,” he replied.\n“I... that’s different. Why speak of me? I don’t want any other life, and\ncan’t, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young society woman\nto be buried in the country during the best years of her life, all alone—for\nPapa is always busy, and I... well, you know what poor resources I have for\nentertaining a woman used to the best society. There is only Mademoiselle\nBourienne....”\n“I don’t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,” said Prince Andrew.\n“No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she’s much to be pitied.\nShe has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don’t need her, and she’s even in\nmy way. You know I always was a savage, and now am even more so. I like\nbeing alone.... Father likes her very much. She and Michael Ivánovich are\nthe two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has been a\nbenefactor to them both. As Sterne says: ‘We don’t love people so much for\nthe good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.’ Father\ntook her when she was homeless after losing her own father. She is very\ngood-natured, and my father likes her way of reading. She reads to him in\nthe evenings and reads splendidly.”"}, {"page": 157, "text": "“To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father’s character sometimes makes\nthings trying for you, doesn’t it?” Prince Andrew asked suddenly.\nPrincess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.\n“For me? For me?... Trying for me!...” said she.\n“He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he’s getting very\ntrying,” said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father in\norder to puzzle or test his sister.\n“You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual\npride,” said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather than\nthe trend of the conversation—“and that’s a great sin. How can one judge\nFather? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a\nman as my father evoke? And I am so contented and happy with him. I only\nwish you were all as happy as I am.”\nHer brother shook his head incredulously.\n“The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth, Andrew... is\nFather’s way of treating religious subjects. I don’t understand how a man of\nhis immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day, and can go so\nfar astray. That is the only thing that makes me unhappy. But even in this I\ncan see lately a shade of improvement. His satire has been less bitter of late,\nand there was a monk he received and had a long talk with.”\n“Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder,”\nsaid Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.\n“Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me. Andrew...”\nshe said timidly after a moment’s silence, “I have a great favor to ask of\nyou.”\n“What is it, dear?”\n“No—promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble and is\nnothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise, Andrúsha!...”\nsaid she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was\nholding inside it, as if what she held were the subject of her request and\nmust not be shown before the request was granted.\nShe looked timidly at her brother.\n“Even if it were a great deal of trouble...” answered Prince Andrew, as if\nguessing what it was about."}, {"page": 158, "text": "“Think what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as you\nplease, but do this for my sake! Please do!

To\nplease you...” said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing the pained\nexpression his joke had brought to his sister’s face, he repented and added:\n“I am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.”\n“Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you to\nHimself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,” said she in a voice trembling\nwith emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small,\noval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold setting, on a finely\nwrought silver chain.\nShe crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.\n“Please, Andrew, for my sake!...”\nRays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit up\nthe whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother would\nhave taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood, crossed\nhimself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for he was\ntouched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.\n“Thank you, my dear.” She kissed him on the forehead and sat down\nagain on the sofa. They were silent for a while.\n“As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always\nused to be. Don’t judge Lise harshly,” she began. “She is so sweet, so good-\nnatured, and her position now is a very hard one.”\n“I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, Másha, or blamed\nher. Why do you say all this to me?”\nRed patches appeared on Princess Mary’s face and she was silent as if\nshe felt guilty.\n“I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And I\nam sorry for that,” he went on."}, {"page": 159, "text": "The patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to\nsay something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little\nprincess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings\nabout her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her\nfate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen asleep.\nPrince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.\n“Know this, Másha: I can’t reproach, have not reproached, and never\nshall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself with\nanything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever\ncircumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if you\nwant to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this is\nso I don’t know...”\nAs he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed her\nforehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and unaccustomed\nbrightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the\ndarkness of the open doorway.\n“Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or—go and wake and I’ll come in\na moment.

It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and artless\nsmile, she had met him in secluded passages.\n“Oh! I thought you were in your room,” she said, for some reason\nblushing and dropping her eyes.\nPrince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly\ncame over his face.

Ha, ha, ha!\nMary!”\nThis very sentence about Countess Zúbova and this same laugh Prince\nAndrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five\ntimes. He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and rosy, was\nsitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking incessantly,\nrepeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince Andrew came\nup, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after their journey. She\nanswered him and continued her chatter.\nThe coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn\nnight, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole. Servants\nwith lanterns were bustling about in the porch.

The\nmembers of the household were all gathered in the reception hall: Michael\nIvánovich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary, and the little princess.\nPrince Andrew had been called to his father’s study as the latter wished to\nsay good-by to him alone.

They have been telling her things.\nShe has had a dream and is frightened.”\n“Hm... Hm...” muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he was\nwriting. “I’ll do it.”\nHe signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh.\n“It’s a bad business, eh?”\n“What is bad, Father?”\n“The wife!” said the old prince, briefly and significantly.\n“I don’t understand!” said Prince Andrew.\n“No, it can’t be helped, lad,” said the prince. “They’re all like that; one\ncan’t unmarry. Don’t be afraid; I won’t tell anyone, but you know it\nyourself.”\nHe seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked\nstraight into his son’s face with keen eyes which seemed to see through\nhim, and again laughed his frigid laugh.\nThe son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him.

Braunau was the headquarters of\nthe commander in chief, Kutúzov.\nOn October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached\nBraunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected by\nthe commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance of the locality\nand surroundings—fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs, and hills in the\ndistance—and despite the fact that the inhabitants (who gazed with\ncuriosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the regiment had just the\nappearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere\nin the heart of Russia.\nOn the evening of the last day’s march an order had been received that\nthe commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though\nthe words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and the\nquestion arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not, it\nwas decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present\nthe regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is always better to “bow\ntoo low than not bow low enough.” So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile\nmarch, were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their\neyes, while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and\nreckoned, and by morning the regiment—instead of the straggling,\ndisorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before—presented a\nwell-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and\nhis duty, had every button and every strap in place, and shone with\ncleanliness. And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the\ncommander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on\nevery man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of\narticles, “awl, soap, and all,” as the soldiers say. There was only one"}, {"page": 167, "text": "circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. It was the state of\nthe soldiers’ boots. More than half the men’s boots were in holes. But this\ndefect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for in spite of\nrepeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat,\nand the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.\nThe commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and\nthick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from\nchest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new uniform\nshowing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes\nwhich seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He\nhad the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of\nhis life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled\nhimself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander\nadmired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed\nby it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military matters, social\ninterests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts.\n“Well, Michael Mítrich, sir?” he said, addressing one of the battalion\ncommanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that they both felt\nhappy). “We had our hands full last night. However, I think the regiment is\nnot a bad one, eh?”\nThe battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.\n“It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsarítsin Meadow.”\n“What?” asked the commander.\nAt that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been\nposted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an aide-de-camp\nfollowed by a Cossack.\nThe aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been\nclearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief wished\nto see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march: in\ntheir greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation whatever.\nA member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutúzov the\nday before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of\nthe Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutúzov, not considering this\njunction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of his view, to\nshow the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived"}, {"page": 168, "text": "from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the regiment; so the\nworse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander in chief\nwould be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances, he\nnevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their\ngreatcoats and in marching order, and that the commander in chief would\notherwise be dissatisfied. On hearing this the regimental commander hung\nhis head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and spread out his arms with a\ncholeric gesture.\n“A fine mess we’ve made of it!” he remarked.\n“There now! Didn’t I tell you, Michael Mítrich, that if it was said ‘on the\nmarch’ it meant in greatcoats?” said he reproachfully to the battalion\ncommander. “Oh, my God!” he added, stepping resolutely forward.\n“Company commanders!” he shouted in a voice accustomed to command.\n“Sergeants major!... How soon will he be here?” he asked the aide-de-camp\nwith a respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he was\nreferring to.\n“In an hour’s time, I should say.”\n“Shall we have time to change clothes?”\n“I don’t know, General....”\nThe regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the\nsoldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders ran off\nto their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats were\nnot in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up to then\nbeen in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and hum with\nvoices. On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing up their\nknapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their\nheads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised\narms.\nIn half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray\ninstead of black. The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to\nthe front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.\n“Whatever is this?

The captain’s face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is\ntold to repeat a lesson he has not learned. Spots appeared on his nose, the\nredness of which was evidently due to intemperance, and his mouth\ntwitched nervously. The general looked the captain up and down as he came\nup panting, slackening his pace as he approached.\n“You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?”\nshouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing\nat a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth,\nwhich contrasted with the others. “What have you been after? The\ncommander in chief is expected and you leave your place? Eh? I’ll teach\nyou to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade.... Eh...?”\nThe commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior,\npressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this pressure\nlay his only hope of salvation.\n“Well, why don’t you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a\nHungarian?” said the commander with an austere gibe.\n“Your excellency...”\n“Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your\nexcellency?... nobody knows.”\n“Your excellency, it’s the officer Dólokhov, who has been reduced to the\nranks,” said the captain softly.\n“Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier? If a\nsoldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others.”\n“Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.”\n“Gave him leave? Leave? That’s just like you young men,” said the\nregimental commander cooling down a little. “Leave indeed.... One says a\nword to you and you... What?” he added with renewed irritation, “I beg you\nto dress your men decently.”\nAnd the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky\nsteps down the line.

Your leg?” shouted the\ncommander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were still five\nmen between him and Dólokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.\nDólokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his\nclear, insolent eyes in the general’s face.\n“Why a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his coat... the\nras...” he did not finish.\n“General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...” Dólokhov\nhurriedly interrupted.\n“No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!”\n“Not bound to endure insults,” Dólokhov concluded in loud, ringing\ntones.\nThe eyes of the general and the soldier met.

The regiment fluttered like a bird preening\nits plumage and became motionless.\n“Att-ention!” shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking voice\nwhich expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and welcome for\nthe approaching chief.\nAlong the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high,\nlight blue Viennese calèche, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by\nsix horses at a smart trot. Behind the calèche galloped the suite and a\nconvoy of Croats. Beside Kutúzov sat an Austrian general, in a white\nuniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones. The calèche\nstopped in front of the regiment. Kutúzov and the Austrian general were\ntalking in low voices and Kutúzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he\nstepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men\nbreathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist.\nThe word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with\na jingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence the feeble\nvoice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment roared, “Health to\nyour ex... len... len... lency!” and again all became silent. At first Kutúzov\nstood still while the regiment moved; then he and the general in white,\naccompanied by the suite, walked between the ranks.\nFrom the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief\nand devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and\nfrom the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending\nforward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way"}, {"page": 172, "text": "he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief, it\nwas evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater\nzeal than his duty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness and assiduity of\nits commander the regiment, in comparison with others that had reached\nBraunau at the same time, was in splendid condition. There were only 217\nsick and stragglers. Everything was in good order except the boots.\nKutúzov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few\nfriendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes also\nto the soldiers. Looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly,\npointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression which seemed\nto say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help noticing what a\nbad state of things it was. The regimental commander ran forward on each\nsuch occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chief’s\nregarding the regiment. Behind Kutúzov, at a distance that allowed every\nsoftly spoken word to be heard, followed some twenty men of his suite.\nThese gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed. Nearest\nof all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant. This was\nPrince Bolkónski. Beside him was his comrade Nesvítski, a tall staff officer,\nextremely stout, with a kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes.\nNesvítski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar\nofficer who walked beside him. This hussar, with a grave face and without a\nsmile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the\nregimental commander’s back and mimicked his every movement. Each\ntime the commander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent\nforward in exactly the same manner. Nesvítski laughed and nudged the\nothers to make them look at the wag.\nKutúzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were\nstarting from their sockets to watch their chief. On reaching the third\ncompany he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected this,\ninvoluntarily came closer to him.\n“Ah, Timókhin!” said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had\nbeen reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.\nOne would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more\nthan Timókhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental\ncommander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew\nhimself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it"}, {"page": 173, "text": "had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so Kutúzov, who\nevidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good, quickly\nturned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puffy\nface.\n“Another Ismail comrade,” said he. “A brave officer! Are you satisfied\nwith him?” he asked the regimental commander.\nAnd the latter—unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar\nofficer as in a looking glass—started, moved forward, and answered:\n“Highly satisfied, your excellency!”\n“We all have our weaknesses,” said Kutúzov smiling and walking away\nfrom him. “He used to have a predilection for Bacchus.”\nThe regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and\ndid not answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed\ncaptain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose\nwith such exactitude that Nesvítski could not help laughing. Kutúzov turned\nround. The officer evidently had complete control of his face, and while\nKutúzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most\nserious, deferential, and innocent expression.\nThe third company was the last, and Kutúzov pondered, apparently trying\nto recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the\nsuite and said in French:\n“You told me to remind you of the officer Dólokhov, reduced to the ranks\nin this regiment.”\n“Where is Dólokhov?” asked Kutúzov.\nDólokhov, who had already changed into a soldier’s gray greatcoat, did\nnot wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired soldier, with his\nclear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went up to the commander\nin chief, and presented arms.\n“Have you a complaint to make?” Kutúzov asked with a slight frown.\n“This is Dólokhov,” said Prince Andrew.\n“Ah!” said Kutúzov. “I hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your duty.\nThe Emperor is gracious, and I shan’t forget you if you deserve well.”\nThe clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as\nthey had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression"}, {"page": 174, "text": "to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so\nwidely from a private.\n“One thing I ask of your excellency,” Dólokhov said in his firm, ringing,\ndeliberate voice. “I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my\ndevotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!”\nKutúzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes with which he had\nturned from Captain Timókhin again flitted over his face. He turned away\nwith a grimace as if to say that everything Dólokhov had said to him and\neverything he could say had long been known to him, that he was weary of\nit and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away and went to the\ncarriage.\nThe regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed\nquarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to\nrest after their hard marches.\n“You won’t bear me a grudge, Prokhór Ignátych?” said the regimental\ncommander, overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and\nriding up to Captain Timókhin who was walking in front. (The regimental\ncommander’s face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with\nirrepressible delight.) “It’s in the Emperor’s service... it can’t be helped...\none is sometimes a bit hasty on parade... I am the first to apologize, you\nknow me!... He was very pleased!” And he held out his hand to the captain.\n“Don’t mention it, General, as if I’d be so bold!” replied the captain, his\nnose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front\nteeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at\nIsmail.\n“And tell Mr. Dólokhov that I won’t forget him—he may be quite easy.\nAnd tell me, please—I’ve been meaning to ask—how is he behaving\nhimself, and in general...”\n“As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency; but\nhis character...” said Timókhin.\n“And what about his character?” asked the regimental commander.\n“It’s different on different days,” answered the captain. “One day he is\nsensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next he’s a wild beast....\nIn Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.”"}, {"page": 175, "text": "“Oh, well, well!” remarked the regimental commander. “Still, one must\nhave pity on a young man in misfortune.

God be praised!” and he rode past that company and\novertook the next one.\n“Well, he’s really a good fellow, one can serve under him,” said\nTimókhin to the subaltern beside him.\n“In a word, a hearty one...” said the subaltern, laughing (the regimental\ncommander was nicknamed King of Hearts).\nThe cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the\nsoldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiers’ voices could be\nheard on every side.\n“And they said Kutúzov was blind of one eye?”\n“And so he is!

A\ndrummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing his\narm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers’ song, commencing with the words:\n“Morning dawned, the sun was rising,” and concluding: “On then,\nbrothers, on to glory, led by Father Kámenski.” This song had been\ncomposed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the only\nchange being that the words “Father Kámenski” were replaced by “Father\nKutúzov.”\nHaving jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as\nif flinging something to the ground, the drummer—a lean, handsome\nsoldier of forty—looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes.\nThen having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him, he raised\nboth arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his\nhead and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly flung it down and\nbegan:\n“Oh, my bower, oh, my bower...!”\n“Oh, my bower new...!” chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet player,\nin spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front and, walking"}, {"page": 177, "text": "backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and flourished his\ncastanets as if threatening someone. The soldiers, swinging their arms and\nkeeping time spontaneously, marched with long steps. Behind the company\nthe sound of wheels, the creaking of springs, and the tramp of horses’ hoofs\nwere heard. Kutúzov and his suite were returning to the town. The\ncommander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at\nease, and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing\nand the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men.\nIn the second file from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the\ncompany, a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice. It was\nDólokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song\nand looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that\nmoment marching with the company. The hussar cornet of Kutúzov’s suite\nwho had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the carriage\nand rode up to Dólokhov.\nHussar cornet Zherkóv had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to the\nwild set led by Dólokhov. Zherkóv had met Dólokhov abroad as a private\nand had not seen fit to recognize him.

They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto the\nstaff?”\n“I was attached; I’m on duty.”\nBoth were silent.\n“She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve,” went the song,\narousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness.

It\nwas evident that Kutúzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice.\n“All I can say, General, is that if the matter depended on my personal\nwishes, the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have been\nfulfilled long ago. I should long ago have joined the archduke. And believe\nme on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over\nthe supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and\nmore skillful general—of whom Austria has so many—and to lay down all\nthis heavy responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for\nus, General.”\nAnd Kutúzov smiled in a way that seemed to say, “You are quite at\nliberty not to believe me and I don’t even care whether you do or not, but\nyou have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole point.”\nThe Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply in\nthe same tone.\n“On the contrary,” he said, in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted\nwith his flattering words, “on the contrary, your excellency’s participation"}, {"page": 180, "text": "in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty; but we think the\npresent delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their commander\nof the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles,” he\nconcluded his evidently prearranged sentence.\nKutúzov bowed with the same smile.\n“But that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which His\nHighness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the\nAustrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack,\nhave by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid,”\nsaid Kutúzov.\nThe general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian\ndefeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors\nthat were afloat, and so Kutúzov’s suggestion of an Austrian victory\nsounded much like irony. But Kutúzov went on blandly smiling with the\nsame expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so.\nAnd, in fact, the last letter he had received from Mack’s army informed him\nof a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very\nfavorable.\n“Give me that letter,” said Kutúzov turning to Prince Andrew. “Please\nhave a look at it”—and Kutúzov with an ironical smile about the corners of\nhis mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage, in German,\nfrom the Archduke Ferdinand’s letter:\nWe have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with\nwhich to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also, as we\nare masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of\ncommanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not cross\nthe Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line of\ncommunications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his intention\nshould he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally. We shall\ntherefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial Russian army\nwill be fully equipped, and shall then, in conjunction with it, easily find a\nway to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves.\nKutúzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the\nmember of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.\n“But you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect\nthe worst,” said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have done with"}, {"page": 181, "text": "jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked round at the aide-de-\ncamp.\n“Excuse me, General,” interrupted Kutúzov, also turning to Prince\nAndrew. “Look here, my dear fellow, get from Kozlóvski all the reports\nfrom our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is one\nfrom His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these,” he said,\nhanding him several papers, “make a neat memorandum in French out of all\nthis, showing all the news we have had of the movements of the Austrian\narmy, and then give it to his excellency.”\nPrince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the\nfirst not only what had been said but also what Kutúzov would have liked to\ntell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both, stepped softly\nover the carpet and went out into the waiting room.\nThough not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia,\nhe had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his face, in\nhis movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former affected\nlanguor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time to think of\nthe impression he makes on others, but is occupied with agreeable and\ninteresting work. His face expressed more satisfaction with himself and\nthose around him, his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive.\nKutúzov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very\nkindly, promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other\nadjutants, and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious\ncommissions. From Vienna Kutúzov wrote to his old comrade, Prince\nAndrew’s father.\nYour son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry,\nfirmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to have such a\nsubordinate by me.\nOn Kutúzov’s staff, among his fellow officers and in the army generally,\nPrince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two quite opposite\nreputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be different from\nthemselves and from everyone else, expected great things of him, listened\nto him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince Andrew was\nnatural and pleasant. Others, the majority, disliked him and considered him\nconceited, cold, and disagreeable. But among these people Prince Andrew\nknew how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him."}, {"page": 182, "text": "Coming out of Kutúzov’s room into the waiting room with the papers in\nhis hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp on duty,\nKozlóvski, who was sitting at the window with a book.\n“Well, Prince?” asked Kozlóvski.\n“I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not\nadvancing.”\n“And why is it?”\nPrince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.\n“Any news from Mack?”\n“No.”\n“If it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come.”\n“Probably,” said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.\nBut at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the order of\nMaria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head, who had\nevidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door. Prince Andrew\nstopped short.\n“Commander in Chief Kutúzov?” said the newly arrived general\nspeaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and\nadvancing straight toward the inner door.\n“The commander in chief is engaged,” said Kozlóvski, going hurriedly\nup to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door. “Whom shall I\nannounce?”\nThe unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlóvski, who was\nrather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.\n“The commander in chief is engaged,” repeated Kozlóvski calmly.\nThe general’s face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He took out a\nnotebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the leaf, gave it\nto Kozlóvski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw himself into a chair,\ngazing at those in the room as if asking, “Why do they look at me?” Then\nhe lifted his head, stretched his neck as if he intended to say something, but\nimmediately, with affected indifference, began to hum to himself, producing\na queer sound which immediately broke off. The door of the private room\nopened and Kutúzov appeared in the doorway. The general with the"}, {"page": 183, "text": "bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger,\nand, making long, quick strides with his thin legs, went up to Kutúzov.\n“Vous voyez le malheureux Mack,” he uttered in a broken voice.\nKutúzov’s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly\nimmobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave\nand his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully,\nclosed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed the\ndoor himself behind him.\nThe report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten\nand that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct.\nWithin half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with\norders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been\ninactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.\nPrince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest\nlay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack and heard the\ndetails of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost,\nunderstood all the difficulties of the Russian army’s position, and vividly\nimagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play. Involuntarily\nhe felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant\nAustria and that in a week’s time he might, perhaps, see and take part in the\nfirst Russian encounter with the French since Suvórov met them. He feared\nthat Bonaparte’s genius might outweigh all the courage of the Russian\ntroops, and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero being\ndisgraced.\nExcited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his\nroom to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the corridor he\nmet Nesvítski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag Zherkóv; they\nwere as usual laughing.\n“Why are you so glum?” asked Nesvítski noticing Prince Andrew’s pale\nface and glittering eyes.\n“There’s nothing to be gay about,” answered Bolkónski.\nJust as Prince Andrew met Nesvítski and Zherkóv, there came toward\nthem from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general who\nwas on Kutúzov’s staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian army,\nand the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening."}, {"page": 184, "text": "There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the\nthree officers quite easily, but Zherkóv, pushing Nesvítski aside with his\narm, said in a breathless voice,\n“They’re coming!... they’re coming!... Stand aside, make way, please\nmake way!”\nThe generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid\nembarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag Zherkóv there suddenly\nappeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.\n“Your excellency,” said he in German, stepping forward and addressing\nthe Austrian general, “I have the honor to congratulate you.”\nHe bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the\nother, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.\nThe member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing the\nseriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a moment’s\nattention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.\n“I have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived, quite\nwell, only a little bruised just here,” he added, pointing with a beaming\nsmile to his head.\nThe general frowned, turned away, and went on.\n“Gott, wie naiv!” * said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.\n* “Good God, what simplicity!”\nNesvítski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but\nBolkónski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and\nturned to Zherkóv. The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of\nMack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the\nRussian army found vent in anger at Zherkóv’s untimely jest.\n“If you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself,” he said sharply, with a\nslight trembling of the lower jaw, “I can’t prevent your doing so; but I warn\nyou that if you dare to play the fool in my presence, I will teach you to\nbehave yourself.”\nNesvítski and Zherkóv were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed\nat Bolkónski silently with wide-open eyes.\n“What’s the matter? I only congratulated them,” said Zherkóv."}, {"page": 185, "text": "“I am not jesting with you; please be silent!” cried Bolkónski, and taking\nNesvítski’s arm he left Zherkóv, who did not know what to say.\n“Come, what’s the matter, old fellow?” said Nesvítski trying to soothe\nhim.\n“What’s the matter?” exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in his\nexcitement. “Don’t you understand that either we are officers serving our\nTsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the\nmisfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely lackeys who care\nnothing for their master’s business.

Cadet Rostóv, ever since he\nhad overtaken the regiment in Poland, had lived with the squadron\ncommander.\nOn October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news\nof Mack’s defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was\nproceeding as usual. Denísov, who had been losing at cards all night, had\nnot yet come home when Rostóv rode back early in the morning from a\nforaging expedition. Rostóv in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his horse,\nrode up to the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful\nmovement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his\nhorse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.\n“Ah, Bondarénko, dear friend!” said he to the hussar who rushed up\nheadlong to the horse. “Walk him up and down, my dear fellow,” he\ncontinued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young\npeople show to everyone when they are happy.\n“Yes, your excellency,” answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his head.\n“Mind, walk him up and down well!”\nAnother hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondarénko had\nalready thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse’s head.

I knew it,” replied a piping voice, and\nLieutenant Telyánin, a small officer of the same squadron, entered the\nroom.\nRostóv thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand\nwhich was offered him. Telyánin for some reason had been transferred from\nthe Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very well in the regiment\nbut was not liked; Rostóv especially detested him and was unable to\novercome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man.\n“Well, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?” he asked.

Feel in your pockets.”\n“No, if I hadn’t thought of it being a treasure,” said Rostóv, “but I\nremember putting it there.”\nLavrúshka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under\nthe table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the room.\nDenísov silently watched Lavrúshka’s movements, and when the latter\nthrew up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found Denísov\nglanced at Rostóv.\n“Wostóv, you’ve not been playing schoolboy twicks...”\nRostóv felt Denísov’s gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and instantly\ndropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere"}, {"page": 192, "text": "below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not draw breath.\n“And there hasn’t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and\nyourselves. It must be here somewhere,” said Lavrúshka.\n“Now then, you devil’s puppet, look alive and hunt for it!” shouted\nDenísov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening\ngesture. “If the purse isn’t found I’ll flog you, I’ll flog you all.”\nRostóv, his eyes avoiding Denísov, began buttoning his coat, buckled on\nhis saber, and put on his cap.\n“I must have that purse, I tell you,” shouted Denísov, shaking his orderly\nby the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.\n“Denísov, let him alone, I know who has taken it,” said Rostóv, going\ntoward the door without raising his eyes. Denísov paused, thought a\nmoment, and, evidently understanding what Rostóv hinted at, seized his\narm.\n“Nonsense!” he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out\nlike cords. “You are mad, I tell you. I won’t allow it. The purse is here! I’ll\nflay this scoundwel alive, and it will be found.”\n“I know who has taken it,” repeated Rostóv in an unsteady voice, and\nwent to the door.\n“And I tell you, don’t you dahe to do it!” shouted Denísov, rushing at the\ncadet to restrain him.\nBut Rostóv pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though\nDenísov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face.\n“Do you understand what you’re saying?” he said in a trembling voice.\n“There was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it is not so,\nthen...”\nHe could not finish, and ran out of the room.\n“Ah, may the devil take you and evewybody,” were the last words\nRostóv heard.\nRostóv went to Telyánin’s quarters.\n“The master is not in, he’s gone to headquarters,” said Telyánin’s orderly.\n“Has something happened?” he added, surprised at the cadet’s troubled\nface.\n“No, nothing.”"}, {"page": 193, "text": "“You’ve only just missed him,” said the orderly.\nThe headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and\nRostóv, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was an\ninn in the village which the officers frequented. Rostóv rode up to it and\nsaw Telyánin’s horse at the porch.\nIn the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of\nsausages and a bottle of wine.\n“Ah, you’ve come here too, young man!” he said, smiling and raising his\neyebrows.\n“Yes,” said Rostóv as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word; and he\nsat down at the nearest table.\nBoth were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the\nroom. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives\nand the munching of the lieutenant.\nWhen Telyánin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double\npurse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, turned-up fingers,\ndrew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter.\n“Please be quick,” he said.\nThe coin was a new one. Rostóv rose and went up to Telyánin.\n“Allow me to look at your purse,” he said in a low, almost inaudible,\nvoice.\nWith shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Telyánin handed him the\npurse.\n“Yes, it’s a nice purse. Yes, yes,” he said, growing suddenly pale, and\nadded, “Look at it, young man.”\nRostóv took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and\nlooked at Telyánin. The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and\nsuddenly seemed to grow very merry.\n“If we get to Vienna I’ll get rid of it there but in these wretched little\ntowns there’s nowhere to spend it,” said he. “Well, let me have it, young\nman, I’m going.”\nRostóv did not speak.\n“And you?

What? How dare you? What?” said Telyánin.\nBut these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for\npardon. As soon as Rostóv heard them, an enormous load of doubt fell from\nhim. He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man\nwho stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be completed.\n“Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine,” muttered\nTelyánin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room. “We\nmust have an explanation...”\n“I know it and shall prove it,” said Rostóv.\n“I...”\nEvery muscle of Telyánin’s pale, terrified face began to quiver, his eyes\nstill shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to\nRostóv’s face, and his sobs were audible.\n“Count!...

And there it rests. He may keep me on duty every\nday, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make me apologize,\nbecause if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it beneath his dignity\nto give me satisfaction, then...”\n“You just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,” interrupted the\nstaff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache. “You tell\nthe colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen...”\n“I’m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other\nofficers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am not a\ndiplomatist.

No one thinks you a coward, but that’s not the point.\nAsk Denísov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand\nsatisfaction of his regimental commander?”\nDenísov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the\nconversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it.

The case is this:\nyou ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice; but no, you go\nand blurt it all straight out before the officers. Now what was the colonel to\ndo? Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the\nwhole regiment because of one scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We\ndon’t see it like that. And Bogdánich was a brick: he told you you were\nsaying what was not true. It’s not pleasant, but what’s to be done, my dear\nfellow? You landed yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the\nthing over, some conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make\nthe whole affair public. You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why\nnot apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever Bogdánich may\nbe, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel!

On October 23 the\nRussian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday the Russian\nbaggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were defiling through the\ntown of Enns on both sides of the bridge.\nIt was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out\nbefore the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge\nwas at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and then,\nsuddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could be clearly seen\nglittering as though freshly varnished. Down below, the little town could be\nseen with its white, red-roofed houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both\nsides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops. At the bend of\nthe Danube, vessels, an island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the\nwaters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube became visible, and\nthe rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic\nbackground of green treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent\nstood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of\nthe Enns the enemy’s horse patrols could be discerned.\nAmong the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of\nthe rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through his\nfieldglass. A little behind them Nesvítski, who had been sent to the\nrearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a gun\ncarriage. A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and\na flask, and Nesvítski was treating some officers to pies and real\ndoppelkümmel. The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their\nknees, some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass.\n“Yes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. It’s a fine\nplace! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?” Nesvítski was saying."}, {"page": 200, "text": "“Thank you very much, Prince,” answered one of the officers, pleased to\nbe talking to a staff officer of such importance. “It’s a lovely place! We\npassed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a splendid house!”\n“Look, Prince,” said another, who would have dearly liked to take\nanother pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the\ncountryside—“See, our infantrymen have already got there. Look there in\nthe meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging something.\nThey’ll ransack that castle,” he remarked with evident approval.\n“So they will,” said Nesvítski. “No, but what I should like,” added he,\nmunching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, “would be to slip in\nover there.”\nHe pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed and\ngleamed.\n“That would be fine, gentlemen!”\nThe officers laughed.\n“Just to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls among them.\nOn my word I’d give five years of my life for it!”\n“They must be feeling dull, too,” said one of the bolder officers,\nlaughing.\nMeanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the\ngeneral, who looked through his field glass.\n“Yes, so it is, so it is,” said the general angrily, lowering the field glass\nand shrugging his shoulders, “so it is! They’ll be fired on at the crossing.\nAnd why are they dawdling there?”\nOn the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from\ntheir battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant report of a\nshot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.\nNesvítski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.\n“Would not your excellency like a little refreshment?” he said.\n“It’s a bad business,” said the general without answering him, “our men\nhave been wasting time.”\n“Hadn’t I better ride over, your excellency?” asked Nesvítski.\n“Yes, please do,” answered the general, and he repeated the order that\nhad already once been given in detail: “and tell the hussars that they are to"}, {"page": 201, "text": "cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the inflammable material\non the bridge must be reinspected.”\n“Very good,” answered Nesvítski.\nHe called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack\nand flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.\n“I’ll really call in on the nuns,” he said to the officers who watched him\nsmilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the hill.\n“Now then, let’s see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!” said the\ngeneral, turning to an artillery officer. “Have a little fun to pass the time.”\n“Crew, to your guns!” commanded the officer.\nIn a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began\nloading.\n“One!” came the command.\nNumber one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening\nmetallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops\nbelow the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke showing the\nspot where it burst.\nThe faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone got\nup and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly\nvisible as if but a stone’s throw away, and the movements of the\napproaching enemy farther off. At the same instant the sun came fully out\nfrom behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the\nbrilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited\nimpression."}, {"page": 202, "text": "CHAPTER VII\nTwo of the enemy’s shots had already flown across the bridge, where\nthere was a crush. Halfway across stood Prince Nesvítski, who had alighted\nfrom his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings. He\nlooked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few steps behind him\nholding two horses by their bridles. Each time Prince Nesvítski tried to\nmove on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against\nthe railings, and all he could do was to smile.\n“What a fine fellow you are, friend!” said the Cossack to a convoy\nsoldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were\ncrowded together close to his wheels and his horses. “What a fellow! You\ncan’t wait a moment! Don’t you see the general wants to pass?”\nBut the convoyman took no notice of the word “general” and shouted at\nthe soldiers who were blocking his way. “Hi there, boys! Keep to the left!\nWait a bit.” But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to shoulder, their\nbayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a dense mass. Looking\ndown over the rails Prince Nesvítski saw the rapid, noisy little waves of the\nEnns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each\nother along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of\nsoldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos, knapsacks, bayonets, long\nmuskets, and, under the shakos, faces with broad cheekbones, sunken\ncheeks, and listless tired expressions, and feet that moved through the sticky\nmud that covered the planks of the bridge. Sometimes through the\nmonotonous waves of men, like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the\nEnns, an officer, in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the\nmen, squeezed his way along; sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in\nthe river, an hussar on foot, an orderly, or a townsman was carried through\nthe waves of infantry; and sometimes like a log floating down the river, an\nofficers’ or company’s baggage wagon, piled high, leather covered, and\nhemmed in on all sides, moved across the bridge."}, {"page": 203, "text": "“It’s as if a dam had burst,” said the Cossack hopelessly. “Are there many\nmore of you to come?”\n“A million all but one!” replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat, with a\nwink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.\n“If he” (he meant the enemy) “begins popping at the bridge now,” said\nthe old soldier dismally to a comrade, “you’ll forget to scratch yourself.”\nThat soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart.\n“Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?” said an orderly,\nrunning behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.\nAnd he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry soldiers\nwho had evidently been drinking.\n“And then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of\nhis gun...” a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily, with a\nwide swing of his arm.\n“Yes, the ham was just delicious...” answered another with a loud laugh.\nAnd they, too, passed on, so that Nesvítski did not learn who had been\nstruck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.\n“Bah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think they’ll all be\nkilled,” a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.\n“As it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean,” said a young soldier with an\nenormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, “I felt like dying of\nfright. I did, ‘pon my word, I got that frightened!” said he, as if bragging of\nhaving been frightened.\nThat one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone\nbefore. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German, and\nseemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine brindled cow with a\nlarge udder was attached to the cart behind. A woman with an unweaned\nbaby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks were\nsitting on some feather beds. Evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass\nby special permission. The eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the\nwomen, and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers’\nremarks related to the two young ones. Every face bore almost the same\nsmile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the women.\n“Just see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!”"}, {"page": 204, "text": "“Sell me the missis,” said another soldier, addressing the German, who,\nangry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast eyes.\n“See how smart she’s made herself!

Nesvítski like the rest of the men on the\nbridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed. When they\nhad gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same kind of\ntalk, and at last all stopped. As often happens, the horses of a convoy wagon\nbecame restive at the end of the bridge, and the whole crowd had to wait.\n“And why are they stopping? There’s no proper order!” said the soldiers.\n“Where are you shoving to? Devil take you! Can’t you wait? It’ll be worse\nif he fires the bridge. See, here’s an officer jammed in too”—different\nvoices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked at one another, and all\npressed toward the exit from the bridge.\nLooking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, Nesvítski\nsuddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching...\nsomething big, that splashed into the water.\n“Just see where it carries to!” a soldier near by said sternly, looking\nround at the sound.\n“Encouraging us to get along quicker,” said another uneasily.\nThe crowd moved on again. Nesvítski realized that it was a cannon ball.\n“Hey, Cossack, my horse!” he said. “Now, then, you there! get out of the\nway! Make way!”\nWith great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting\ncontinually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way\nfor him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those\nnearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still harder\nfrom behind."}, {"page": 205, "text": "“Nesvítski, Nesvítski! you numskull!” came a hoarse voice from behind\nhim.\nNesvítski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated\nby the living mass of moving infantry, Váska Denísov, red and shaggy, with\nhis cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his\nshoulder.\n“Tell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!” shouted Denísov\nevidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot whites\nglittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as\nred as his face.\n“Ah, Váska!” joyfully replied Nesvítski. “What’s up with you?”\n“The squadwon can’t pass,” shouted Váska Denísov, showing his white\nteeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which twitched its\nears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting white foam from his\nbit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs, and apparently ready\nto jump over the railings had his rider let him. “What is this? They’re like\nsheep! Just like sheep! Out of the way!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you\ndevil with the cart! I’ll hack you with my saber!” he shouted, actually\ndrawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it.\nThe soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and\nDenísov joined Nesvítski.\n“How’s it you’re not drunk today?” said Nesvítski when the other had\nridden up to him.\n“They don’t even give one time to dwink!” answered Váska Denísov.\n“They keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day.

I’m going into action! I’ve shaved, bwushed my teeth, and\nscented myself.”\nThe imposing figure of Nesvítski followed by his Cossack, and the\ndetermination of Denísov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically,\nhad such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side"}, {"page": 206, "text": "of the bridge and stopped the infantry.

Only Denísov’s squadron of hussars remained on the farther side\nof the bridge facing the enemy, who could be seen from the hill on the\nopposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge, for the horizon as\nseen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the\nrising ground only half a mile away. At the foot of the hill lay wasteland\nover which a few groups of our Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on\nthe road at the top of the high ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform\nwere seen. These were the French. A group of Cossack scouts retired down\nthe hill at a trot. All the officers and men of Denísov’s squadron, though\nthey tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions, thought only\nof what was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches\nappearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemy’s troops. The\nweather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly\nupon the Danube and the dark hills around it. It was calm, and at intervals\nthe bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill.\nThere was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few\nscattered skirmishers. An empty space of some seven hundred yards was all\nthat separated them. The enemy ceased firing, and that stern, threatening,\ninaccessible, and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all\nthe more clearly felt.\n“One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing\nthe living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death.

The officers\nwho had been standing together rode off to their places. The hussars began\ncarefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole squadron. All were\nlooking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander, awaiting the\nword of command. A second and a third cannon ball flew past. Evidently\nthey were firing at the hussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle\nflew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them. The\nhussars did not look round, but at the sound of each shot, as at the word of\ncommand, the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so\ndifferent, holding its breath while the ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and\nsank back again. The soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one\nanother, curious to see their comrades’ impression. Every face, from\nDenísov’s to that of the bugler, showed one common expression of conflict,\nirritation, and excitement, around chin and mouth. The quartermaster\nfrowned, looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them. Cadet\nMirónov ducked every time a ball flew past. Rostóv on the left flank,\nmounted on his Rook—a handsome horse despite its game leg—had the\nhappy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an\nexamination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself. He was\nglancing at everyone with a clear, bright expression, as if asking them to\nnotice how calmly he sat under fire. But despite himself, on his face too that\nsame indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth.\n“Who’s that curtseying there? Cadet Miwónov! That’s not wight! Look at\nme,” cried Denísov who, unable to keep still on one spot, kept turning his\nhorse in front of the squadron.\nThe black, hairy, snub-nosed face of Váska Denísov, and his whole short\nsturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he\nheld the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually did, especially\ntoward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he was only redder\nthan usual.

He rode up to Kírsten. The staff captain on his broad-backed,\nsteady mare came at a walk to meet him. His face with its long mustache\nwas serious as always, only his eyes were brighter than usual.\n“Well, what about it?” said he to Denísov. “It won’t come to a fight.\nYou’ll see—we shall retire.”\n“The devil only knows what they’re about!” muttered Denísov. “Ah,\nWostóv,” he cried noticing the cadet’s bright face, “you’ve got it at last.”\nAnd he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet. Rostóv felt\nperfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge. Denísov\ngalloped up to him.\n“Your excellency! Let us attack them! I’ll dwive them off.”\n“Attack indeed!” said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his face\nas if driving off a troublesome fly. “And why are you stopping here? Don’t\nyou see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron back.”\nThe squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without\nhaving lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front\nline followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side of\nthe river.\nThe two Pávlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the\nhill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogdánich Schubert, came up to\nDenísov’s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostóv, without\ntaking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time\nsince their encounter concerning Telyánin. Rostóv, feeling that he was at the\nfront and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had\nbeen to blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonel’s athletic back, his nape\ncovered with light hair, and his red neck. It seemed to Rostóv that\nBogdánich was only pretending not to notice him, and that his whole aim\nnow was to test the cadet’s courage, so he drew himself up and looked\naround him merrily; then it seemed to him that Bogdánich rode so near in\norder to show him his courage. Next he thought that his enemy would send\nthe squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him—Rostóv. Then he\nimagined how, after the attack, Bogdánich would come up to him as he lay\nwounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation."}, {"page": 210, "text": "The high-shouldered figure of Zherkóv, familiar to the Pávlograds as he\nhad but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel. After his\ndismissal from headquarters Zherkóv had not remained in the regiment,\nsaying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get\nmore rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded in attaching\nhimself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagratión. He now came to his\nformer chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard.\n“Colonel,” he said, addressing Rostóv’s enemy with an air of gloomy\ngravity and glancing round at his comrades, “there is an order to stop and\nfire the bridge.”\n“An order to who?” asked the colonel morosely.\n“I don’t myself know ‘to who,’” replied the cornet in a serious tone, “but\nthe prince told me to ‘go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return\nquickly and fire the bridge.’”\nZherkóv was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the\ncolonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout Nesvítski came\ngalloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight.\n“How’s this, Colonel?” he shouted as he approached. “I told you to fire\nthe bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all beside\nthemselves over there and one can’t make anything out.”\nThe colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvítski.\n“You spoke to me of inflammable material,” said he, “but you said\nnothing about firing it.”\n“But, my dear sir,” said Nesvítski as he drew up, taking off his cap and\nsmoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand, “wasn’t I\ntelling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material had been put in\nposition?”\n“I am not your ‘dear sir,’ Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell me to\nburn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders strictly to\nobey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would burn it, I could\nnot know by the holy spirit!”\n“Ah, that’s always the way!” said Nesvítski with a wave of the hand.\n“How did you get here?” said he, turning to Zherkóv.\n“On the same business. But you are damp!

Rostóv watched his enemy,\nthe colonel, closely—to find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture,\nbut the colonel did not once glance at Rostóv, and looked as he always did\nwhen at the front, solemn and stern. Then came the word of command.\n“Look sharp! Look sharp!” several voices repeated around him.\nTheir sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the hussars\nhastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The men were\ncrossing themselves. Rostóv no longer looked at the colonel, he had no\ntime. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid that his\nheart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly’s\ncharge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud. Denísov rode past\nhim, leaning back and shouting something. Rostóv saw nothing but the\nhussars running all around him, their spurs catching and their sabers\nclattering.\n“Stretchers!” shouted someone behind him.\nRostóv did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on, trying\nonly to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not looking at the\nground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled, and fell on his\nhands. The others outstripped him."}, {"page": 212, "text": "“At boss zides, Captain,” he heard the voice of the colonel, who, having\nridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a triumphant,\ncheerful face.\nRostóv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and\nwas about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front the better.\nBut Bogdánich, without looking at or recognizing Rostóv, shouted to him:\n“Who’s that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come\nback, Cadet!” he cried angrily; and turning to Denísov, who, showing off\nhis courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:\n“Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount,” he said.\n“Oh, every bullet has its billet,” answered Váska Denísov, turning in his\nsaddle.\nMeanwhile Nesvítski, Zherkóv, and the officer of the suite were standing\ntogether out of range of the shots, watching, now the small group of men\nwith yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord, and blue riding\nbreeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at what was\napproaching in the distance from the opposite side—the blue uniforms and\ngroups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.\n“Will they burn the bridge or not? Who’ll get there first? Will they get\nthere and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range and\nwipe them out?” These were the questions each man of the troops on the\nhigh ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking\nheart—watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and\nthe blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns.\n“Ugh. The hussars will get it hot!” said Nesvítski; “they are within\ngrapeshot range now.”\n“He shouldn’t have taken so many men,” said the officer of the suite.\n“True enough,” answered Nesvítski; “two smart fellows could have done\nthe job just as well.”\n“Ah, your excellency,” put in Zherkóv, his eyes fixed on the hussars, but\nstill with that naïve air that made it impossible to know whether he was\nspeaking in jest or in earnest. “Ah, your excellency!

But now, even if they do get peppered, the squadron may be"}, {"page": 213, "text": "recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon. Our Bogdánich knows\nhow things are done.”\n“There now!” said the officer of the suite, “that’s grapeshot.”\nHe pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached\nand hurriedly removed.\nOn the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke\nappeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at the\nmoment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two reports\none after another, and a third.\n“Oh! Oh!” groaned Nesvítski as if in fierce pain, seizing the officer of the\nsuite by the arm. “Look! A man has fallen! Fallen, fallen!”\n“Two, I think.”\n“If I were Tsar I would never go to war,” said Nesvítski, turning away.\nThe French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue\nuniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again but at\nirregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge. But\nthis time Nesvítski could not see what was happening there, as a dense\ncloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire\nand the French batteries were now firing at them, no longer to hinder them\nbut because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at.\nThe French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars\ngot back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot went too high,\nbut the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three\nof them over.\nRostóv, absorbed by his relations with Bogdánich, had paused on the\nbridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he had\nalways imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the bridge\nbecause he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other\nsoldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a rattle on\nthe bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest to him fell\nagainst the rails with a groan. Rostóv ran up to him with the others. Again\nsomeone shouted, “Stretchers!” Four men seized the hussar and began\nlifting him.\n“Oooh! For Christ’s sake let me alone!” cried the wounded man, but still\nhe was lifted and laid on the stretcher."}, {"page": 214, "text": "Nicholas Rostóv turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed\ninto the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the sun.\nHow beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, and how deep!

And fairer still were the faraway blue mountains\nbeyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and the pine forests\nveiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace and happiness... “I\nshould wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I were there,” thought Rostóv.\n“In myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness; but here...\ngroans, suffering, fear, and this uncertainty and hurry... There—they are\nshouting again, and again are all running back somewhere, and I shall run\nwith them, and it, death, is here above me and around...

And the fear of death and of the\nstretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one feeling of\nsickening agitation.\n“O Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect\nme!” Rostóv whispered.\nThe hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices\nsounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.\n“Well, fwiend? So you’ve smelt powdah!” shouted Váska Denísov just\nabove his ear.\n“It’s all over; but I am a coward—yes, a coward!” thought Rostóv, and\nsighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting one foot, from\nthe orderly and began to mount.\n“Was that grapeshot?” he asked Denísov.\n“Yes and no mistake!” cried Denísov. “You worked like wegular bwicks\nand it’s nasty work!

There\nhad been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the courage\nand endurance—acknowledged even by the enemy—with which the\nRussians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more\nrapid retreat. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had\njoined Kutúzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and\nKutúzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces. The\ndefense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead of an offensive,\nthe plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of\nstrategics, had been handed to Kutúzov when he was in Vienna by the\nAustrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for\nhim was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from\nRussia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.\nOn the twenty-eighth of October Kutúzov with his army crossed to the\nleft bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time with the\nriver between himself and the main body of the French. On the thirtieth he\nattacked Mortier’s division, which was on the left bank, and broke it up. In\nthis action for the first time trophies were taken: banners, cannon, and two\nenemy generals. For the first time, after a fortnight’s retreat, the Russian\ntroops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had\nrepulsed the French.

His horse had been\nwounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark\nof the commander in chief’s special favor he was sent with the news of this\nvictory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was\nthreatened by the French) but at Brünn. Despite his apparently delicate\nbuild Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many\nvery muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived at Krems\nexcited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokhtúrov to Kutúzov, he was\nsent immediately with a special dispatch to Brünn. To be so sent meant not\nonly a reward but an important step toward promotion.\nThe night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that had\nfallen the previous day—the day of the battle.

As soon as he closed his eyes his\nears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory.\nThen he began to imagine that the Russians were running away and that he\nhimself was killed, but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if\nlearning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the French had\nrun away. He again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm\ncourage during the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... The dark\nstarry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning.

Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three\ngold pieces.\n“That’s for them all,” he said to the officer who came up.\n“Get well soon, lads!” he continued, turning to the soldiers. “There’s\nplenty to do still.”\n“What news, sir?” asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a\nconversation.\n“Good news!...

Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night, Prince Andrew when he\ndrove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done\nthe day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed\none another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity. He again vividly\nrecalled the details of the battle, no longer dim, but definite and in the\nconcise form in which he imagined himself stating them to the Emperor\nFrancis. He vividly imagined the casual questions that might be put to him\nand the answers he would give. He expected to be at once presented to the\nEmperor. At the chief entrance to the palace, however, an official came\nrunning out to meet him, and learning that he was a special messenger led\nhim to another entrance.\n“To the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren!

He felt offended, and without\nhis noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain\nwhich was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly suggested to him a\npoint of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the\nminister. “Away from the smell of powder, they probably think it easy to\ngain victories!” he thought. His eyes narrowed disdainfully, he entered the\nroom of the Minister of War with peculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of\ndisdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table\nreading some papers and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two\nor three minutes taking no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each\nside of the minister’s bent bald head with its gray temples. He went on\nreading to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and\nthe sound of footsteps.\n“Take this and deliver it,” said he to his adjutant, handing him the papers\nand still taking no notice of the special messenger.\nPrince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutúzov’s army interested\nthe Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was concerned\nwith, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that impression.\n“But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me,” he thought. The minister\ndrew the remaining papers together, arranged them evenly, and then raised\nhis head. He had an intellectual and distinctive head, but the instant he\nturned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent expression on his face changed\nin a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him. His face took on the\nstupid artificial smile (which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality)\nof a man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another.\n“From General Field Marshal Kutúzov?” he asked. “I hope it is good\nnews?

But Mortier is not\ncaptured.” Again he pondered. “I am very glad you have brought good\nnews, though Schmidt’s death is a heavy price to pay for the victory. His\nMajesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I thank you! You must\nhave a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade. However, I will let\nyou know.”\nThe stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking,\nreappeared.\n“Au revoir! Thank you very much.

He was not one of those many diplomats who"}, {"page": 222, "text": "are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities, avoid doing\ncertain things, and speak French. He was one of those, who, liking work,\nknew how to do it, and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a\nwhole night at his writing table. He worked well whatever the import of his\nwork. It was not the question “What for?” but the question “How?” that\ninterested him. What the diplomatic matter might be he did not care, but it\ngave him great pleasure to prepare a circular, memorandum, or report,\nskillfully, pointedly, and elegantly. Bilíbin’s services were valued not only\nfor what he wrote, but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those\nin the highest spheres.\nBilíbin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be made\nelegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to say\nsomething striking and took part in a conversation only when that was\npossible. His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original,\nfinished phrases of general interest. These sayings were prepared in the\ninner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so that\ninsignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to\ndrawing room. And, in fact, Bilíbin’s witticisms were hawked about in the\nViennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered\nimportant.\nHis thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which\nalways looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one’s fingers after a\nRussian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of\nexpression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and\nhis eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and deep\nwrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always twinkled\nand looked out straight.\n“Well, now tell me about your exploits,” said he.\nBolkónski, very modestly without once mentioning himself, described\nthe engagement and his reception by the Minister of War.\n“They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of\nskittles,” said he in conclusion.\nBilíbin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.\n“Cependant, mon cher,” he remarked, examining his nails from a\ndistance and puckering the skin above his left eye, “malgré la haute estime"}, {"page": 223, "text": "que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army, j’avoue que votre victoire\nn’est pas des plus victorieuses.” *\n* “But my dear fellow, with all my respect for the Orthodox Russian army, I\nmust say that your victory was not particularly victorious.”\nHe went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in\nRussian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.\n“Come now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier and\nhis one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers! Where’s\nthe victory?”\n“But seriously,” said Prince Andrew, “we can at any rate say without\nboasting that it was a little better than at Ulm...”\n“Why didn’t you capture one, just one, marshal for us?”\n“Because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness\nof a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by seven in\nthe morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon.”\n“And why didn’t you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have\nbeen there at seven in the morning,” returned Bilíbin with a smile. “You\nought to have been there at seven in the morning.”\n“Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic\nmethods that he had better leave Genoa alone?” retorted Prince Andrew in\nthe same tone.\n“I know,” interrupted Bilíbin, “you’re thinking it’s very easy to take\nmarshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but still why didn’t you\ncapture him? So don’t be surprised if not only the Minister of War but also\nhis Most August Majesty the Emperor and King Francis is not much\ndelighted by your victory. Even I, a poor secretary of the Russian Embassy,\ndo not feel any need in token of my joy to give my Franz a thaler, or let him\ngo with his Liebchen to the Prater... True, we have no Prater here...”\nHe looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his\nforehead.\n“It is now my turn to ask you ‘why?’ mon cher,” said Bolkónski. “I\nconfess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here\nbeyond my feeble intelligence, but I can’t make it out. Mack loses a whole\narmy, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl give no signs of life"}, {"page": 224, "text": "and make blunder after blunder. Kutúzov alone at last gains a real victory,\ndestroying the spell of the invincibility of the French, and the Minister of\nWar does not even care to hear the details.”\n“That’s just it, my dear fellow. You see it’s hurrah for the Tsar, for\nRussia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but what do we, I\nmean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring us nice news of a\nvictory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one archduke’s as good as\nanother, as you know) and even if it is only over a fire brigade of\nBonaparte’s, that will be another story and we’ll fire off some cannon! But\nthis sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does\nnothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna,\ngive up its defense—as much as to say: ‘Heaven is with us, but heaven help\nyou and your capital!’ The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you\nexpose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit that\nmore irritating news than yours could not have been conceived. It’s as if it\nhad been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose you did gain a\nbrilliant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a victory, what effect\nwould that have on the general course of events? It’s too late now when\nVienna is occupied by the French army!”\n“What? Occupied? Vienna occupied?”\n“Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Schönbrunn, and the count, our\ndear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.”\nAfter the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and\nespecially after having dined, Bolkónski felt that he could not take in the\nfull significance of the words he heard.\n“Count Lichtenfels was here this morning,” Bilíbin continued, “and\nshowed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna was fully\ndescribed: Prince Murat et tout le tremblement... You see that your victory is\nnot a matter for great rejoicing and that you can’t be received as a savior.”\n“Really I don’t care about that, I don’t care at all,” said Prince Andrew,\nbeginning to understand that his news of the battle before Krems was really\nof small importance in view of such events as the fall of Austria’s capital.\n“How is it Vienna was taken? What of the bridge and its celebrated\nbridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard reports that Prince Auersperg\nwas defending Vienna?” he said."}, {"page": 225, "text": "“Prince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is defending us\n—doing it very badly, I think, but still he is defending us. But Vienna is on\nthe other side. No, the bridge has not yet been taken and I hope it will not\nbe, for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up. Otherwise we\nshould long ago have been in the mountains of Bohemia, and you and your\narmy would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires.”\n“But still this does not mean that the campaign is over,” said Prince\nAndrew.\n“Well, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, but they daren’t say so.\nIt will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign, it won’t be your\nskirmishing at Dürrenstein, or gunpowder at all, that will decide the matter,\nbut those who devised it,” said Bilíbin quoting one of his own mots,\nreleasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and pausing. “The only question is\nwhat will come of the meeting between the Emperor Alexander and the\nKing of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia joins the Allies, Austria’s hand will be\nforced and there will be war. If not it is merely a question of settling where\nthe preliminaries of the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.”\n“What an extraordinary genius!” Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed,\nclenching his small hand and striking the table with it, “and what luck the\nman has!”\n“Buonaparte?” said Bilíbin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead to\nindicate that he was about to say something witty. “Buonaparte?” he\nrepeated, accentuating the u: “I think, however, now that he lays down laws\nfor Austria at Schönbrunn, il faut lui faire grâce de l’u! * I shall certainly\nadopt an innovation and call him simply Bonaparte!”\n* “We must let him off the u!”\n“But joking apart,” said Prince Andrew, “do you really think the\ncampaign is over?”\n“This is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is not used\nto it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the first place because\nher provinces have been pillaged—they say the Holy Russian army loots\nterribly—her army is destroyed, her capital taken, and all this for the beaux\nyeux * of His Sardinian Majesty.

Recalling his recent impressions, the first thought\nthat came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the\nEmperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite Austrian\nadjutant, Bilíbin, and last night’s conversation. Having dressed for his\nattendance at court in full parade uniform, which he had not worn for a long\ntime, he went into Bilíbin’s study fresh, animated, and handsome, with his\nhand bandaged. In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps.\nWith Prince Hippolyte Kurágin, who was a secretary to the embassy,\nBolkónski was already acquainted. Bilíbin introduced him to the others.\nThe gentlemen assembled at Bilíbin’s were young, wealthy, gay society\nmen, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which Bilíbin, their\nleader, called les nôtres. * This set, consisting almost exclusively of\ndiplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war\nor politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to the official\nside of the service. These gentlemen received Prince Andrew as one of\nthemselves, an honor they did not extend to many. From politeness and to\nstart conversation, they asked him a few questions about the army and the\nbattle, and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip.\n* Ours.\n“But the best of it was,” said one, telling of the misfortune of a fellow\ndiplomat, “that the Chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to\nLondon was a promotion and that he was so to regard it. Can you fancy the\nfigure he cut?...”\n“But the worst of it, gentlemen—I am giving Kurágin away to you—is\nthat that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is taking advantage\nof it!”\nPrince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its arm.\nHe began to laugh."}, {"page": 228, "text": "“Tell me about that!” he said.\n“Oh, you Don Juan! You serpent!” cried several voices.\n“You, Bolkónski, don’t know,” said Bilíbin turning to Prince Andrew,\n“that all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of the Russian\narmy) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the\nwomen!”\n“La femme est la compagne de l’homme,” * announced Prince\nHippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.\n* “Woman is man’s companion.”\nBilíbin and the rest of “ours” burst out laughing in Hippolyte’s face, and\nPrince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whom—he had to admit—he had\nalmost been jealous on his wife’s account, was the butt of this set.\n“Oh, I must give you a treat,” Bilíbin whispered to Bolkónski. “Kurágin\nis exquisite when he discusses politics—you should see his gravity!”\nHe sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking\nto him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these\ntwo.\n“The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance,” began\nHippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, “without\nexpressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless His\nMajesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance...\n“Wait, I have not finished...” he said to Prince Andrew, seizing him by\nthe arm, “I believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention.\nAnd...” he paused. “Finally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our\ndispatch of November 18. That is how it will end.” And he released\nBolkónski’s arm to indicate that he had now quite finished.\n“Demosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden\nmouth!” said Bilíbin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with\nsatisfaction.\nEverybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was evidently\ndistressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild laughter\nthat convulsed his usually impassive features.\n“Well now, gentlemen,” said Bilíbin, “Bolkónski is my guest in this\nhouse and in Brünn itself.

Oh! Oh!”\n“Well, au revoir, Bolkónski! Au revoir, Prince! Come back early to\ndinner,” cried several voices. “We’ll take you in hand.”\n“When speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way\nthat provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,” said Bilíbin,\naccompanying him to the hall.\n“I should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts, I\ncan’t,” replied Bolkónski, smiling.\n“Well, talk as much as you can, anyway.

But after it was over, the\nadjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed Bolkónski\nthat the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor Francis\nreceived him standing in the middle of the room. Before the conversation\nbegan Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed\nconfused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.\n“Tell me, when did the battle begin?” he asked hurriedly.\nPrince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple:\n“Was Kutúzov well? When had he left Krems?” and so on. The Emperor\nspoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions—the\nanswers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest him.\n“At what o’clock did the battle begin?” asked the Emperor.\n“I cannot inform Your Majesty at what o’clock the battle began at the\nfront, but at Dürrenstein, where I was, our attack began after five in the\nafternoon,” replied Bolkónski growing more animated and expecting that he\nwould have a chance to give a reliable account, which he had ready in his\nmind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor smiled and interrupted\nhim.\n“How many miles?”\n“From where to where, Your Majesty?”\n“From Dürrenstein to Krems.”\n“Three and a half miles, Your Majesty.”\n“The French have abandoned the left bank?”\n“According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the\nnight.”"}, {"page": 231, "text": "“Is there sufficient forage in Krems?”\n“Forage has not been supplied to the extent...”\nThe Emperor interrupted him.\n“At what o’clock was General Schmidt killed?”\n“At seven o’clock, I believe.”\n“At seven o’clock? It’s very sad, very sad!”\nThe Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew\nwithdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides.\nEverywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday’s\nadjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered\nhim his own house. The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on\nthe Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was\nconferring on him. The Empress’ chamberlain invited him to see Her\nMajesty. The archduchess also wished to see him. He did not know whom\nto answer, and for a few seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian\nambassador took him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to\ntalk to him.\nContrary to Bilíbin’s forecast the news he had brought was joyfully\nreceived. A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kutúzov was awarded the\nGrand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards.\nBolkónski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning\ncalling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between four and five in the\nafternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to Bilíbin’s house\nthinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to Brünn. At\nthe door he found a vehicle half full of luggage. Franz, Bilíbin’s man, was\ndragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door.\nBefore returning to Bilíbin’s Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop to\nprovide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some\ntime in the shop.\n“What is it?” he asked.\n“Oh, your excellency!” said Franz, with difficulty rolling the\nportmanteau into the vehicle, “we are to move on still farther. The scoundrel\nis again at our heels!”\n“Eh? What?” asked Prince Andrew."}, {"page": 232, "text": "Bilíbin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.\n“There now! Confess that this is delightful,” said he. “This affair of the\nThabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without striking a blow!”\nPrince Andrew could not understand.\n“But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the\ntown knows?”\n“I come from the archduchess’. I heard nothing there.”\n“And you didn’t see that everybody is packing up?”\n“I did not... What is it all about?” inquired Prince Andrew impatiently.\n“What’s it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that\nAuersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat is\nnow rushing along the road to Brünn and will be here in a day or two.”\n“What? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was mined?”\n“That is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.”\nBolkónski shrugged his shoulders.\n“But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It will be\ncut off,” said he.\n“That’s just it,” answered Bilíbin. “Listen! The French entered Vienna as\nI told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those gentlemen,\nmessieurs les maréchaux, * Murat, Lannes, and Belliard, mount and ride to\nthe bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.) ‘Gentlemen,’ says one of\nthem, ‘you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and doubly mined and that\nthere are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand\nmen has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross? But it will\nplease our sovereign the Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us\nthree go and take it!’ ‘Yes, let’s!’ say the others. And off they go and take\nthe bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the\nDanube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication.”\n* The marshalls.\n“Stop jesting,” said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news\ngrieved him and yet he was pleased.\nAs soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless\nsituation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of"}, {"page": 233, "text": "this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from the ranks of\nobscure officers and offer him the first step to fame! Listening to Bilíbin he\nwas already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion\nat the war council which would be the only one that could save the army,\nand how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan.\n“Stop this jesting,” he said.\n“I am not jesting,” Bilíbin went on. “Nothing is truer or sadder. These\ngentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs; they\nassure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on their way to\nnegotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the tête-de-pont. * They\nspin him a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is over, that the\nEmperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte, that they desire to\nsee Prince Auersperg, and so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these\ngentlemen embrace the officers, crack jokes, sit on the cannon, and\nmeanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved, flings the bags\nof incendiary material into the water, and approaches the tête-de-pont. At\nlength appears the lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von\nMautern himself. ‘Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the\nTurkish wars! Hostilities are ended, we can shake one another’s hand.... The\nEmperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auersperg’s\nacquaintance.’ In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so bewildered\nhim with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly established\nintimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the sight of Murat’s\nmantle and ostrich plumes, qu’il n’y voit que du feu, et oublie celui qu’il\ndevait faire faire sur l’ennemi!” *(2) In spite of the animation of his speech,\nBilíbin did not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due\nappreciation. “The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the\nguns, and the bridge is taken! But what is best of all,” he went on, his\nexcitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, “is that\nthe sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the\nmines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French troops\nwere running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes stayed his hand.\nThe sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general, goes up to\nAuersperg and says: ‘Prince, you are being deceived, here are the French!’\nMurat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak, turns to\nAuersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says: ‘I\ndon’t recognize the world-famous Austrian discipline, if you allow a"}, {"page": 234, "text": "subordinate to address you like that!’ It was a stroke of genius.

That puts the court in too bad a light,” replied Bilíbin.\n“It’s not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is just as at Ulm... it is...”—\nhe seemed to be trying to find the right expression. “C’est... c’est du Mack.\nNous sommes mackés (It is... it is a bit of Mack. We are Macked),” he\nconcluded, feeling that he had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that\nwould be repeated. His hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of\npleasure, and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails.\n“Where are you off to?” he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had\nrisen and was going toward his room.\n“I am going away.”\n“Where to?”\n“To the army.”\n“But you meant to stay another two days?”\n“But now I am off at once.”\nAnd Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to\nhis room.\n“Do you know, mon cher,” said Bilíbin following him, “I have been\nthinking about you. Why are you going?”\nAnd in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles\nvanished from his face.\nPrince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.\n“Why are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to the\narmy now that it is in danger. I understand that.

Near Hetzelsdorf Prince\nAndrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving\nwith great haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was so obstructed\nwith carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage. Prince Andrew took\na horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and weary,\nmaking his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the commander\nin chief and of his own luggage. Very sinister reports of the position of the\narmy reached him as he went along, and the appearance of the troops in\ntheir disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.\n“Cette armée russe que l’or de l’Angleterre a transportée des extrémités\nde l’univers, nous allons lui faire éprouver le même sort—(le sort de\nl’armée d’Ulm).” * He remembered these words in Bonaparte’s address to\nhis army at the beginning of the campaign, and they awoke in him\nastonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling of wounded pride, and a\nhope of glory. “And should there be nothing left but to die?” he thought.\n“Well, if need be, I shall do it no worse than others.”\n* “That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth by\nEnglish gold, we shall cause to share the same fate—(the fate of the army at\nUlm).”\nHe looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments,\ncarts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds\novertaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and sometimes\nfour abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear could reach,\nthere were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts and gun carriages, the"}, {"page": 237, "text": "tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the urging of horses, and the\nswearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers. All along the sides of the road\nfallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some not, and broken-down\ncarts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something, and again\nsoldiers straggling from their companies, crowds of whom set off to the\nneighboring villages, or returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and\nbulging sacks. At each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet\ndenser and the din of shouting more incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-\ndeep in mud pushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs\nslipped, traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers\ndirecting the march rode backward and forward between the carts. Their\nvoices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces\nthat they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder.\n“Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army,” thought Bolkónski, recalling\nBilíbin’s words.\nWishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to a\nconvoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle,\nevidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking\nlike something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a calèche. A soldier was\ndriving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the\nleather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting his\nquestion to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate\nshrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An officer in charge of transport was\nbeating the soldier who was driving the woman’s vehicle for trying to get\nahead of others, and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the\nequipage. The woman screamed piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she\nleaned out from behind the apron and, waving her thin arms from under the\nwoolen shawl, cried:\n“Mr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heaven’s sake... Protect\nme! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh\nChasseurs.... They won’t let us pass, we are left behind and have lost our\npeople...”\n“I’ll flatten you into a pancake!” shouted the angry officer to the soldier.\n“Turn back with your slut!”\n“Mr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?” screamed the\ndoctor’s wife."}, {"page": 238, "text": "“Kindly let this cart pass. Don’t you see it’s a woman?” said Prince\nAndrew riding up to the officer.\nThe officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the\nsoldier. “I’ll teach you to push on!... Back!”\n“Let them pass, I tell you!” repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his\nlips.\n“And who are you?” cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy rage,\n“who are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander here, not\nyou! Go back or I’ll flatten you into a pancake,” repeated he. This\nexpression evidently pleased him.\n“That was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp,” came a voice from\nbehind.\nPrince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless, tipsy\nrage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his\nchampionship of the doctor’s wife in her queer trap might expose him to\nwhat he dreaded more than anything in the world—to ridicule; but his\ninstinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence Prince\nAndrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised his riding\nwhip.\n“Kind...ly let—them—pass!”\nThe officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.\n“It’s all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there’s this disorder,”\nhe muttered. “Do as you like.”\nPrince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the\ndoctor’s wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with a sense\nof disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to\nthe village where he was told who the commander in chief was.\nOn reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house,\nintending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort out the\nstinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind. “This is a mob of\nscoundrels and not an army,” he was thinking as he went up to the window\nof the first house, when a familiar voice called him by name.\nHe turned round. Nesvítski’s handsome face looked out of the little\nwindow. Nesvítski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and\nflourishing his arm, called him to enter."}, {"page": 239, "text": "“Bolkónski! Bolkónski!... Don’t you hear? Eh? Come quick...” he\nshouted.\nEntering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesvítski and another adjutant\nhaving something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he had\nany news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm. This was\nparticularly noticeable on Nesvítski’s usually laughing countenance.\n“Where is the commander in chief?” asked Bolkónski.\n“Here, in that house,” answered the adjutant.\n“Well, is it true that it’s peace and capitulation?” asked Nesvítski.\n“I was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I could do\nto get here.”\n“And we, my dear boy! It’s terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack, we’re\ngetting it still worse,” said Nesvítski. “But sit down and have something to\neat.”\n“You won’t be able to find either your baggage or anything else now,\nPrince. And God only knows where your man Peter is,” said the other\nadjutant.\n“Where are headquarters?”\n“We are to spend the night in Znaim.”\n“Well, I have got all I need into packs for two horses,” said Nesvítski.\n“They’ve made up splendid packs for me—fit to cross the Bohemian\nmountains with. It’s a bad lookout, old fellow! But what’s the matter with\nyou? You must be ill to shiver like that,” he added, noticing that Prince\nAndrew winced as at an electric shock.\n“It’s nothing,” replied Prince Andrew.\nHe had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor’s wife and\nthe convoy officer.\n“What is the commander in chief doing here?” he asked.\n“I can’t make out at all,” said Nesvítski.\n“Well, all I can make out is that everything is abominable, abominable,\nquite abominable!” said Prince Andrew, and he went off to the house where\nthe commander in chief was.\nPassing by Kutúzov’s carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his\nsuite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince Andrew"}, {"page": 240, "text": "entered the passage. Kutúzov himself, he was told, was in the house with\nPrince Bagratión and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian general who\nhad succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little Kozlóvski was squatting on his\nheels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned up, was hastily writing\nat a tub turned bottom upwards. Kozlóvski’s face looked worn—he too had\nevidently not slept all night. He glanced at Prince Andrew and did not even\nnod to him.\n“Second line... have you written it?” he continued dictating to the clerk.\n“The Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...”\n“One can’t write so fast, your honor,” said the clerk, glancing angrily and\ndisrespectfully at Kozlóvski.\nThrough the door came the sounds of Kutúzov’s voice, excited and\ndissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the sound of\nthese voices, the inattentive way Kozlóvski looked at him, the disrespectful\nmanner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and Kozlóvski were\nsquatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief, and from\nthe noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the horses near the window,\nPrince Andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to\nhappen.\nHe turned to Kozlóvski with urgent questions.\n“Immediately, Prince,” said Kozlóvski. “Dispositions for Bagratión.”\n“What about capitulation?”\n“Nothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle.”\nPrince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard.\nJust as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, and\nKutúzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway. Prince\nAndrew stood right in front of Kutúzov but the expression of the\ncommander in chief’s one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with\nthoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He looked straight\nat his adjutant’s face without recognizing him.\n“Well, have you finished?” said he to Kozlóvski.\n“One moment, your excellency.”\nBagratión, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm,\nimpassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief."}, {"page": 241, "text": "“I have the honor to present myself,” repeated Prince Andrew rather\nloudly, handing Kutúzov an envelope.\n“Ah, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!”\nKutúzov went out into the porch with Bagratión.\n“Well, good-by, Prince,” said he to Bagratión. “My blessing, and may\nChrist be with you in your great endeavor!”\nHis face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left\nhand he drew Bagratión toward him, and with his right, on which he wore a\nring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently\nhabitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagratión kissed him on the neck\ninstead.\n“Christ be with you!” Kutúzov repeated and went toward his carriage.\n“Get in with me,” said he to Bolkónski.\n“Your excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to remain\nwith Prince Bagratión’s detachment.”\n“Get in,” said Kutúzov, and noticing that Bolkónski still delayed, he\nadded: “I need good officers myself, need them myself!”\nThey got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.\n“There is still much, much before us,” he said, as if with an old man’s\npenetration he understood all that was passing in Bolkónski’s mind. “If a\ntenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,” he added as if\nspeaking to himself.\nPrince Andrew glanced at Kutúzov’s face only a foot distant from him\nand involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his\ntemple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty eye\nsocket. “Yes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those men’s death,”\nthought Bolkónski.\n“That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment,” he said.\nKutúzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been\nsaying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying on\nthe soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew. There was not a\ntrace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he questioned Prince\nAndrew about the details of his interview with the Emperor, about the"}, {"page": 242, "text": "remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems affair, and about some\nladies they both knew."}, {"page": 243, "text": "CHAPTER XIV\nOn November 1 Kutúzov had received, through a spy, news that the army\nhe commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported that\nthe French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in immense\nforce upon Kutúzov’s line of communication with the troops that were\narriving from Russia. If Kutúzov decided to remain at Krems, Napoleon’s\narmy of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely\nand surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he would find\nhimself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If Kutúzov decided to abandon the\nroad connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia, he would have to\nmarch with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains,\ndefending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all\nhope of a junction with Buxhöwden. If Kutúzov decided to retreat along the\nroad from Krems to Olmütz, to unite with the troops arriving from Russia,\nhe risked being forestalled on that road by the French who had crossed the\nVienna bridge, and encumbered by his baggage and transport, having to\naccept battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong, who\nwould hem him in from two sides.\nKutúzov chose this latter course.\nThe French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were\nadvancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles off\non the line of Kutúzov’s retreat. If he reached Znaim before the French,\nthere would be great hope of saving the army; to let the French forestall him\nat Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of\nUlm, or to utter destruction. But to forestall the French with his whole army\nwas impossible. The road for the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter\nand better than the road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim.\nThe night he received the news, Kutúzov sent Bagratión’s vanguard, four\nthousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim to the\nVienna-Znaim road. Bagratión was to make this march without resting, and"}, {"page": 244, "text": "to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he succeeded in\nforestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible. Kutúzov\nhimself with all his transport took the road to Znaim.\nMarching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his\nhungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the\nway, Bagratión came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabrünn a few\nhours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrünn from Vienna.\nKutúzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could\nreach Znaim. Hence Bagratión with his four thousand hungry, exhausted\nmen would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon\nhim at Hollabrünn, which was clearly impossible. But a freak of fate made\nthe impossible possible. The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna\nbridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat to try to deceive\nKutúzov in a similar way. Meeting Bagratión’s weak detachment on the\nZnaim road he supposed it to be Kutúzov’s whole army. To be able to crush\nit absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on\ntheir way from Vienna, and with this object offered a three days’ truce on\ncondition that both armies should remain in position without moving. Murat\ndeclared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he\ntherefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count Nostitz,\nthe Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed Murat’s\nemissary and retired, leaving Bagratión’s division exposed. Another\nemissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to\noffer the Russian army the three days’ truce. Bagratión replied that he was\nnot authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to\nKutúzov to report the offer he had received.\nA truce was Kutúzov’s sole chance of gaining time, giving Bagratión’s\nexhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and heavy convoys\n(whose movements were concealed from the French) advance if but one\nstage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only, and a quite\nunexpected, chance of saving the army. On receiving the news he\nimmediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in\nattendance on him, to the enemy camp. Wintzingerode was not merely to\nagree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and meanwhile\nKutúzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of\nthe baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim road.\nBagratión’s exhausted and hungry detachment, which alone covered this"}, {"page": 245, "text": "movement of the transport and of the whole army, had to remain stationary\nin face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself.\nKutúzov’s expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were in\nno way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass, and also\nthat Murat’s mistake would very soon be discovered, proved correct. As\nsoon as Bonaparte (who was at Schönbrunn, sixteen miles from\nHollabrünn) received Murat’s dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a\ncapitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to Murat:\nSchönbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,\nat eight o’clock in the morning\nTo PRINCE MURAT,\nI cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command only\nmy advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my\norder. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break the\narmistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the general\nwho signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no one but the\nEmperor of Russia has that right.\nIf, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will ratify\nit; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian army.... You are in a\nposition to seize its baggage and artillery.\nThe Russian Emperor’s aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are nothing\nwhen they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrians let\nthemselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are letting\nyourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor.\nNAPOLEON\nBonaparte’s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to Murat.\nBonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all the Guards\nto the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim escape, and Bagratión’s\nfour thousand men merrily lighted campfires, dried and warmed\nthemselves, cooked their porridge for the first time for three days, and not\none of them knew or imagined what was in store for him."}, {"page": 246, "text": "CHAPTER XV\nBetween three and four o’clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who had\npersisted in his request to Kutúzov, arrived at Grunth and reported himself\nto Bagratión. Bonaparte’s adjutant had not yet reached Murat’s detachment\nand the battle had not yet begun. In Bagratión’s detachment no one knew\nanything of the general position of affairs. They talked of peace but did not\nbelieve in its possibility; others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the\nnearness of an engagement. Bagratión, knowing Bolkónski to be a favorite\nand trusted adjutant, received him with distinction and special marks of\nfavor, explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that\nday or the next, and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the\nbattle or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat,\n“which is also very important.”\n“However, there will hardly be an engagement today,” said Bagratión as\nif to reassure Prince Andrew.\n“If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he\ncan get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he wishes to stay with\nme, let him... he’ll be of use here if he’s a brave officer,” thought Bagratión.\nPrince Andrew, without replying, asked the prince’s permission to ride\nround the position to see the disposition of the forces, so as to know his\nbearings should he be sent to execute an order. The officer on duty, a\nhandsome, elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger,\nwho was fond of speaking French though he spoke it badly, offered to\nconduct Prince Andrew.\nOn all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who\nseemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches, and\nfencing from the village.\n“There now, Prince! We can’t stop those fellows,” said the staff officer\npointing to the soldiers. “The officers don’t keep them in hand. And there,”"}, {"page": 247, "text": "he pointed to a sutler’s tent, “they crowd in and sit. This morning I turned\nthem all out and now look, it’s full again. I must go there, Prince, and scare\nthem a bit. It won’t take a moment.”\n“Yes, let’s go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,” said Prince\nAndrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.\n“Why didn’t you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you\nsomething.”\nThey dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed and\nweary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.\n“Now what does this mean, gentlemen?” said the staff officer, in the\nreproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than once.\n“You know it won’t do to leave your posts like this. The prince gave orders\nthat no one should leave his post. Now you, Captain,” and he turned to a\nthin, dirty little artillery officer who without his boots (he had given them to\nthe canteen keeper to dry), in only his stockings, rose when they entered,\nsmiling not altogether comfortably.\n“Well, aren’t you ashamed of yourself, Captain Túshin?” he continued.\n“One would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example,\nyet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be sounded and you’ll\nbe in a pretty position without your boots!” (The staff officer smiled.)\n“Kindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of you, all!” he added in a tone\nof command.\nPrince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer\nTúshin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to the\nother, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes from\nPrince Andrew to the staff officer.\n“The soldiers say it feels easier without boots,” said Captain Túshin\nsmiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishing to adopt a\njocular tone. But before he had finished he felt that his jest was\nunacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.\n“Kindly return to your posts,” said the staff officer trying to preserve his\ngravity.\nPrince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer’s small figure. There\nwas something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic, but\nextremely attractive."}, {"page": 248, "text": "The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.\nHaving ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking\nsoldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left some\nentrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up\nred. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves despite the cold\nwind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants; spadefuls of\nred clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen\nhands. Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at the entrenchment,\nand went on again. Just behind it they came upon some dozens of soldiers,\ncontinually replaced by others, who ran from the entrenchment. They had to\nhold their noses and put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned\natmosphere of these latrines.\n“Voilà l’agrément des camps, monsieur le prince,” * said the staff\nofficer.\n* “This is a pleasure one gets in camp, Prince.”\nThey rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could already be\nseen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.\n“That’s our battery,” said the staff officer indicating the highest point.\n“It’s in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots. You can see\neverything from there; let’s go there, Prince.”\n“Thank you very much, I will go on alone,” said Prince Andrew, wishing\nto rid himself of this staff officer’s company, “please don’t trouble yourself\nfurther.”\nThe staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.\nThe farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and\ncheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had been in\nthe baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven\nmiles away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm\ncould be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the\nmore confident was the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in their\ngreatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company officers\nwere counting the men, poking the last man in each section in the ribs and\ntelling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered over the whole place\nwere dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry\nchatter and laughter; around the fires sat others, dressed and undressed,"}, {"page": 249, "text": "drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and\ncrowding round the boilers and porridge cookers. In one company dinner\nwas ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler,\nwaiting till the sample, which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a\nwooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter, had been\ntasted.\nAnother company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka,\ncrowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who, tilting\na keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him. The soldiers\nlifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces, emptied them,\nrolling the vodka in their mouths, and walked away from the sergeant major\nwith brightened expressions, licking their lips and wiping them on the\nsleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces were as serene as if all this were\nhappening at home awaiting peaceful encampment, and not within sight of\nthe enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on\nthe field. After passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev\ngrenadiers—fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs—near the\nshelter of the regimental commander, higher than and different from the\nothers, Prince Andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before\nwhom lay a naked man. Two soldiers held him while two others were\nflourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back. The\nman shrieked unnaturally. A stout major was pacing up and down the line,\nand regardless of the screams kept repeating:\n“It’s a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest, honorable,\nand brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him, he’s a\nscoundrel. Go on! Go on!”\nSo the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural\nscreams, continued.\n“Go on, go on!” said the major.\nA young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face\nstepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as\nhe rode by.\nPrince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it.

Besides the soldiers who formed the picket line on either\nside, there were many curious onlookers who, jesting and laughing, stared\nat their strange foreign enemies.\nSince early morning—despite an injunction not to approach the picket\nline—the officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away. The soldiers\nforming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a curiosity, no longer\nlooked at the French but paid attention to the sight-seers and grew weary\nwaiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew halted to have a look at the French.\n“Look! Look there!” one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a\nRussian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and\nwas rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. “Hark to him\njabbering! Fine, isn’t it? It’s all the Frenchy can do to keep up with him.\nThere now, Sídorov!”\n“Wait a bit and listen. It’s fine!” answered Sídorov, who was considered\nan adept at French.\nThe soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dólokhov. Prince Andrew\nrecognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. Dólokhov had\ncome from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with his\ncaptain.\n“Now then, go on, go on!” incited the officer, bending forward and trying\nnot to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him.\n“More, please: more! What’s he saying?”\nDólokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot\ndispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the\ncampaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was\ntrying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all the way\nfrom Ulm, while Dólokhov maintained that the Russians had not\nsurrendered but had beaten the French.\n“We have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off,” said\nDólokhov.\n“Only take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!” said the\nFrench grenadier.\nThe French onlookers and listeners laughed.\n“We’ll make you dance as we did under Suvórov...,” * said Dólokhov.\n* “On vous fera danser.”"}, {"page": 251, "text": "“Qu’ est-ce qu’il chante?” * asked a Frenchman.\n* “What’s he singing about?”\n“It’s ancient history,” said another, guessing that it referred to a former\nwar. “The Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the others...”\n“Bonaparte...” began Dólokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.\n“Not Bonaparte.

Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!” came peals of such healthy and\ngood-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French\ninvoluntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to\nunload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as\nquickly as possible.\nBut the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and\nentrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon\nconfronted one another as before."}, {"page": 252, "text": "CHAPTER XVI\nHaving ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince\nAndrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told\nhim the whole field could be seen. Here he dismounted, and stopped beside\nthe farthest of the four unlimbered cannon. Before the guns an artillery\nsentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the officer\narrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing. Behind\nthe guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and\nartillerymen’s bonfires. To the left, not far from the farthest cannon, was a\nsmall, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of\nofficers’ voices in eager conversation.\nIt was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the\ngreater part of the enemy’s opened out from this battery. Just facing it, on\nthe crest of the opposite hill, the village of Schön Grabern could be seen,\nand in three places to left and right the French troops amid the smoke of\ntheir campfires, the greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself\nand behind the hill. To the left from that village, amid the smoke, was\nsomething resembling a battery, but it was impossible to see it clearly with\nthe naked eye. Our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which\ndominated the French position. Our infantry were stationed there, and at the\nfarthest point the dragoons. In the center, where Túshin’s battery stood and\nfrom which Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and\nmost direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Schön\nGrabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked the\nbonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French line was wider\nthan ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides.\nBehind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it difficult for\nartillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew took out his notebook and,\nleaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the position. He made some notes\non two points, intending to mention them to Bagratión. His idea was, first,"}, {"page": 253, "text": "to concentrate all the artillery in the center, and secondly, to withdraw the\ncavalry to the other side of the dip. Prince Andrew, being always near the\ncommander in chief, closely following the mass movements and general\norders, and constantly studying historical accounts of battles, involuntarily\npictured to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad\noutline. He imagined only important possibilities: “If the enemy attacks the\nright flank,” he said to himself, “the Kiev grenadiers and the Podólsk\nchasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center come up. In\nthat case the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack. If\nthey attack our center we, having the center battery on this high ground,\nshall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and retreat to the dip by\nechelons.” So he reasoned.... All the time he had been beside the gun, he\nhad heard the voices of the officers distinctly, but as often happens had not\nunderstood a word of what they were saying. Suddenly, however, he was\nstruck by a voice coming from the shed, and its tone was so sincere that he\ncould not but listen.\n“No, friend,” said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a\nfamiliar voice, “what I say is that if it were possible to know what is beyond\ndeath, none of us would be afraid of it. That’s so, friend.”\nAnother, a younger voice, interrupted him: “Afraid or not, you can’t\nescape it anyhow.”\n“All the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,” said a third manly\nvoice interrupting them both. “Of course you artillery men are very wise,\nbecause you can take everything along with you—vodka and snacks.”\nAnd the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer, laughed.\n“Yes, one is afraid,” continued the first speaker, he of the familiar voice.\n“One is afraid of the unknown, that’s what it is. Whatever we may say about\nthe soul going to the sky... we know there is no sky but only an\natmosphere.”\nThe manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.\n“Well, stand us some of your herb vodka, Túshin,” it said.\n“Why,” thought Prince Andrew, “that’s the captain who stood up in the\nsutler’s hut without his boots.” He recognized the agreeable, philosophizing\nvoice with pleasure."}, {"page": 254, "text": "“Some herb vodka? Certainly!” said Túshin. “But still, to conceive a\nfuture life...”\nHe did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air; nearer and\nnearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it had not\nfinished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near the shed\nwith super human force, throwing up a mass of earth. The ground seemed to\ngroan at the terrible impact.\nAnd immediately Túshin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and\nhis kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed followed by the\nowner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer who hurried off to his\ncompany, buttoning up his coat as he ran."}, {"page": 255, "text": "CHAPTER XVII\nMounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery,\nlooking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. His eyes ran rapidly\nover the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of\nthe French now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left. The\nsmoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two mounted Frenchmen, probably\nadjutants, were galloping up the hill. A small but distinctly visible enemy\ncolumn was moving down the hill, probably to strengthen the front line.\nThe smoke of the first shot had not yet dispersed before another puff\nappeared, followed by a report. The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned\nhis horse and galloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagratión. He heard\nthe cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent. Evidently our\nguns had begun to reply. From the bottom of the slope, where the parleys\nhad taken place, came the report of musketry.\nLemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte’s stern letter, and\nMurat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once moved his\nforces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian wings, hoping\nbefore evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to crush the\ncontemptible detachment that stood before him.\n“It has begun. Here it is!” thought Prince Andrew, feeling the blood rush\nto his heart. “But where and how will my Toulon present itself?”\nPassing between the companies that had been eating porridge and\ndrinking vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same\nrapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready,\nand on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his heart.\n“It has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!” was what the face of each\nsoldier and each officer seemed to say.\nBefore he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he\nsaw, in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming toward"}, {"page": 256, "text": "him. The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a\nwhite horse, was Prince Bagratión. Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for him\nto come up; Prince Bagratión reined in his horse and recognizing Prince\nAndrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew told him\nwhat he had seen.\nThe feeling, “It has begun! Here it is!” was seen even on Prince\nBagratión’s hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes. Prince\nAndrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he\ncould tell what, if anything, this man was thinking and feeling at that\nmoment. “Is there anything at all behind that impassive face?” Prince\nAndrew asked himself as he looked. Prince Bagratión bent his head in sign\nof agreement with what Prince Andrew told him, and said, “Very good!” in\na tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and was reported\nto him was exactly what he had foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of breath with\nhis rapid ride, spoke quickly. Prince Bagratión, uttering his words with an\nOriental accent, spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that there\nwas no need to hurry. However, he put his horse to a trot in the direction of\nTúshin’s battery. Prince Andrew followed with the suite. Behind Prince\nBagratión rode an officer of the suite, the prince’s personal adjutant,\nZherkóv, an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed\nhorse, and a civilian—an accountant who had asked permission to be\npresent at the battle out of curiosity. The accountant, a stout, full-faced man,\nlooked around him with a naïve smile of satisfaction and presented a\nstrange appearance among the hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his\ncamlet coat, as he jolted on his horse with a convoy officer’s saddle.\n“He wants to see a battle,” said Zherkóv to Bolkónski, pointing to the\naccountant, “but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already.”\n“Oh, leave off!” said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning\nsmile, as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherkóv’s joke, and\npurposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.\n“It is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince,” said the staff officer. (He\nremembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a\nprince, but could not get it quite right.)\nBy this time they were all approaching Túshin’s battery, and a ball struck\nthe ground in front of them.\n“What’s that that has fallen?” asked the accountant with a naïve smile."}, {"page": 257, "text": "“A French pancake,” answered Zherkóv.\n“So that’s what they hit with?” asked the accountant. “How awful!”\nHe seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished speaking\nwhen they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly\nended with a thud into something soft... f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding a\nlittle to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with his\nhorse. Zherkóv and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned their\nhorses away. The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack, and examined\nhim with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the horse still\nstruggled.\nPrince Bagratión screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the\ncause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to say, “Is it\nworth while noticing trifles?” He reined in his horse with the care of a\nskillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his saber which had\ncaught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber of a kind no longer in\ngeneral use. Prince Andrew remembered the story of Suvórov giving his\nsaber to Bagratión in Italy, and the recollection was particularly pleasant at\nthat moment. They had reached the battery at which Prince Andrew had\nbeen when he examined the battlefield.\n“Whose company?” asked Prince Bagratión of an artilleryman standing\nby the ammunition wagon.\nHe asked, “Whose company?” but he really meant, “Are you frightened\nhere?” and the artilleryman understood him.\n“Captain Túshin’s, your excellency!” shouted the red-haired, freckled\ngunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.\n“Yes, yes,” muttered Bagratión as if considering something, and he rode\npast the limbers to the farthest cannon.\nAs he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his\nsuite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see the\ngunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its former\nposition. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, holding a mop,\nhis legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while Number Two with a trembling\nhand placed a charge in the cannon’s mouth. The short, round-shouldered\nCaptain Túshin, stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage, moved forward"}, {"page": 258, "text": "and, not noticing the general, looked out shading his eyes with his small\nhand.\n“Lift it two lines more and it will be just right,” cried he in a feeble voice\nto which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill-suited to his weak figure.\n“Number Two!” he squeaked. “Fire, Medvédev!”\nBagratión called to him, and Túshin, raising three fingers to his cap with\na bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a\npriest’s benediction, approached the general. Though Túshin’s guns had\nbeen intended to cannonade the valley, he was firing incendiary balls at the\nvillage of Schön Grabern visible just opposite, in front of which large\nmasses of French were advancing.\nNo one had given Túshin orders where and at what to fire, but after\nconsulting his sergeant major, Zakharchénko, for whom he had great\nrespect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the\nvillage. “Very good!” said Bagratión in reply to the officer’s report, and\nbegan deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him.\nThe French had advanced nearest on our right. Below the height on which\nthe Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the rivulet flowed, the\nsoul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard, and much farther\nto the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed out to\nBagratión a French column that was outflanking us. To the left the horizon\nbounded by the adjacent wood. Prince Bagratión ordered two battalions\nfrom the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank. The officer of the\nsuite ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away, the\nguns would remain without support. Prince Bagratión turned to the officer\nand with his dull eyes looked at him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew\nthat the officer’s remark was just and that really no answer could be made\nto it. But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the\ncommander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of\nthe French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in\ndisorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagratión\nbowed his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to the\nright and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French.\nBut this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the\ncommander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the"}, {"page": 259, "text": "ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men\nuselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood.\n“Very good!” said Bagratión.\nAs he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and as it\nwas too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there himself, Prince\nBagratión sent Zherkóv to tell the general in command (the one who had\nparaded his regiment before Kutúzov at Braunau) that he must retreat as\nquickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear, as the right flank would\nprobably not be able to withstand the enemy’s attack very long. About\nTúshin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all was\nforgotten. Prince Andrew listened attentively to Bagratión’s colloquies with\nthe commanding officers and the orders he gave them and, to his surprise,\nfound that no orders were really given, but that Prince Bagratión tried to\nmake it appear that everything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will\nof subordinate commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least\nin accord with his intentions. Prince Andrew noticed, however, that though\nwhat happened was due to chance and was independent of the commander’s\nwill, owing to the tact Bagratión showed, his presence was very valuable.\nOfficers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm;\nsoldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew more cheerful in his presence,\nand were evidently anxious to display their courage before him."}, {"page": 260, "text": "CHAPTER XVIII\nPrince Bagratión, having reached the highest point of our right flank,\nbegan riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on\naccount of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to the\nhollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the\nactual battlefield. They began to meet wounded men. One with a bleeding\nhead and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported\nhim under the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting\nblood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth. Another was\nwalking sturdily by himself but without his musket, groaning aloud and\nswinging his arm which had just been hurt, while blood from it was\nstreaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had that moment been\nwounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering. Crossing a road\nthey descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground;\nthey also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded. The\nsoldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and despite the general’s\npresence were talking loudly and gesticulating. In front of them rows of\ngray cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and an officer catching\nsight of Bagratión rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers,\nordering them back. Bagratión rode up to the ranks along which shots\ncrackled now here and now there, drowning the sound of voices and the\nshouts of command. The whole air reeked with smoke. The excited faces of\nthe soldiers were blackened with it. Some were using their ramrods, others\nputting powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their pouches,\nwhile others were firing, though who they were firing at could not be seen\nfor the smoke which there was no wind to carry away. A pleasant humming\nand whistling of bullets were often heard. “What is this?” thought Prince\nAndrew approaching the crowd of soldiers. “It can’t be an attack, for they\nare not moving; it can’t be a square—for they are not drawn up for that.”"}, {"page": 261, "text": "The commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a\npleasant smile—his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes,\ngiving him a mild expression, rode up to Bagratión and welcomed him as a\nhost welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment had been\nattacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been repulsed,\nhe had lost more than half his men. He said the attack had been repulsed,\nemploying this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment,\nbut in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that half-\nhour to the troops entrusted to him, and could not say with certainty\nwhether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up.\nAll he knew was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells\nbegan flying all over his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards\nsomeone had shouted “Cavalry!” and our men had begun firing. They were\nstill firing, not at the cavalry which had disappeared, but at French infantry\nwho had come into the hollow and were firing at our men. Prince Bagratión\nbowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and\nexpected. Turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two\nbattalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed. Prince\nAndrew was struck by the changed expression on Prince Bagratión’s face at\nthis moment. It expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on\nthe face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into\nthe water. The dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the\naffectation of profound thought. The round, steady, hawk’s eyes looked\nbefore him eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although\nhis movements were still slow and measured.\nThe commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagratión, entreating\nhim to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were. “Please,\nyour excellency, for God’s sake!” he kept saying, glancing for support at an\nofficer of the suite who turned away from him. “There, you see!” and he\ndrew attention to the bullets whistling, singing, and hissing continually\naround them. He spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter\nuses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax: “We are used to it, but you,\nsir, will blister your hands.” He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him,\nand his half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words. The\nstaff officer joined in the colonel’s appeals, but Bagratión did not reply; he\nonly gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to give room for the\ntwo approaching battalions. While he was speaking, the curtain of smoke"}, {"page": 262, "text": "that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began to move from\nright to left as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the hill opposite, with the\nFrench moving about on it, opened out before them. All eyes fastened\ninvoluntarily on this French column advancing against them and winding\ndown over the uneven ground. One could already see the soldiers’ shaggy\ncaps, distinguish the officers from the men, and see the standard flapping\nagainst its staff.\n“They march splendidly,” remarked someone in Bagratión’s suite.\nThe head of the column had already descended into the hollow. The clash\nwould take place on this side of it...\nThe remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up\nand moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came two\nbattalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order. Before they had reached\nBagratión, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step could be\nheard. On their left flank, nearest to Bagratión, marched a company\ncommander, a fine round-faced man, with a stupid and happy expression—\nthe same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed. At that moment he\nwas clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear\nas he passed the commander.\nWith the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with his\nmuscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full height\nwithout the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the\nsoldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close to his leg a\nnarrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a real weapon) and\nlooked now at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing\nstep, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as if all the powers of\nhis soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible\nmanner, and feeling that he was doing it well he was happy. “Left... left...\nleft...” he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step; and in time to\nthis, with stern but varied faces, the wall of soldiers burdened with\nknapsacks and muskets marched in step, and each one of these hundreds of\nsoldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate step, “Left...\nleft... left...” A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out of step; a\nsoldier who had fallen behind, his face showing alarm at his defection, ran\nat a trot, panting to catch up with his company. A cannon ball, cleaving the\nair, flew over the heads of Bagratión and his suite, and fell into the column"}, {"page": 263, "text": "to the measure of “Left... left!” “Close up!” came the company\ncommander’s voice in jaunty tones. The soldiers passed in a semicircle\nround something where the ball had fallen, and an old trooper on the flank,\na noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men, ran to\ncatch up his line and, falling into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and\nthrough the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the\nground in unison, one seemed to hear left... left... left.\n“Well done, lads!” said Prince Bagratión.\n“Glad to do our best, your ex’len-lency!” came a confused shout from the\nranks. A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on Bagratión\nas he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: “We know that\nourselves!” Another, without looking round, as though fearing to relax,\nshouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.\nThe order was given to halt and down knapsacks.\nBagratión rode round the ranks that had marched past him and\ndismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over his\nfelt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The head of the French\ncolumn, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.\n“Forward, with God!” said Bagratión, in a resolute, sonorous voice,\nturning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms, he\nwent forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a\ncavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him\nforward, and experienced great happiness.\nThe French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside Bagratión,\ncould clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their faces.\n(He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered legs and turned-\nout toes, climbed the hill with difficulty.) Prince Bagratión gave no further\norders and silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks. Suddenly one\nshot after another rang out from the French, smoke appeared all along their\nuneven ranks, and musket shots sounded. Several of our men fell, among\nthem the round-faced officer who had marched so gaily and complacently.\nBut at the moment the first report was heard, Bagratión looked round and\nshouted, “Hurrah!”\n“Hurrah—ah!—ah!” rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and\npassing Bagratión and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but\njoyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe."}, {"page": 264, "text": "CHAPTER XIX\nThe attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank. In\nthe center Túshin’s forgotten battery, which had managed to set fire to the\nSchön Grabern village, delayed the French advance. The French were\nputting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus gave us time to\nretreat. The retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground\nat the rear was hurried and noisy, but the different companies did not get\nmixed. But our left—which consisted of the Azóv and Podólsk infantry and\nthe Pávlograd hussars—was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by\nsuperior French forces under Lannes and was thrown into confusion.\nBagratión had sent Zherkóv to the general commanding that left flank with\norders to retreat immediately.\nZherkóv, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about and\ngalloped off. But no sooner had he left Bagratión than his courage failed\nhim. He was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous.\nHaving reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where the\nfiring was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they could\nnot possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.\nThe command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander\nof the regiment Kutúzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which Dólokhov\nwas serving as a private. But the command of the extreme left flank had\nbeen assigned to the commander of the Pávlograd regiment in which Rostóv\nwas serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two commanders were\nmuch exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on\nthe right flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged in\ndiscussion with the sole object of offending one another. But the regiments,\nboth cavalry and infantry, were by no means ready for the impending\naction. From privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were\nengaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the horses and the\ninfantry collecting wood."}, {"page": 265, "text": "“He higher iss dan I in rank,” said the German colonel of the hussars,\nflushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, “so let him do what\nhe vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars...

Cannon and musketry, mingling\ntogether, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes of\nLannes’ sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming\nup within twice the range of a musket shot. The general in command of the\ninfantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and having mounted drew\nhimself up very straight and tall and rode to the Pávlograd commander. The\ncommanders met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their\nhearts.\n“Once again, Colonel,” said the general, “I can’t leave half my men in the\nwood. I beg of you, I beg of you,” he repeated, “to occupy the position and\nprepare for an attack.”\n“I peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!” suddenly\nreplied the irate colonel. “If you vere in the cavalry...”\n“I am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if you\nare not aware of the fact...”\n“Quite avare, your excellency,” suddenly shouted the colonel, touching\nhis horse and turning purple in the face. “Vill you be so goot to come to ze\nfront and see dat zis position iss no goot? I don’t vish to destroy my men for\nyour pleasure!”\n“You forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own pleasure and\nI won’t allow it to be said!”\nTaking the colonel’s outburst as a challenge to his courage, the general\nexpanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the front line, as if\ntheir differences would be settled there amongst the bullets. They reached\nthe front, several bullets sped over them, and they halted in silence. There\nwas nothing fresh to be seen from the line, for from where they had been\nbefore it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among\nthe bushes and broken ground, as well as that the French were outflanking\nour left. The general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one\nanother like two fighting cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to\ndetect signs of cowardice in the other.

The French had attacked the\nmen collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer possible for the hussars\nto retreat with the infantry. They were cut off from the line of retreat on the\nleft by the French. However inconvenient the position, it was now\nnecessary to attack in order to cut a way through for themselves.\nThe squadron in which Rostóv was serving had scarcely time to mount\nbefore it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge, there\nwas nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that terrible\ndividing line of uncertainty and fear—resembling the line separating the\nliving from the dead—lay between them. All were conscious of this unseen\nline, and the question whether they would cross it or not, and how they\nwould cross it, agitated them all.\nThe colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to questions put to\nhim by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on having his own\nway, gave an order. No one said anything definite, but the rumor of an\nattack spread through the squadron. The command to form up rang out and\nthe sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards. Still no one\nmoved. The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars alike, felt that the\ncommander did not himself know what to do, and this irresolution\ncommunicated itself to the men.\n“If only they would be quick!” thought Rostóv, feeling that at last the\ntime had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often\nheard from his fellow hussars.\n“Fo’ward, with God, lads!” rang out Denísov’s voice. “At a twot\nfo’ward!”\nThe horses’ croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at the\nreins and started of his own accord.\nBefore him, on the right, Rostóv saw the front lines of his hussars and\nstill farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to\nbe the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some way off.\n“Faster!” came the word of command, and Rostóv felt Rook’s flanks\ndrooping as he broke into a gallop."}, {"page": 267, "text": "Rostóv anticipated his horse’s movements and became more and more\nelated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had been in the\nmiddle of the line that had seemed so terrible—and now he had crossed that\nline and not only was there nothing terrible, but everything was becoming\nmore and more happy and animated. “Oh, how I will slash at him!” thought\nRostóv, gripping the hilt of his saber.\n“Hur-a-a-a-ah!” came a roar of voices. “Let anyone come my way now,”\nthought Rostóv driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go at a full\ngallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was already\nvisible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the\nsquadron. Rostóv raised his saber, ready to strike, but at that instant the\ntrooper Nikítenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and\nRostóv felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with\nunnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From behind him\nBondarchúk, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked angrily at\nhim. Bondarchúk’s horse swerved and galloped past.\n“How is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!” Rostóv asked\nand answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle of a field.\nInstead of the moving horses and hussars’ backs, he saw nothing before him\nbut the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There was warm blood\nunder his arm. “No, I am wounded and the horse is killed.” Rook tried to\nrise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his rider’s leg. Blood was flowing\nfrom his head; he struggled but could not rise. Rostóv also tried to rise but\nfell back, his sabretache having become entangled in the saddle. Where our\nmen were, and where the French, he did not know. There was no one near.\nHaving disentangled his leg, he rose. “Where, on which side, was now\nthe line that had so sharply divided the two armies?” he asked himself and\ncould not answer. “Can something bad have happened to me?” he wondered\nas he got up: and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was\nhanging on his benumbed left arm. The wrist felt as if it were not his. He\nexamined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find blood on it. “Ah, here are\npeople coming,” he thought joyfully, seeing some men running toward him.\n“They will help me!” In front came a man wearing a strange shako and a\nblue cloak, swarthy, sunburned, and with a hooked nose.

He was being held by the arms and his horse was\nbeing led behind him.\n“It must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will take me\ntoo? Who are these men?” thought Rostóv, scarcely believing his eyes.\n“Can they be French?” He looked at the approaching Frenchmen, and\nthough but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack\nthem to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not\nbelieve his eyes. “Who are they? Why are they running? Can they be\ncoming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone is so fond of?”\nHe remembered his mother’s love for him, and his family’s, and his\nfriends’, and the enemy’s intention to kill him seemed impossible. “But\nperhaps they may do it!” For more than ten seconds he stood not moving\nfrom the spot or realizing the situation. The foremost Frenchman, the one\nwith the hooked nose, was already so close that the expression of his face\ncould be seen. And the excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging\ndown, holding his breath, and running so lightly, frightened Rostóv. He\nseized his pistol and, instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran\nwith all his might toward the bushes. He did not now run with the feeling of\ndoubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the\nfeeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One single sentiment, that of fear\nfor his young and happy life, possessed his whole being. Rapidly leaping\nthe furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at\ncatchplay, now and then turning his good-natured, pale, young face to look\nback. A shudder of terror went through him: “No, better not look,” he\nthought, but having reached the bushes he glanced round once more. The\nFrench had fallen behind, and just as he looked round the first man changed\nhis run to a walk and, turning, shouted something loudly to a comrade\nfarther back. Rostóv paused. “No, there’s some mistake,” thought he. “They\ncan’t have wanted to kill me.” But at the same time, his left arm felt as\nheavy as if a seventy-pound weight were tied to it. He could run no more.\nThe Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rostóv closed his eyes and\nstooped down. One bullet and then another whistled past him. He mustered\nhis last remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his right, and\nreached the bushes. Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters."}, {"page": 269, "text": "CHAPTER XX\nThe infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of\nthe wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and retreated\nas a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his fear, uttered the senseless cry,\n“Cut off!” that is so terrible in battle, and that word infected the whole\ncrowd with a feeling of panic.\n“Surrounded! Cut off? We’re lost!” shouted the fugitives.\nThe moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the general\nrealized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, and the\nthought that he, an exemplary officer of many years’ service who had never\nbeen to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or\ninefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry\ncolonel, his own dignity as a general, and above all quite forgetting the\ndanger and all regard for self-preservation, he clutched the crupper of his\nsaddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to the regiment under a hail of\nbullets which fell around, but fortunately missed him. His one desire was to\nknow what was happening and at any cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if\nhe had made one, so that he, an exemplary officer of twenty-two years’\nservice, who had never been censured, should not be held to blame.\nHaving galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind the\ncopse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and\ndescending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation which decides the\nfate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to\nthe voice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him, continue\ntheir flight? Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the\nsoldiers, despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness\nto his former self, and the flourishing of his saber, the soldiers all continued\nto run, talking, firing into the air, and disobeying orders. The moral\nhesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a\npanic."}, {"page": 270, "text": "The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the\npowder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at that\nmoment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent\nreason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and Russian\nsharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was Timókhin’s company,\nwhich alone had maintained its order in the wood and, having lain in\nambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly. Timókhin, armed\nonly with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and\nsuch mad, drunken determination that, taken by surprise, the French had\nthrown down their muskets and run. Dólokhov, running beside Timókhin,\nkilled a Frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the\nsurrendering French officer by his collar. Our fugitives returned, the\nbattalions re-formed, and the French who had nearly cut our left flank in\nhalf were for the moment repulsed. Our reserve units were able to join up,\nand the fight was at an end. The regimental commander and Major\nEkonómov had stopped beside a bridge, letting the retreating companies\npass by them, when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander’s\nstirrup, almost leaning against him. The man was wearing a bluish coat of\nbroadcloth, he had no knapsack or cap, his head was bandaged, and over his\nshoulder a French munition pouch was slung. He had an officer’s sword in\nhis hand. The soldier was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the\ncommander’s face, and his lips were smiling. Though the commander was\noccupied in giving instructions to Major Ekonómov, he could not help\ntaking notice of the soldier.\n“Your excellency, here are two trophies,” said Dólokhov, pointing to the\nFrench sword and pouch. “I have taken an officer prisoner. I stopped the\ncompany.” Dólokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt\nsentences. “The whole company can bear witness. I beg you will remember\nthis, your excellency!”\n“All right, all right,” replied the commander, and turned to Major\nEkonómov.\nBut Dólokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around his\nhead, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.\n“A bayonet wound.

When the supports attached to Túshin’s battery\nhad been moved away in the middle of the action by someone’s order, the\nbattery had continued firing and was only not captured by the French\nbecause the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery\nto continue firing from four quite undefended guns. On the contrary, the\nenergetic action of that battery led the French to suppose that here—in the\ncenter—the main Russian forces were concentrated. Twice they had\nattempted to attack this point, but on each occasion had been driven back by\ngrapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock.\nSoon after Prince Bagratión had left him, Túshin had succeeded in setting\nfire to Schön Grabern.\n“Look at them scurrying! It’s burning! Just see the smoke! Fine! Grand!\nLook at the smoke, the smoke!” exclaimed the artillerymen, brightening up.\nAll the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the direction\nof the conflagration. As if urging each other on, the soldiers cried at each\nshot: “Fine! That’s good! Look at it... Grand!” The fire, fanned by the\nbreeze, was rapidly spreading. The French columns that had advanced\nbeyond the village went back; but as though in revenge for this failure, the\nenemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at\nTúshin’s battery.\nIn their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully\ncannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this battery when\ntwo balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one knocking over two\nhorses and another tearing off a munition-wagon driver’s leg. Their spirits\nonce roused were, however, not diminished, but only changed character.\nThe horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage, the\nwounded were carried away, and the four guns were turned against the ten-\ngun battery. Túshin’s companion officer had been killed at the beginning of\nthe engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the guns’\ncrews had been disabled, but the artillerymen were still as merry and lively\nas ever. Twice they noticed the French appearing below them, and then they\nfired grapeshot at them."}, {"page": 272, "text": "Little Túshin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly to\n“refill my pipe for that one!” and then, scattering sparks from it, ran\nforward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French.\n“Smack at ‘em, lads!” he kept saying, seizing the guns by the wheels and\nworking the screws himself.\nAmid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always made\nhim jump, Túshin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun,\nnow aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders about replacing\ndead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his\nfeeble voice, so high pitched and irresolute. His face grew more and more\nanimated. Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn\naway from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always the case,\nhesitated about lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers, for the most part\nhandsome fellows and, as is always the case in an artillery company, a head\nand shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer—all looked at their\ncommander like children in an embarrassing situation, and the expression\non his face was invariably reflected on theirs.\nOwing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and\nactivity, Túshin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear,\nand the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never occurred to\nhim. On the contrary, he became more and more elated. It seemed to him\nthat it was a very long time ago, almost a day, since he had first seen the\nenemy and fired the first shot, and that the corner of the field he stood on\nwas well-known and familiar ground. Though he thought of everything,\nconsidered everything, and did everything the best of officers could do in\nhis position, he was in a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness.\nFrom the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and\nthud of the enemy’s cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring faces of\nthe crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood of men and\nhorses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy’s side (always followed\nby a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a gun, a horse), from the\nsight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of\nhis brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure. The enemy’s guns were\nin his fancy not guns but pipes from which occasional puffs were blown by\nan invisible smoker."}, {"page": 273, "text": "“There... he’s puffing again,” muttered Túshin to himself, as a small\ncloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the wind.\n“Now look out for the ball... we’ll throw it back.”\n“What do you want, your honor?” asked an artilleryman, standing close\nby, who heard him muttering.\n“Nothing... only a shell...” he answered.\n“Come along, our Matvévna!” he said to himself. “Matvévna” * was the\nname his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which was large and\nof an old pattern. The French swarming round their guns seemed to him like\nants. In that world, the handsome drunkard Number One of the second\ngun’s crew was “uncle”; Túshin looked at him more often than at anyone\nelse and took delight in his every movement. The sound of musketry at the\nfoot of the hill, now diminishing, now increasing, seemed like someone’s\nbreathing. He listened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds.\n* Daughter of Matthew.\n“Ah! Breathing again, breathing!” he muttered to himself.\nHe imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was\nthrowing cannon balls at the French with both hands.\n“Now then, Matvévna, dear old lady, don’t let me down!” he was saying\nas he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice called above\nhis head: “Captain Túshin! Captain!”\nTúshin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had turned\nhim out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping voice:\n“Are you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you...”\n“Why are they down on me?” thought Túshin, looking in alarm at his\nsuperior.\n“I... don’t...” he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap. “I...”\nBut the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. A cannon ball,\nflying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse. He paused,\nand just as he was about to say something more, another ball stopped him.\nHe turned his horse and galloped off.\n“Retire! All to retire!” he shouted from a distance."}, {"page": 274, "text": "The soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same\norder.\nIt was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the space\nwhere Túshin’s guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a\nbroken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses. Blood\nwas gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the limbers lay several\ndead men. One ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a\nnervous shudder run down his spine. But the mere thought of being afraid\nroused him again. “I cannot be afraid,” thought he, and dismounted slowly\namong the guns. He delivered the order and did not leave the battery. He\ndecided to have the guns removed from their positions and withdrawn in his\npresence. Together with Túshin, stepping across the bodies and under a\nterrible fire from the French, he attended to the removal of the guns.\n“A staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off,” said an\nartilleryman to Prince Andrew. “Not like your honor!”\nPrince Andrew said nothing to Túshin. They were both so busy as to\nseem not to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two\ncannon that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down\nthe hill (one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince\nAndrew rode up to Túshin.\n“Well, till we meet again...” he said, holding out his hand to Túshin.\n“Good-by, my dear fellow,” said Túshin. “Dear soul! Good-by, my dear\nfellow!” and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes."}, {"page": 275, "text": "CHAPTER XXI\nThe wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke,\nhung low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was growing dark and\nthe glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous. The cannonade\nwas dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded\noftener and nearer. As soon as Túshin with his guns, continually driving\nround or coming upon wounded men, was out of range of fire and had\ndescended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff, among them the\nstaff officer and Zherkóv, who had been twice sent to Túshin’s battery but\nhad never reached it. Interrupting one another, they all gave, and\ntransmitted, orders as to how to proceed, reprimanding and reproaching\nhim. Túshin gave no orders, and, silently—fearing to speak because at\nevery word he felt ready to weep without knowing why—rode behind on\nhis artillery nag. Though the orders were to abandon the wounded, many of\nthem dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun\ncarriages. The jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed\nout of Túshin’s wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on\n“Matvévna’s” carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet,\nsupporting one hand with the other, came up to Túshin and asked for a seat.\n“Captain, for God’s sake! I’ve hurt my arm,” he said timidly. “For God’s\nsake... I can’t walk. For God’s sake!”\nIt was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and\nbeen refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.\n“Tell them to give me a seat, for God’s sake!”\n“Give him a seat,” said Túshin. “Lay a cloak for him to sit on, lad,” he\nsaid, addressing his favorite soldier. “And where is the wounded officer?”\n“He has been set down. He died,” replied someone.\n“Help him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak,\nAntónov.”"}, {"page": 276, "text": "The cadet was Rostóv. With one hand he supported the other; he was pale\nand his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on “Matvévna,”\nthe gun from which they had removed the dead officer. The cloak they\nspread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm.\n“What, are you wounded, my lad?” said Túshin, approaching the gun on\nwhich Rostóv sat.\n“No, it’s a sprain.”\n“Then what is this blood on the gun carriage?” inquired Túshin.\n“It was the officer, your honor, stained it,” answered the artilleryman,\nwiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if apologizing for the state of\nhis gun.\nIt was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the\ninfantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted. It had\ngrown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces off, and\nthe firing had begun to subside. Suddenly, near by on the right, shouting\nand firing were again heard. Flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness. This\nwas the last French attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the\nvillage houses. They all rushed out of the village again, but Túshin’s guns\ncould not move, and the artillerymen, Túshin, and the cadet exchanged\nsilent glances as they awaited their fate. The firing died down and soldiers,\ntalking eagerly, streamed out of a side street.\n“Not hurt, Petróv?” asked one.\n“We’ve given it ‘em hot, mate! They won’t make another push now,” said\nanother.\n“You couldn’t see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows! Nothing\ncould be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isn’t there something to drink?”\nThe French had been repulsed for the last time. And again and again in\nthe complete darkness Túshin’s guns moved forward, surrounded by the\nhumming infantry as by a frame.\nIn the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing\nalways in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of\nhoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, the groans and voices of the\nwounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness\nof the night. The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their\ngroans, which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night.

Halt, is it? Did he thank us?” came eager questions\nfrom all sides. The whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a\nreport spread that they were ordered to halt: evidently those in front had\nhalted. All remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road.\nFires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain Túshin,\nhaving given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing station\nor a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled\non the road. Rostóv, too, dragged himself to the fire. From pain, cold, and\ndamp, a feverish shivering shook his whole body. Drowsiness was\nirresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by an excruciating pain in his\narm, for which he could find no satisfactory position. He kept closing his\neyes and then again looking at the fire, which seemed to him dazzlingly red,\nand at the feeble, round-shouldered figure of Túshin who was sitting cross-\nlegged like a Turk beside him. Túshin’s large, kind, intelligent eyes were\nfixed with sympathy and commiseration on Rostóv, who saw that Túshin\nwith his whole heart wished to help him but could not.\nFrom all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, who were\nwalking, driving past, and settling down all around. The sound of voices,\nthe tramping feet, the horses’ hoofs moving in mud, the crackling of wood\nfires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.\nIt was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the\ngloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm.\nRostóv looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around\nhim. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held his hands\nto the blaze, and turned away his face.\n“You don’t mind your honor?” he asked Túshin. “I’ve lost my company,\nyour honor. I don’t know where... such bad luck!”\nWith the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to\nthe bonfire, and addressing Túshin asked him to have the guns moved a\ntrifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to the\ncampfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying to\nsnatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.\n“You picked it up?... I dare say! You’re very smart!” one of them shouted\nhoarsely."}, {"page": 278, "text": "Then a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band,\ncame up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.\n“Must one die like a dog?” said he.\nTúshin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier ran\nup, begging a little fire for the infantry.\n“A nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you, fellow\ncountrymen. Thanks for the fire—we’ll return it with interest,” said he,\ncarrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.\nNext came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and\npassed by the fire. One of them stumbled.\n“Who the devil has put the logs on the road?” snarled he.\n“He’s dead—why carry him?” said another.\n“Shut up!”\nAnd they disappeared into the darkness with their load.\n“Still aching?” Túshin asked Rostóv in a whisper.\n“Yes.”\n“Your honor, you’re wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,” said a\ngunner, coming up to Túshin.\n“Coming, friend.”\nTúshin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight, walked\naway from the fire.\nNot far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared for\nhim, Prince Bagratión sat at dinner, talking with some commanding officers\nwho had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with the half-closed\neyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the general who had\nserved blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a glass of vodka and\nthe dinner; and the staff officer with the signet ring, and Zherkóv, uneasily\nglancing at them all, and Prince Andrew, pale, with compressed lips and\nfeverishly glittering eyes.\nIn a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French, and the\naccountant with the naïve face was feeling its texture, shaking his head in\nperplexity—perhaps because the banner really interested him, perhaps\nbecause it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at a dinner where\nthere was no place for him. In the next hut there was a French colonel who"}, {"page": 279, "text": "had been taken prisoner by our dragoons. Our officers were flocking in to\nlook at him. Prince Bagratión was thanking the individual commanders and\ninquiring into details of the action and our losses. The general whose\nregiment had been inspected at Braunau was informing the prince that as\nsoon as the action began he had withdrawn from the wood, mustered the\nmen who were woodcutting, and, allowing the French to pass him, had\nmade a bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the French\ntroops.\n“When I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was disorganized,\nI stopped in the road and thought: ‘I’ll let them come on and will meet them\nwith the fire of the whole battalion’—and that’s what I did.”\nThe general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not\nmanaged to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened. Perhaps\nit might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid all that\nconfusion what did or did not happen?\n“By the way, your excellency, I should inform you,” he continued—\nremembering Dólokhov’s conversation with Kutúzov and his last interview\nwith the gentleman-ranker—“that Private Dólokhov, who was reduced to\nthe ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my presence and particularly\ndistinguished himself.”\n“I saw the Pávlograd hussars attack there, your excellency,” chimed in\nZherkóv, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the hussars all that day,\nbut had heard about them from an infantry officer. “They broke up two\nsquares, your excellency.”\nSeveral of those present smiled at Zherkóv’s words, expecting one of his\nusual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory of\nour arms and of the day’s work, they assumed a serious expression, though\nmany of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any\nfoundation. Prince Bagratión turned to the old colonel:\n“Gentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically: infantry,\ncavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were abandoned in the\ncenter?” he inquired, searching with his eyes for someone. (Prince\nBagratión did not ask about the guns on the left flank; he knew that all the\nguns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action.) “I think\nI sent you?” he added, turning to the staff officer on duty."}, {"page": 280, "text": "“One was damaged,” answered the staff officer, “and the other I can’t\nunderstand. I was there all the time giving orders and had only just left.... It\nis true that it was hot there,” he added, modestly.\nSomeone mentioned that Captain Túshin was bivouacking close to the\nvillage and had already been sent for.\n“Oh, but you were there?” said Prince Bagratión, addressing Prince\nAndrew.\n“Of course, we only just missed one another,” said the staff officer, with\na smile to Bolkónski.\n“I had not the pleasure of seeing you,” said Prince Andrew, coldly and\nabruptly.\nAll were silent. Túshin appeared at the threshold and made his way\ntimidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past the\ngenerals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the\nsight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled\nover it. Several of those present laughed.\n“How was it a gun was abandoned?” asked Bagratión, frowning, not so\nmuch at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom Zherkóv\nlaughed loudest.\nOnly now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt\nand the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present\nthemselves to Túshin in all their horror. He had been so excited that he had\nnot thought about it until that moment. The officers’ laughter confused him\nstill more. He stood before Bagratión with his lower jaw trembling and was\nhardly able to mutter: “I don’t know... your excellency... I had no men...\nyour excellency.”\n“You might have taken some from the covering troops.”\nTúshin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that was\nperfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble, and\nsilently fixed his eyes on Bagratión as a schoolboy who has blundered looks\nat an examiner.\nThe silence lasted some time. Prince Bagratión, apparently not wishing to\nbe severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture to intervene.\nPrince Andrew looked at Túshin from under his brows and his fingers\ntwitched nervously."}, {"page": 281, "text": "“Your excellency!” Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt\nvoice, “you were pleased to send me to Captain Túshin’s battery. I went\nthere and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two guns\nsmashed, and no supports at all.”\nPrince Bagratión and Túshin looked with equal intentness at Bolkónski,\nwho spoke with suppressed agitation.\n“And, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion,” he\ncontinued, “we owe today’s success chiefly to the action of that battery and\nthe heroic endurance of Captain Túshin and his company,” and without\nawaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left the table.\nPrince Bagratión looked at Túshin, evidently reluctant to show distrust in\nBolkónski’s emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it, bent his\nhead, and told Túshin that he could go. Prince Andrew went out with him.\n“Thank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!” said Túshin.\nPrince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. He felt\nsad and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what he had hoped.\n“Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will\nall this end?” thought Rostóv, looking at the changing shadows before him.\nThe pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible drowsiness\noverpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the impression of\nthose voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical\npain. It was they, these soldiers—wounded and unwounded—it was they\nwho were crushing, weighing down, and twisting the sinews and scorching\nthe flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder. To rid himself of them he closed\nhis eyes.\nFor a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things\nappeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand, Sónya’s\nthin little shoulders, Natásha’s eyes and laughter, Denísov with his voice\nand mustache, and Telyánin and all that affair with Telyánin and Bogdánich.\nThat affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice, and it\nwas that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling\nand pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction. He tried to get\naway from them, but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a"}, {"page": 282, "text": "hair’s breadth. It would not ache—it would be well—if only they did not\npull it, but it was impossible to get rid of them.\nHe opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung less\nthan a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of falling snow were\nfluttering in that light. Túshin had not returned, the doctor had not come. He\nwas alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other side\nof the fire, warming his thin yellow body.\n“Nobody wants me!” thought Rostóv. “There is no one to help me or pity\nme. Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved.” He sighed and,\ndoing so, groaned involuntarily.\n“Eh, is anything hurting you?” asked the soldier, shaking his shirt out\nover the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added:\n“What a lot of men have been crippled today—frightful!”\nRostóv did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes fluttering\nabove the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm, bright home,\nhis fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his healthy body, and all the\naffection and care of his family. “And why did I come here?” he wondered.\nNext day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant of\nBagratión’s detachment was reunited to Kutúzov’s army."}, {"page": 283, "text": "BOOK THREE: 1805"}, {"page": 285, "text": "CHAPTER I\nPrince Vasíli was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans. Still\nless did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage. He was merely a\nman of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a\nhabit. Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted to himself,\nbut which formed the whole interest of his life, were constantly shaping\nthemselves in his mind, arising from the circumstances and persons he met.\nOf these plans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens, some\nonly beginning to form themselves, some approaching achievement, and\nsome in course of disintegration. He did not, for instance, say to himself:\n“This man now has influence, I must gain his confidence and friendship and\nthrough him obtain a special grant.” Nor did he say to himself: “Pierre is a\nrich man, I must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty\nthousand rubles I need.” But when he came across a man of position his\ninstinct immediately told him that this man could be useful, and without any\npremeditation Prince Vasíli took the first opportunity to gain his confidence,\nflatter him, become intimate with him, and finally make his request.\nHe had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment\nas Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of\nCouncilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to\nPetersburg and staying at his house. With apparent absent-mindedness, yet\nwith unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing, Prince Vasíli\ndid everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter. Had he thought out his\nplans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such\nunaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below\nhim in social standing. Something always drew him toward those richer and\nmore powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most\nopportune moment for making use of people.\nPierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezúkhov and a rich man, felt\nhimself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and\npreoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He had to sign"}, {"page": 286, "text": "papers, to present himself at government offices, the purpose of which was\nnot clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his estate near\nMoscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not even wish to\nknow of his existence but would now have been offended and grieved had\nhe chosen not to see them. These different people—businessmen, relations,\nand acquaintances alike—were all disposed to treat the young heir in the\nmost friendly and flattering manner: they were all evidently firmly\nconvinced of Pierre’s noble qualities. He was always hearing such words as:\n“With your remarkable kindness,” or, “With your excellent heart,” “You are\nyourself so honorable, Count,” or, “Were he as clever as you,” and so on,\ntill he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and\nextraordinary intelligence, the more so as in the depth of his heart it had\nalways seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent. Even\npeople who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly\nnow became gentle and affectionate. The angry eldest princess, with the\nlong waist and hair plastered down like a doll’s, had come into Pierre’s\nroom after the funeral. With drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told\nhim she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now\nfeel she had a right to ask him for anything, except only for permission,\nafter the blow she had received, to remain for a few weeks longer in the\nhouse she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much. She could not\nrefrain from weeping at these words. Touched that this statuesque princess\ncould so change, Pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness, without\nknowing what for. From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward\nPierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him.\n“Do this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she had to put up with a great\ndeal from the deceased,” said Prince Vasíli to him, handing him a deed to\nsign for the princess’ benefit.\nPrince Vasíli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw\nthis bone—a bill for thirty thousand rubles—to the poor princess that it\nmight not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid\nportfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder.\nThe younger sisters also became affectionate to him, especially the\nyoungest, the pretty one with the mole, who often made him feel confused\nby her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him."}, {"page": 287, "text": "It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it would\nhave seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could not but\nbelieve in the sincerity of those around him. Besides, he had no time to ask\nhimself whether these people were sincere or not. He was always busy and\nalways felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication. He felt as though he\nwere the center of some important and general movement; that something\nwas constantly expected of him, that if he did not do it he would grieve and\ndisappoint many people, but if he did this and that, all would be well; and\nhe did what was demanded of him, but still that happy result always\nremained in the future.\nMore than anyone else, Prince Vasíli took possession of Pierre’s affairs\nand of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death of Count\nBezúkhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had the air of a man\noppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for pity’s\nsake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was the son of his old friend\nand the possessor of such enormous wealth, to the caprice of fate and the\ndesigns of rogues. During the few days he spent in Moscow after the death\nof Count Bezúkhov, he would call Pierre, or go to him himself, and tell him\nwhat ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance, as if he were\nadding every time: “You know I am overwhelmed with business and it is\npurely out of charity that I trouble myself about you, and you also know\nquite well that what I propose is the only thing possible.”\n“Well, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,” said Prince Vasíli\none day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre’s elbow, speaking as if he\nwere saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could\nnot now be altered. “We start tomorrow and I’m giving you a place in my\ncarriage. I am very glad. All our important business here is now settled, and\nI ought to have been off long ago. Here is something I have received from\nthe chancellor. I asked him for you, and you have been entered in the\ndiplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. The diplomatic\ncareer now lies open before you.”\nNotwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words\nwere pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his career,\nwished to make some suggestion. But Prince Vasíli interrupted him in the\nspecial deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting his"}, {"page": 288, "text": "speech, which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was\nneeded.\n“Mais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience,\nand there is nothing to thank me for. No one has ever complained yet of\nbeing too much loved; and besides, you are free, you could throw it up\ntomorrow. But you will see everything for yourself when you get to\nPetersburg. It is high time for you to get away from these terrible\nrecollections.” Prince Vasíli sighed. “Yes, yes, my boy. And my valet can go\nin your carriage. Ah! I was nearly forgetting,” he added. “You know, mon\ncher, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so I have received what\nwas due from the Ryazán estate and will keep it; you won’t require it. We’ll\ngo into the accounts later.”\nBy “what was due from the Ryazán estate” Prince Vasíli meant several\nthousand rubles quitrent received from Pierre’s peasants, which the prince\nhad retained for himself.\nIn Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of\ngentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather the rank\n(for he did nothing), that Prince Vasíli had procured for him, and\nacquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so numerous that,\neven more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle, and\ncontinual expectation of some good, always in front of him but never\nattained.\nOf his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg.\nThe Guards had gone to the front; Dólokhov had been reduced to the ranks;\nAnatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew was\nabroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he used to\nlike to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with a friend older\nthan himself and whom he respected. His whole time was taken up with\ndinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince Vasíli’s house in the\ncompany of the stout princess, his wife, and his beautiful daughter Hélène.\nLike the others, Anna Pávlovna Schérer showed Pierre the change of\nattitude toward him that had taken place in society.\nFormerly in Anna Pávlovna’s presence, Pierre had always felt that what\nhe was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that remarks which\nseemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon\nas he uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolyte’s stupidest remarks"}, {"page": 289, "text": "came out clever and apt. Now everything Pierre said was charmant. Even if\nAnna Pávlovna did not say so, he could see that she wished to and only\nrefrained out of regard for his modesty.\nIn the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna\nPávlovna’s usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added: “You\nwill find the beautiful Hélène here, whom it is always delightful to see.”\nWhen he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some link\nwhich other people recognized had grown up between himself and Hélène,\nand that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were being\nimposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased him as an\nentertaining supposition.\nAnna Pávlovna’s “At Home” was like the former one, only the novelty\nshe offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a diplomatist fresh\nfrom Berlin with the very latest details of the Emperor Alexander’s visit to\nPotsdam, and of how the two august friends had pledged themselves in an\nindissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice against the enemy of the\nhuman race. Anna Pávlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy,\nevidently relating to the young man’s recent loss by the death of Count\nBezúkhov (everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he\nwas greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and\nher melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the\nmention of her most august Majesty the Empress Márya Fëdorovna. Pierre\nfelt flattered by this. Anna Pávlovna arranged the different groups in her\ndrawing room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which were Prince\nVasíli and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat. Another group was\nat the tea table. Pierre wished to join the former, but Anna Pávlovna—who\nwas in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom\nthousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put\nin action—seeing Pierre, touched his sleeve with her finger, saying:\n“Wait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening.” (She glanced\nat Hélène and smiled at her.) “My dear Hélène, be charitable to my poor\naunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for ten minutes. And that it\nwill not be too dull, here is the dear count who will not refuse to accompany\nyou.”\nThe beauty went to the aunt, but Anna Pávlovna detained Pierre, looking\nas if she had to give some final necessary instructions."}, {"page": 290, "text": "“Isn’t she exquisite?” she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately beauty as\nshe glided away. “And how she carries herself! For so young a girl, such\ntact, such masterly perfection of manner! It comes from her heart. Happy\nthe man who wins her! With her the least worldly of men would occupy a\nmost brilliant position in society. Don’t you think so? I only wanted to\nknow your opinion,” and Anna Pávlovna let Pierre go.\nPierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to Hélène’s perfection of\nmanner. If he ever thought of Hélène, it was just of her beauty and her\nremarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society.\nThe old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed\ndesirous of hiding her adoration for Hélène and inclined rather to show her\nfear of Anna Pávlovna. She looked at her niece, as if inquiring what she was\nto do with these people. On leaving them, Anna Pávlovna again touched\nPierre’s sleeve, saying: “I hope you won’t say that it is dull in my house\nagain,” and she glanced at Hélène.\nHélène smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility\nof anyone seeing her without being enchanted. The aunt coughed,\nswallowed, and said in French that she was very pleased to see Hélène, then\nshe turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome and the same look. In\nthe middle of a dull and halting conversation, Hélène turned to Pierre with\nthe beautiful bright smile that she gave to everyone. Pierre was so used to\nthat smile, and it had so little meaning for him, that he paid no attention to\nit. The aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had\nbelonged to Pierre’s father, Count Bezúkhov, and showed them her own\nbox. Princess Hélène asked to see the portrait of the aunt’s husband on the\nbox lid.\n“That is probably the work of Vinesse,” said Pierre, mentioning a\ncelebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox\nwhile trying to hear what was being said at the other table.\nHe half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox,\npassing it across Hélène’s back. Hélène stooped forward to make room, and\nlooked round with a smile. She was, as always at evening parties, wearing a\ndress such as was then fashionable, cut very low at front and back. Her bust,\nwhich had always seemed like marble to Pierre, was so close to him that his\nshortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and\nshoulders, so near to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to"}, {"page": 291, "text": "have touched them. He was conscious of the warmth of her body, the scent\nof perfume, and the creaking of her corset as she moved. He did not see her\nmarble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress, but all the charm\nof her body only covered by her garments. And having once seen this he\ncould not help being aware of it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we\nhave once seen through.\n“So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?” Hélène seemed\nto say. “You had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who\nmay belong to anyone—to you too,” said her glance. And at that moment\nPierre felt that Hélène not only could, but must, be his wife, and that it\ncould not be otherwise.\nHe knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the\naltar with her. How and when this would be he did not know, he did not\neven know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why, that\nit would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen.\nPierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see\nher as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every day\nuntil then, but he could no longer do it. He could not, any more than a man\nwho has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it\nfor a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a\ntuft of grass. She was terribly close to him. She already had power over\nhim, and between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of\nhis own will.\n“Well, I will leave you in your little corner,” came Anna Pávlovna’s\nvoice, “I see you are all right there.”\nAnd Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything\nreprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him that everyone\nknew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.\nA little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna Pávlovna said to\nhim: “I hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?”\nThis was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and\nPierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house\ndone up.\n“That’s a good thing, but don’t move from Prince Vasíli’s. It is good to\nhave a friend like the prince,” she said, smiling at Prince Vasíli. “I know"}, {"page": 292, "text": "something about that. Don’t I? And you are still so young. You need advice.\nDon’t be angry with me for exercising an old woman’s privilege.”\nShe paused, as women always do, expecting something after they have\nmentioned their age. “If you marry it will be a different thing,” she\ncontinued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre did not look at Hélène\nnor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He muttered\nsomething and colored.\nWhen he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what\nhad happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely understood\nthat the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was\nmentioned he had said absent-mindedly: “Yes, she’s good looking,” he had\nunderstood that this woman might belong to him.\n“But she’s stupid. I have myself said she is stupid,” he thought. “There is\nsomething nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites in me. I have\nbeen told that her brother Anatole was in love with her and she with him,\nthat there was quite a scandal and that that’s why he was sent away.\nHippolyte is her brother... Prince Vasíli is her father... It’s bad....” he\nreflected, but while he was thinking this (the reflection was still\nincomplete), he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line\nof thought had sprung up, and while thinking of her worthlessness he was\nalso dreaming of how she would be his wife, how she would love him\nbecome quite different, and how all he had thought and heard of her might\nbe false. And he again saw her not as the daughter of Prince Vasíli, but\nvisualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dress. “But no! Why did\nthis thought never occur to me before?” and again he told himself that it\nwas impossible, that there would be something unnatural, and as it seemed\nto him dishonorable, in this marriage. He recalled her former words and\nlooks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together. He\nrecalled Anna Pávlovna’s words and looks when she spoke to him about his\nhouse, recalled thousands of such hints from Prince Vasíli and others, and\nwas seized by terror lest he had already, in some way, bound himself to do\nsomething that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do. But at the\nvery time he was expressing this conviction to himself, in another part of\nhis mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty."}, {"page": 293, "text": "CHAPTER II\nIn November, 1805, Prince Vasíli had to go on a tour of inspection in four\ndifferent provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to visit his\nneglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole where his\nregiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas Bolkónski in\norder to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man. But\nbefore leaving home and undertaking these new affairs, Prince Vasíli had to\nsettle matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had latterly spent whole days at\nhome, that is, in Prince Vasíli’s house where he was staying, and had been\nabsurd, excited, and foolish in Hélène’s presence (as a lover should be), but\nhad not yet proposed to her.\n“This is all very fine, but things must be settled,” said Prince Vasíli to\nhimself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that Pierre who was\nunder such obligations to him (“But never mind that”) was not behaving\nvery well in this matter. “Youth, frivolity... well, God be with him,” thought\nhe, relishing his own goodness of heart, “but it must be brought to a head.\nThe day after tomorrow will be Lëlya’s name day. I will invite two or three\npeople, and if he does not understand what he ought to do then it will be my\naffair—yes, my affair.

He might perhaps have been able to free himself but that Prince Vasíli\n(who had rarely before given receptions) now hardly let a day go by without\nhaving an evening party at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished\nto spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyone’s expectation. Prince"}, {"page": 294, "text": "Vasíli, in the rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierre’s hand\nin passing and draw it downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out his\nwrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say: “Till\ntomorrow,” or, “Be in to dinner or I shall not see you,” or, “I am staying in\nfor your sake,” and so on. And though Prince Vasíli, when he stayed in (as\nhe said) for Pierre’s sake, hardly exchanged a couple of words with him,\nPierre felt unable to disappoint him. Every day he said to himself one and\nthe same thing: “It is time I understood her and made up my mind what she\nreally is. Was I mistaken before, or am I mistaken now? No, she is not\nstupid, she is an excellent girl,” he sometimes said to himself “she never\nmakes a mistake, never says anything stupid. She says little, but what she\ndoes say is always clear and simple, so she is not stupid. She never was\nabashed and is not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad woman!” He had\noften begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company, and she had\nalways answered him either by a brief but appropriate remark—showing\nthat it did not interest her—or by a silent look and smile which more\npalpably than anything else showed Pierre her superiority. She was right in\nregarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile.\nShe always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him\nalone, in which there was something more significant than in the general\nsmile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that everyone was\nwaiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that\nsooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror\nseized him at the thought of that dreadful step. A thousand times during that\nmonth and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that\ndreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: “What am I doing? I need resolution.\nCan it be that I have none?”\nHe wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter he\nlacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really\npossessed. Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel\nthemselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was overpowered by\na feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna Pávlovna’s, an\nunacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will.\nOn Hélène’s name day, a small party of just their own people—as his\nwife said—met for supper at Prince Vasíli’s. All these friends and relations\nhad been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be"}, {"page": 295, "text": "decided that evening. The visitors were seated at supper. Princess Kurágina,\na portly imposing woman who had once been handsome, was sitting at the\nhead of the table. On either side of her sat the more important guests—an\nold general and his wife, and Anna Pávlovna Schérer. At the other end sat\nthe younger and less important guests, and there too sat the members of the\nfamily, and Pierre and Hélène, side by side. Prince Vasíli was not having\nany supper: he went round the table in a merry mood, sitting down now by\none, now by another, of the guests. To each of them he made some careless\nand agreeable remark except to Pierre and Hélène, whose presence he\nseemed not to notice. He enlivened the whole party. The wax candles\nburned brightly, the silver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladies’ toilets and\nthe gold and silver of the men’s epaulets; servants in scarlet liveries moved\nround the table, the clatter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with the\nanimated hum of several conversations. At one end of the table, the old\nchamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her\npassionately, at which she laughed; at the other could be heard the story of\nthe misfortunes of some Mary Víktorovna or other. At the center of the\ntable, Prince Vasíli attracted everybody’s attention. With a facetious smile\non his face, he was telling the ladies about last Wednesday’s meeting of the\nImperial Council, at which Sergéy Kuzmích Vyazmítinov, the new military\ngovernor general of Petersburg, had received and read the then famous\nrescript of the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergéy Kuzmích, in\nwhich the Emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of\nthe people’s loyalty, that the declaration from Petersburg gave him\nparticular pleasure, and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation\nand would endeavor to be worthy of it. This rescript began with the words:\n“Sergéy Kuzmích, From all sides reports reach me,” etc.\n“Well, and so he never got farther than: ‘Sergéy Kuzmích’?” asked one of\nthe ladies.\n“Exactly, not a hair’s breadth farther,” answered Prince Vasíli, laughing,\n“‘Sergéy Kuzmích... From all sides... From all sides... Sergéy Kuzmích...’\nPoor Vyazmítinov could not get any farther! He began the rescript again and\nagain, but as soon as he uttered ‘Sergéy’ he sobbed, ‘Kuz-mí-ch,’ tears, and\n‘From all sides’ was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther. And\nagain his handkerchief, and again: ‘Sergéy Kuzmích, From all sides,’... and\ntears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it.”"}, {"page": 296, "text": "“Kuzmích... From all sides... and then tears,” someone repeated laughing.\n“Don’t be unkind,” cried Anna Pávlovna from her end of the table\nholding up a threatening finger. “He is such a worthy and excellent man,\nour dear Vyazmítinov....”\nEverybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where the\nhonored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the\ninfluence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and Hélène sat\nsilently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a suppressed smile\nbrightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing to do with Sergéy\nKuzmích—a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings. But much as all the\nrest laughed, talked, and joked, much as they enjoyed their Rhine wine,\nsauté, and ices, and however they avoided looking at the young couple, and\nheedless and unobservant as they seemed of them, one could feel by the\noccasional glances they gave that the story about Sergéy Kuzmích, the\nlaughter, and the food were all a pretense, and that the whole attention of\nthat company was directed to—Pierre and Hélène. Prince Vasíli mimicked\nthe sobbing of Sergéy Kuzmích and at the same time his eyes glanced\ntoward his daughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly\nsaid: “Yes... it’s getting on, it will all be settled today.” Anna Pávlovna\nthreatened him on behalf of “our dear Vyazmítinov,” and in her eyes, which,\nfor an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince Vasíli read a congratulation on his\nfuture son-in-law and on his daughter’s happiness. The old princess sighed\nsadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and glanced\nangrily at her daughter, and her sigh seemed to say: “Yes, there’s nothing\nleft for you and me but to sip sweet wine, my dear, now that the time has\ncome for these young ones to be thus boldly, provocatively happy.” “And\nwhat nonsense all this is that I am saying!” thought a diplomatist, glancing\nat the happy faces of the lovers. “That’s happiness!”\nInto the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that society\nhad entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome\nyoung man and woman for one another. And this human feeling dominated\neverything else and soared above all their affected chatter. Jests fell flat,\nnews was not interesting, and the animation was evidently forced. Not only\nthe guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this, and\nthey forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful Hélène with her\nradiant face and at the red, broad, and happy though uneasy face of Pierre."}, {"page": 297, "text": "It seemed as if the very light of the candles was focused on those two happy\nfaces alone.\nPierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased and\nembarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation.\nHe did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only now and then\ndetached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot unexpectedly\nthrough his mind.\n“So it is all finished!” he thought. “And how has it all happened? How\nquickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself alone, but\nbecause of everyone, it must inevitably come about. They are all expecting\nit, they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I cannot, disappoint\nthem. But how will it be? I do not know, but it will certainly happen!”\nthought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes.\nOr he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it\nawkward to attract everyone’s attention and to be considered a lucky man\nand, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris possessed of a\nHelen. “But no doubt it always is and must be so!” he consoled himself.\n“And besides, what have I done to bring it about? How did it begin? I\ntraveled from Moscow with Prince Vasíli. Then there was nothing. So why\nshould I not stay at his house? Then I played cards with her and picked up\nher reticule and drove out with her. How did it begin, when did it all come\nabout?” And here he was sitting by her side as her betrothed, seeing,\nhearing, feeling her nearness, her breathing, her movements, her beauty.\nThen it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so\nunusually beautiful, and that that was why they all looked so at him, and\nflattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest, raise his\nhead, and rejoice at his good fortune. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice\nrepeating something to him a second time. But Pierre was so absorbed that\nhe did not understand what was said.\n“I am asking you when you last heard from Bolkónski,” repeated Prince\nVasíli a third time. “How absent-minded you are, my dear fellow.”\nPrince Vasíli smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at him\nand Hélène. “Well, what of it, if you all know it?” thought Pierre. “What of\nit? It’s the truth!” and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile, and\nHélène smiled too."}, {"page": 298, "text": "“When did you get the letter? Was it from Olmütz?” repeated Prince\nVasíli, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute.\n“How can one talk or think of such trifles?” thought Pierre.\n“Yes, from Olmütz,” he answered, with a sigh.\nAfter supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the drawing\nroom. The guests began to disperse, some without taking leave of Hélène.\nSome, as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupation, came up\nto her for a moment and made haste to go away, refusing to let her see them\noff. The diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he left the drawing\nroom. He pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison with\nPierre’s happiness. The old general grumbled at his wife when she asked\nhow his leg was. “Oh, the old fool,” he thought. “That Princess Hélène will\nbe beautiful still when she’s fifty.”\n“I think I may congratulate you,” whispered Anna Pávlovna to the old\nprincess, kissing her soundly. “If I hadn’t this headache I’d have stayed\nlonger.”\nThe old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her\ndaughter’s happiness.\nWhile the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time\nalone with Hélène in the little drawing room where they were sitting. He\nhad often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her, but\nhad never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable, but he\ncould not make up his mind to take the final step. He felt ashamed; he felt\nthat he was occupying someone else’s place here beside Hélène. “This\nhappiness is not for you,” some inner voice whispered to him. “This\nhappiness is for those who have not in them what there is in you.”\nBut, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was\nsatisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple manner that this\nname day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had.\nSome of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in the\nlarge drawing room. Prince Vasíli came up to Pierre with languid footsteps.\nPierre rose and said it was getting late. Prince Vasíli gave him a look of\nstern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was so strange that one\ncould not take it in. But then the expression of severity changed, and he"}, {"page": 299, "text": "drew Pierre’s hand downwards, made him sit down, and smiled\naffectionately.\n“Well, Lëlya?” he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and addressing\nher with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have\npetted their children from babyhood, but which Prince Vasíli had only\nacquired by imitating other parents.\nAnd he again turned to Pierre.\n“Sergéy Kuzmích—From all sides—” he said, unbuttoning the top button\nof his waistcoat.\nPierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story\nabout Sergéy Kuzmích that interested Prince Vasíli just then, and Prince\nVasíli saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered something and went\naway. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was disconcerted. The sight\nof the discomposure of that old man of the world touched Pierre: he looked\nat Hélène and she too seemed disconcerted, and her look seemed to say:\n“Well, it is your own fault.”\n“The step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!” thought Pierre, and he\nagain began speaking about indifferent matters, about Sergéy Kuzmích,\nasking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly.\nHélène answered with a smile that she too had missed it.\nWhen Prince Vasíli returned to the drawing room, the princess, his wife,\nwas talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.\n“Of course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear...”\n“Marriages are made in heaven,” replied the elderly lady.\nPrince Vasíli passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down on a\nsofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed to be\ndozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.\n“Aline,” he said to his wife, “go and see what they are about.”\nThe princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and\nindifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and Hélène\nstill sat talking just as before.\n“Still the same,” she said to her husband.\nPrince Vasíli frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his\nface assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking"}, {"page": 300, "text": "himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went past the\nladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he went joyfully up to\nPierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre rose in alarm on\nseeing it.\n“Thank God!” said Prince Vasíli. “My wife has told me everything!” (He\nput one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter.)—“My dear\nboy... Lëlya... I am very pleased.” (His voice trembled.) “I loved your\nfather... and she will make you a good wife... God bless you!...”\nHe embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his\nmalodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.\n“Princess, come here!” he shouted.\nThe old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using her\nhandkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful Hélène’s\nhand several times. After a while they were left alone again.\n“All this had to be and could not be otherwise,” thought Pierre, “so it is\nuseless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good because it’s definite and\none is rid of the old tormenting doubt.” Pierre held the hand of his betrothed\nin silence, looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell.\n“Hélène!” he said aloud and paused.\n“Something special is always said in such cases,” he thought, but could\nnot remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face. She drew\nnearer to him. Her face flushed.\n“Oh, take those off... those...” she said, pointing to his spectacles.\nPierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes have\nfrom which spectacles have just been removed, had also a frightened and\ninquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but with a\nrapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his lips and met\nthem with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered, unpleasantly\nexcited expression.\n“It is too late now, it’s done; besides I love her,” thought Pierre.\n“Je vous aime!” * he said, remembering what has to be said at such\nmoments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.\n* “I love you.”"}, {"page": 301, "text": "Six weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bezúkhov’s large,\nnewly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people said, of a\nwife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money."}, {"page": 302, "text": "CHAPTER III\nOld Prince Nicholas Bolkónski received a letter from Prince Vasíli in\nNovember, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him a\nvisit. “I am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I shall think\nnothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same time, my\nhonored benefactor,” wrote Prince Vasíli. “My son Anatole is\naccompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you will allow him\npersonally to express the deep respect that, emulating his father, he feels for\nyou.”\n“It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors are coming\nto us of their own accord,” incautiously remarked the little princess on\nhearing the news.\nPrince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.\nA fortnight after the letter Prince Vasíli’s servants came one evening in\nadvance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.\nOld Bolkónski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vasíli’s\ncharacter, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and\nAlexander Prince Vasíli had risen to high position and honors. And now,\nfrom the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess, he saw\nwhich way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into a\nfeeling of contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever he mentioned him.\nOn the day of Prince Vasíli’s arrival, Prince Bolkónski was particularly\ndiscontented and out of temper. Whether he was in a bad temper because\nPrince Vasíli was coming, or whether his being in a bad temper made him\nspecially annoyed at Prince Vasíli’s visit, he was in a bad temper, and in the\nmorning Tíkhon had already advised the architect not to go to the prince\nwith his report.\n“Do you hear how he’s walking?” said Tíkhon, drawing the architect’s\nattention to the sound of the prince’s footsteps. “Stepping flat on his heels—"}, {"page": 303, "text": "we know what that means....”\nHowever, at nine o’clock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable collar\nand cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed the day before and the\npath to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the habit of walking,\nhad been swept: the marks of the broom were still visible in the snow and a\nshovel had been left sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered\nboth sides of the path. The prince went through the conservatories, the\nserfs’ quarters, and the outbuildings, frowning and silent.\n“Can a sleigh pass?” he asked his overseer, a venerable man, resembling\nhis master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him back to the\nhouse.\n“The snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your honor.”\nThe prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. “God be thanked,”\nthought the overseer, “the storm has blown over!”\n“It would have been hard to drive up, your honor,” he added. “I heard,\nyour honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor.”\nThe prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him,\nfrowning.\n“What? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?” he said in his\nshrill, harsh voice. “The road is not swept for the princess my daughter, but\nfor a minister! For me, there are no ministers!”\n“Your honor, I thought...”\n“You thought!” shouted the prince, his words coming more and more\nrapidly and indistinctly. “You thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!... I’ll teach\nyou to think!” and lifting his stick he swung it and would have hit Alpátych,\nthe overseer, had not the latter instinctively avoided the blow. “Thought...\nBlackguards...” shouted the prince rapidly.\nBut although Alpátych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the\nstroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before him,\nor perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he continued to shout:\n“Blackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!” did not lift his stick\nagain but hurried into the house.\nBefore dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew\nthat the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle\nBourienne with a radiant face that said: “I know nothing, I am the same as"}, {"page": 304, "text": "usual,” and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downcast eyes. What\nshe found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she ought to\nbehave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not. She thought: “If I seem\nnot to notice he will think that I do not sympathize with him; if I seem sad\nand out of spirits myself, he will say (as he has done before) that I’m in the\ndumps.”\nThe prince looked at his daughter’s frightened face and snorted.\n“Fool... or dummy!” he muttered.\n“And the other one is not here. They’ve been telling tales,” he thought—\nreferring to the little princess who was not in the dining room.\n“Where is the princess?” he asked. “Hiding?”\n“She is not very well,” answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with a bright\nsmile, “so she won’t come down. It is natural in her state.”\n“Hm! Hm!” muttered the prince, sitting down.\nHis plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he flung it\naway. Tíkhon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little princess was\nnot unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the prince that, hearing he\nwas in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.\n“I am afraid for the baby,” she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne: “Heaven\nknows what a fright might do.”\nIn general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear, and with\na sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize because the\nfear was so much the stronger feeling. The prince reciprocated this\nantipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt for her. When the little\nprincess had grown accustomed to life at Bald Hills, she took a special\nfancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole days with her, asked her to\nsleep in her room, and often talked with her about the old prince and\ncriticized him.\n“So we are to have visitors, mon prince?” remarked Mademoiselle\nBourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. “His\nExcellency Prince Vasíli Kurágin and his son, I understand?” she said\ninquiringly.\n“Hm!—his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the\nservice,” said the prince disdainfully. “Why his son is coming I don’t\nunderstand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know. I don’t"}, {"page": 305, "text": "want him.” (He looked at his blushing daughter.) “Are you unwell today?\nEh? Afraid of the ‘minister’ as that idiot Alpátych called him this morning?”\n“No, mon père.”\nThough Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice\nof a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the conservatories\nand the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and after the soup the\nprince became more genial.\nAfter dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess was\nsitting at a small table, chattering with Másha, her maid. She grew pale on\nseeing her father-in-law.\nShe was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her cheeks\nhad sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.\n“Yes, I feel a kind of oppression,” she said in reply to the prince’s\nquestion as to how she felt.\n“Do you want anything?”\n“No, merci, mon père.”\n“Well, all right, all right.”\nHe left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpátych stood\nwith bowed head.\n“Has the snow been shoveled back?”\n“Yes, your excellency. Forgive me for heaven’s sake... It was only my\nstupidity.”\n“All right, all right,” interrupted the prince, and laughing his unnatural\nway, he stretched out his hand for Alpátych to kiss, and then proceeded to\nhis study.\nPrince Vasíli arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by\ncoachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to\none of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.\nPrince Vasíli and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.\nAnatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a\ntable on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his large\nand handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a continual round of\namusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him. And he\nlooked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly heiress in the"}, {"page": 306, "text": "same way. All this might, he thought, turn out very well and amusingly.\n“And why not marry her if she really has so much money? That never does\nany harm,” thought Anatole.\nHe shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had\nbecome habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his\nfather’s room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to him.\nPrince Vasíli’s two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked round with\nmuch animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter entered, as if\nto say: “Yes, that’s how I want you to look.”\n“I say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?” Anatole asked, as if\ncontinuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned\nduring the journey.\n“Enough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious\nwith the old prince.”\n“If he starts a row I’ll go away,” said Prince Anatole. “I can’t bear those\nold men! Eh?”\n“Remember, for you everything depends on this.”\nIn the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservants’ rooms that\nthe minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had been\nminutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room, vainly\ntrying to master her agitation.\n“Why did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never happen!”\nshe said, looking at herself in the glass. “How shall I enter the drawing\nroom? Even if I like him I can’t now be myself with him.” The mere\nthought of her father’s look filled her with terror. The little princess and\nMademoiselle Bourienne had already received from Másha, the lady’s\nmaid, the necessary report of how handsome the minister’s son was, with\nhis rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with what difficulty the father had\ndragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him like an eagle,\nthree steps at a time. Having received this information, the little princess\nand Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose chattering voices had reached her\nfrom the corridor, went into Princess Mary’s room.\n“You know they’ve come, Marie?” said the little princess, waddling in,\nand sinking heavily into an armchair."}, {"page": 307, "text": "She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning,\nbut had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her face\nwas animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded\noutlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still more\nnoticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch had\nbeen added to Mademoiselle Bourienne’s toilet which rendered her fresh\nand pretty face yet more attractive.\n“What! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?” she began.\n“They’ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we\nshall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself up at all!”\nThe little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily\nbegan to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be\ndressed. Princess Mary’s self-esteem was wounded by the fact that the\narrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both her companions’\nnot having the least conception that it could be otherwise. To tell them that\nshe felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation,\nwhile to decline their offers to dress her would prolong their banter and\ninsistence. She flushed, her beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on\nher face, and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often\nwore, as she submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both\nthese women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty. She was so plain\nthat neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they began dressing her\nwith perfect sincerity, and with the naïve and firm conviction women have\nthat dress can make a face pretty.\n“No really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,” said Lise, looking sideways\nat Princess Mary from a little distance. “You have a maroon dress, have it\nfetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life may be at stake. But\nthis one is too light, it’s not becoming!”\nIt was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary that\nwas not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little princess\nfelt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair, the\nhair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress,\nand so on, all would be well. They forgot that the frightened face and the\nfigure could not be altered, and that however they might change the setting\nand adornment of that face, it would still remain piteous and plain. After\ntwo or three changes to which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her"}, {"page": 308, "text": "hair had been arranged on the top of her head (a style that quite altered and\nspoiled her looks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf,\nthe little princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the dress\nwith her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her with her\nhead bent first on one side and then on the other.\n“No, it will not do,” she said decidedly, clasping her hands. “No, Mary,\nreally this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little gray everyday\ndress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie,” she said to the maid, “bring\nthe princess her gray dress, and you’ll see, Mademoiselle Bourienne, how I\nshall arrange it,” she added, smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure.\nBut when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained\nsitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the\nmirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst into\nsobs.\n“Come, dear princess,” said Mademoiselle Bourienne, “just one more\nlittle effort.”\nThe little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess\nMary.\n“Well, now we’ll arrange something quite simple and becoming,” she\nsaid.\nThe three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne’s, and Katie’s, who was\nlaughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping of birds.\n“No, leave me alone,” said Princess Mary.\nHer voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds\nwas silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful eyes\nfull of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at them, and\nunderstood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.\n“At least, change your coiffure,” said the little princess. “Didn’t I tell\nyou,” she went on, turning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne,\n“Mary’s is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least. Not in the\nleast! Please change it.”\n“Leave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same to me,”\nanswered a voice struggling with tears.\nMademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves\nthat Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual, but it"}, {"page": 309, "text": "was too late. She was looking at them with an expression they both knew,\nan expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess Mary did not\nfrighten them (she never inspired fear in anyone), but they knew that when\nit appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to be shaken in her\ndetermination.\n“You will change it, won’t you?” said Lise. And as Princess Mary gave\nno answer, she left the room.\nPrincess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise’s request, she\nnot only left her hair as it was, but did not even look in her glass. Letting\nher arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and pondered. A\nhusband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her\nimagination, and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own.\nShe fancied a child, her own—such as she had seen the day before in the\narms of her nurse’s daughter—at her own breast, the husband standing by\nand gazing tenderly at her and the child. “But no, it is impossible, I am too\nugly,” she thought.\n“Please come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,” came the\nmaid’s voice at the door.\nShe roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and\nbefore going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her\neyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a lamp, she\nstood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A painful doubt filled\nher soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a man, be for her? In her\nthoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of happiness and of children,\nbut her strongest, most deeply hidden longing was for earthly love. The\nmore she tried to hide this feeling from others and even from herself, the\nstronger it grew. “O God,” she said, “how am I to stifle in my heart these\ntemptations of the devil? How am I to renounce forever these vile fancies,\nso as peacefully to fulfill Thy will?” And scarcely had she put that question\nthan God gave her the answer in her own heart. “Desire nothing for thyself,\nseek nothing, be not anxious or envious. Man’s future and thy own fate\nmust remain hidden from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for\nanything. If it be God’s will to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be ready\nto fulfill His will.” With this consoling thought (but yet with a hope for the\nfulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing) Princess Mary sighed, and\nhaving crossed herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and"}, {"page": 310, "text": "coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say. What could\nall that matter in comparison with the will of God, without Whose care not\na hair of man’s head can fall?"}, {"page": 311, "text": "CHAPTER IV\nWhen Princess Mary came down, Prince Vasíli and his son were already\nin the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle\nBourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels, the\ngentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess,\nindicating her to the gentlemen, said: “Voilà Marie!” Princess Mary saw\nthem all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince Vasíli’s face, serious for an\ninstant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, and the little\nprincess curiously noting the impression “Marie” produced on the visitors.\nAnd she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and\nher unusually animated look which was fixed on him, but him she could not\nsee, she only saw something large, brilliant, and handsome moving toward\nher as she entered the room. Prince Vasíli approached first, and she kissed\nthe bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by\nsaying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well. Then Anatole\ncame up to her. She still could not see him. She only felt a soft hand taking\nhers firmly, and she touched with her lips a white forehead, over which was\nbeautiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade. When she looked up at him\nshe was struck by his beauty. Anatole stood with his right thumb under a\nbutton of his uniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn in, slightly\nswinging one foot, and, with his head a little bent, looked with beaming\nface at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at\nall. Anatole was not quick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in conversation, but\nhe had the faculty, so invaluable in society, of composure and imperturbable\nself-possession. If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first\nintroduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence\nand an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was\ndumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the princess’ hair. It was\nevident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time. “If anyone\nfinds this silence inconvenient, let him talk, but I don’t want to,” he seemed"}, {"page": 312, "text": "to say. Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner which\nparticularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even love—a supercilious\nconsciousness of his own superiority. It was as if he said to them: “I know\nyou, I know you, but why should I bother about you? You’d be only too\nglad, of course.” Perhaps he did not really think this when he met women—\neven probably he did not, for in general he thought very little—but his\nlooks and manner gave that impression. The princess felt this, and as if\nwishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him, she\nturned to his father. The conversation was general and animated, thanks to\nPrincess Lise’s voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth.\nShe met Prince Vasíli with that playful manner often employed by lively\nchatty people, and consisting in the assumption that between the person\nthey so address and themselves there are some semi-private, long-\nestablished \njokes \nand \namusing \nreminiscences, \nthough \nno \nsuch\nreminiscences really exist—just as none existed in this case. Prince Vasíli\nreadily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew Anatole, whom she\nhardly knew, into these amusing recollections of things that had never\noccurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them and even Princess\nMary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences.\n“Here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves,\ndear prince,” said the little princess (of course, in French) to Prince Vasíli.\n“It’s not as at Annette’s * receptions where you always ran away; you\nremember cette chère Annette!”\n* Anna Pávlovna.\n“Ah, but you won’t talk politics to me like Annette!”\n“And our little tea table?”\n“Oh, yes!”\n“Why is it you were never at Annette’s?” the little princess asked\nAnatole. “Ah, I know, I know,” she said with a sly glance, “your brother\nHippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!” and she shook her finger at\nhim, “I have even heard of your doings in Paris!”\n“And didn’t Hippolyte tell you?” asked Prince Vasíli, turning to his son\nand seizing the little princess’ arm as if she would have run away and he\nhad just managed to catch her, “didn’t he tell you how he himself was"}, {"page": 313, "text": "pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the door? Oh, she is a\npearl among women, Princess,” he added, turning to Princess Mary.\nWhen Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized\nthe opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.\nShe took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole had\nleft Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the\nFrenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her\nabout her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole\ncame to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either. “Not at\nall bad!” he thought, examining her, “not at all bad, that little companion! I\nhope she will bring her along with her when we’re married, la petite est\ngentille.” *\n* The little one is charming.\nThe old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering\nwhat he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. “What are\nPrince Vasíli and that son of his to me? Prince Vasíli is a shallow braggart\nand his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,” he grumbled to himself. What\nangered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an\nunsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about which he always\ndeceived himself. The question was whether he could ever bring himself to\npart from his daughter and give her to a husband. The prince never directly\nasked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he would have to\nanswer it justly, and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the\nvery possibility of life. Life without Princess Mary, little as he seemed to\nvalue her, was unthinkable to him. “And why should she marry?” he\nthought. “To be unhappy for certain. There’s Lise, married to Andrew—a\nbetter husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays—but is\nshe contented with her lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and\nawkward! They’ll take her for her connections and wealth. Are there no\nwomen living unmarried, and even the happier for it?” So thought Prince\nBolkónski while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off\ndemanded an immediate answer. Prince Vasíli had brought his son with the\nevident intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably\nask for an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. “Well,\nI’ve nothing against it,” the prince said to himself, “but he must be worthy\nof her. And that is what we shall see.”"}, {"page": 314, "text": "“That is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!” he added aloud.\nHe entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly\nround the company. He noticed the change in the little princess’ dress,\nMademoiselle Bourienne’s ribbon, Princess Mary’s unbecoming coiffure,\nMademoiselle Bourienne’s and Anatole’s smiles, and the loneliness of his\ndaughter amid the general conversation. “Got herself up like a fool!” he\nthought, looking irritably at her. “She is shameless, and he ignores her!”\nHe went straight up to Prince Vasíli.\n“Well! How d’ye do? How d’ye do? Glad to see you!”\n“Friendship laughs at distance,” began Prince Vasíli in his usual rapid,\nself-confident, familiar tone. “Here is my second son; please love and\nbefriend him.”\nPrince Bolkónski surveyed Anatole.\n“Fine young fellow! Fine young fellow!” he said. “Well, come and kiss\nme,” and he offered his cheek.\nAnatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect\ncomposure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him\nto expect.\nPrince Bolkónski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa\nand, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasíli, pointed to it and began\nquestioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen\nattentively to what Prince Vasíli said, but kept glancing at Princess Mary.\n“And so they are writing from Potsdam already?” he said, repeating\nPrince Vasíli’s last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his daughter.\n“Is it for visitors you’ve got yourself up like that, eh?” said he. “Fine,\nvery fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors, and\nbefore the visitors I tell you that in future you are never to dare to change\nyour way of dress without my consent.”\n“It was my fault, mon père,” interceded the little princess, with a blush.\n“You must do as you please,” said Prince Bolkónski, bowing to his\ndaughter-in-law, “but she need not make a fool of herself, she’s plain\nenough as it is.”\nAnd he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who\nwas reduced to tears."}, {"page": 315, "text": "“On the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,” said Prince\nVasíli.\n“Now you, young prince, what’s your name?” said Prince Bolkónski,\nturning to Anatole, “come here, let us talk and get acquainted.”\n“Now the fun begins,” thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside\nthe old prince.\n“Well, my dear boy, I hear you’ve been educated abroad, not taught to\nread and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me, my\ndear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?” asked the old man,\nscrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.\n“No, I have been transferred to the line,” said Anatole, hardly able to\nrestrain his laughter.\n“Ah! That’s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar\nand the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, are you\noff to the front?”\n“No, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached... what\nis it I am attached to, Papa?” said Anatole, turning to his father with a\nlaugh.\n“A splendid soldier, splendid! ‘What am I attached to!’ Ha, ha, ha!”\nlaughed Prince Bolkónski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly\nPrince Bolkónski frowned.\n“You may go,” he said to Anatole.\nAnatole returned smiling to the ladies.\n“And so you’ve had him educated abroad, Prince Vasíli, haven’t you?”\nsaid the old prince to Prince Vasíli.\n“I have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there is\nmuch better than ours.”\n“Yes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The lad’s\na fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.” He took Prince\nVasíli’s arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were alone together,\nPrince Vasíli announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince.\n“Well, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can’t part from her?” said\nthe old prince angrily. “What an idea! I’m ready for it tomorrow! Only let\nme tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better. You know my principles"}, {"page": 316, "text": "—everything aboveboard! I will ask her tomorrow in your presence; if she\nis willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and I’ll see.” The old prince\nsnorted. “Let her marry, it’s all the same to me!” he screamed in the same\npiercing tone as when parting from his son.\n“I will tell you frankly,” said Prince Vasíli in the tone of a crafty man\nconvinced of the futility of being cunning with so keen-sighted a\ncompanion. “You know, you see right through people. Anatole is no genius,\nbut he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent son or kinsman.”\n“All right, all right, we’ll see!”\nAs always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time\nwithout male society, on Anatole’s appearance all the three women of\nPrince Bolkónski’s household felt that their life had not been real till then.\nTheir powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately increased\ntenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in darkness, was\nsuddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.\nPrincess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The\nhandsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband\nabsorbed all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined,\nmanly, and magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dreams\nof a future family life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them\naway and tried to conceal them.\n“But am I not too cold with him?” thought the princess. “I try to be\nreserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already, but\nthen he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine that I do not like\nhim.”\nAnd Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new\nguest. “Poor girl, she’s devilish ugly!” thought Anatole.\nMademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole’s\narrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman\nwithout any definite position, without relations or even a country, did not\nintend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolkónski, to reading aloud to\nhim and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle Bourienne had\nlong been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to appreciate at a glance\nher superiority to the plain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian princesses,\nwould fall in love with her and carry her off; and here at last was a Russian\nprince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt but"}, {"page": 317, "text": "finished in her own way, which she liked to repeat to herself. It was the\nstory of a girl who had been seduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa\npauvre mère) appeared, and reproached her for yielding to a man without\nbeing married. Mademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to tears as in\nimagination she told this story to him, her seducer. And now he, a real\nRussian prince, had appeared. He would carry her away and then sa pauvre\nmère would appear and he would marry her. So her future shaped itself in\nMademoiselle Bourienne’s head at the very time she was talking to Anatole\nabout Paris. It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even for a\nmoment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar to\nher, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him\nand she wished and tried to please him as much as possible.\nThe little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet,\nunconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the familiar\ngallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any struggle, but with\nnaïve and lighthearted gaiety.\nAlthough in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man\ntired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the spectacle\nof his power over these three women. Besides that, he was beginning to feel\nfor the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne that passionate\nanimal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and\nprompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.\nAfter tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was\nasked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits, came\nand leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle Bourienne.\nPrincess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion. Her favorite\nsonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt\nupon her made that world still more poetic. But Anatole’s expression,\nthough his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but to the movements\nof Mademoiselle Bourienne’s little foot, which he was then touching with\nhis own under the clavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at\nPrincess Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and\nhope that was also new to the princess.\n“How she loves me!” thought Princess Mary. “How happy I am now, and\nhow happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband? Can"}, {"page": 318, "text": "it be possible?” she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still feeling\nhis eyes gazing at her.\nIn the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole kissed\nPrincess Mary’s hand. She did not know how she found the courage, but she\nlooked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted\neyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed Mademoiselle\nBourienne’s hand. (This was not etiquette, but then he did everything so\nsimply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and\ngave the princess a frightened look.\n“What delicacy!” thought the princess. “Is it possible that Amélie”\n(Mademoiselle Bourienne) “thinks I could be jealous of her, and not value\nher pure affection and devotion to me?” She went up to her and kissed her\nwarmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little princess’ hand.\n“No! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving\nwell I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!” she said. And smilingly\nraising a finger at him, she left the room."}, {"page": 319, "text": "CHAPTER V\nThey all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got\ninto bed, all kept awake a long time that night.\n“Is he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kind—yes, kind,\nthat is the chief thing,” thought Princess Mary; and fear, which she had\nseldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round, it seemed to\nher that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner.\nAnd this someone was he—the devil—and he was also this man with the\nwhite forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.\nShe rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.\nMademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a\nlong time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone,\nnow working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre\nmère rebuking her for her fall.\nThe little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made.\nShe could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every position was\nawkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than\never because Anatole’s presence had vividly recalled to her the time when\nshe was not like that and when everything was light and gay. She sat in an\narmchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy and\ndisheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time,\nmuttering to herself.\n“I told you it was all lumps and holes!” the little princess repeated. “I\nshould be glad enough to fall asleep, so it’s not my fault!” and her voice\nquivered like that of a child about to cry.\nThe old prince did not sleep either. Tíkhon, half asleep, heard him pacing\nangrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he had been\ninsulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed because it\nconcerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he loved more than"}, {"page": 320, "text": "himself.

They came to disturb my life—and there is not much of it\nleft.”\n“Devil take ‘em!” he muttered, while his head was still covered by the\nshirt.\nTíkhon knew his master’s habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and\ntherefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the\nface that emerged from the shirt.\n“Gone to bed?” asked the prince.\nTíkhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his\nmaster’s thoughts.

It\nseemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be\ndecided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She\nread this in Tíkhon’s face and in that of Prince Vasíli’s valet, who made her\na low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water.\nThe old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his\ndaughter that morning.

She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw Anatole\nembracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her.

Why? Wait a moment!” Anatole’s face seemed to say.\nPrincess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At last\nMademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away.

The question of how to write to Nicholas, and\nwhether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already an\nofficer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself and,\nas it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on himself?\n“I don’t know. I think if he writes, I will write too,” she said, blushing.\n“And you won’t feel ashamed to write to him?”\nSónya smiled.\n“No.”\n“And I should be ashamed to write to Borís. I’m not going to.”\n“Why should you be ashamed?”\n“Well, I don’t know. It’s awkward and would make me ashamed.”\n“And I know why she’d be ashamed,” said Pétya, offended by Natásha’s\nprevious remark. “It’s because she was in love with that fat one in\nspectacles” (that was how Pétya described his namesake, the new Count\nBezúkhov) “and now she’s in love with that singer” (he meant Natásha’s\nItalian singing master), “that’s why she’s ashamed!”\n“Pétya, you’re stupid!” said Natásha.\n“Not more stupid than you, madam,” said the nine-year-old Pétya, with\nthe air of an old brigadier.\nThe countess had been prepared by Anna Mikháylovna’s hints at dinner.\nOn retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a\nminiature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears kept\ncoming into her eyes. Anna Mikháylovna, with the letter, came on tiptoe to\nthe countess’ door and paused.\n“Don’t come in,” she said to the old count who was following her.\n“Come later.” And she went in, closing the door behind her.\nThe count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.\nAt first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna\nMikháylovna’s voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then silence, then\nboth voices together with glad intonations, and then footsteps.

Véra, Natásha, Sónya, and Pétya now entered the room, and the\nreading of the letter began. After a brief description of the campaign and the\ntwo battles in which he had taken part, and his promotion, Nicholas said\nthat he kissed his father’s and mother’s hands asking for their blessing, and\nthat he kissed Véra, Natásha, and Pétya. Besides that, he sent greetings to\nMonsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss, and his old nurse, and asked them to\nkiss for him “dear Sónya, whom he loved and thought of just the same as\never.” When she heard this Sónya blushed so that tears came into her eyes\nand, unable to bear the looks turned upon her, ran away into the dancing\nhall, whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon,\nand, flushed and smiling, plumped down on the floor. The countess was\ncrying.\n“Why are you crying, Mamma?” asked Véra. “From all he says one\nshould be glad and not cry.”\nThis was quite true, but the count, the countess, and Natásha looked at\nher reproachfully. “And who is it she takes after?” thought the countess.\nNicholas’ letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were\nconsidered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she did not let\nit out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nurses, and Dmítri, and several\nacquaintances, and the countess reread the letter each time with fresh\npleasure and each time discovered in it fresh proofs of Nikólenka’s virtues.\nHow strange, how extraordinary, how joyful it seemed, that her son, the\nscarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years\nago within her, that son about whom she used to have quarrels with the too\nindulgent count, that son who had first learned to say “pear” and then\n“granny,” that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange\nsurroundings, a manly warrior doing some kind of man’s work of his own,\nwithout help or guidance. The universal experience of ages, showing that"}, {"page": 330, "text": "children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood, did not exist\nfor the countess. Her son’s growth toward manhood, at each of its stages,\nhad seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the millions\nof human beings who grew up in the same way. As twenty years before, it\nseemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under her\nheart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to speak, so now she could\nnot believe that that little creature could be this strong, brave man, this\nmodel son and officer that, judging by this letter, he now was.\n“What a style! How charmingly he describes!” said she, reading the\ndescriptive part of the letter. “And what a soul! Not a word about himself....\nNot a word! About some Denísov or other, though he himself, I dare say, is\nbraver than any of them. He says nothing about his sufferings. What a\nheart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered everybody!

Anna Mikháylovna, practical woman\nthat she was, had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure\nadvantageous means of communication for herself and her son. She had\nopportunities of sending her letters to the Grand Duke Constantine\nPávlovich, who commanded the Guards. The Rostóvs supposed that The\nRussian Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address, and that if a letter\nreached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards there was no reason\nwhy it should not reach the Pávlograd regiment, which was presumably\nsomewhere in the same neighborhood. And so it was decided to send the\nletters and money by the Grand Duke’s courier to Borís and Borís was to\nforward them to Nicholas. The letters were from the old count, the countess,\nPétya, Véra, Natásha, and Sónya, and finally there were six thousand rubles\nfor his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son."}, {"page": 331, "text": "CHAPTER VII\nOn the twelfth of November, Kutúzov’s active army, in camp before\nOlmütz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors—the\nRussian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent the\nnight ten miles from Olmütz and next morning were to come straight to the\nreview, reaching the field at Olmütz by ten o’clock.\nThat day Nicholas Rostóv received a letter from Borís, telling him that\nthe Ismáylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olmütz\nand that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him. Rostóv\nwas particularly in need of money now that the troops, after their active\nservice, were stationed near Olmütz and the camp swarmed with well-\nprovisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts of tempting wares.\nThe Pávlograds held feast after feast, celebrating awards they had received\nfor the campaign, and made expeditions to Olmütz to visit a certain\nCaroline the Hungarian, who had recently opened a restaurant there with\ngirls as waitresses. Rostóv, who had just celebrated his promotion to a\ncornetcy and bought Denísov’s horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his\ncomrades and the sutlers. On receiving Borís’ letter he rode with a fellow\nofficer to Olmütz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone\nto the Guards’ camp to find his old playmate. Rostóv had not yet had time\nto get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with a\nsoldier’s cross, equally shabby cadet’s riding breeches lined with worn\nleather, and an officer’s saber with a sword knot. The Don horse he was\nriding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign, and he\nwore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head. As\nhe rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Borís and all his\ncomrades of the Guards by his appearance—that of a fighting hussar who\nhad been under fire.\nThe Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading\ntheir cleanliness and discipline. They had come by easy stages, their"}, {"page": 332, "text": "knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided\nexcellent dinners for the officers at every halting place. The regiments had\nentered and left the town with their bands playing, and by the Grand Duke’s\norders the men had marched all the way in step (a practice on which the\nGuards prided themselves), the officers on foot and at their proper posts.\nBorís had been quartered, and had marched all the way, with Berg who was\nalready in command of a company. Berg, who had obtained his captaincy\nduring the campaign, had gained the confidence of his superiors by his\npromptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very\nsatisfactorily. Borís, during the campaign, had made the acquaintance of\nmany persons who might prove useful to him, and by a letter of\nrecommendation he had brought from Pierre had become acquainted with\nPrince Andrew Bolkónski, through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the\ncommander in chief’s staff. Berg and Borís, having rested after yesterday’s\nmarch, were sitting, clean and neatly dressed, at a round table in the clean\nquarters allotted to them, playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between\nhis knees. Borís, in the accurate way characteristic of him, was building a\nlittle pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting\nBerg’s move, and watched his opponent’s face, evidently thinking about the\ngame as he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on.\n“Well, how are you going to get out of that?” he remarked.\n“We’ll try to,” replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing his\nhand.\nAt that moment the door opened.\n“Here he is at last!” shouted Rostóv. “And Berg too! Oh, you petisenfans,\nallay cushay dormir!” he exclaimed, imitating his Russian nurse’s French,\nat which he and Borís used to laugh long ago.\n“Dear me, how you have changed!”\nBorís rose to meet Rostóv, but in doing so did not omit to steady and\nreplace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace his\nfriend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of youth, that\ndread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a manner different from\nthat of its elders which is often insincere, Nicholas wished to do something\nspecial on meeting his friend. He wanted to pinch him, push him, do\nanything but kiss him—a thing everybody did. But notwithstanding this,\nBorís embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and kissed him three times."}, {"page": 333, "text": "They had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young\nmen take their first steps on life’s road, each saw immense changes in the\nother, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those\nfirst steps. Both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a\nhurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.\n“Oh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if you’d been to a fete, not\nlike us sinners of the line,” cried Rostóv, with martial swagger and with\nbaritone notes in his voice, new to Borís, pointing to his own mud-\nbespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing Rostóv’s loud voice,\npopped her head in at the door.\n“Eh, is she pretty?” he asked with a wink.\n“Why do you shout so? You’ll frighten them!” said Borís. “I did not\nexpect you today,” he added. “I only sent you the note yesterday by\nBolkónski—an adjutant of Kutúzov’s, who’s a friend of mine. I did not\nthink he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you? Been under\nfire already?” asked Borís.\nWithout answering, Rostóv shook the soldier’s Cross of St. George\nfastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm,\nglanced at Berg with a smile.\n“As you see,” he said.\n“Indeed? Yes, yes!” said Borís, with a smile. “And we too have had a\nsplendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode with\nour regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and every\nadvantage. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and balls!

I can tell\nyou for myself...”\n“I say, Berg, my dear fellow,” said Rostóv, “when you get a letter from\nhome and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything\nover with, and I happen to be there, I’ll go at once, to be out of your way!\nDo go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!” he exclaimed, and\nimmediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face,\nevidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words, he added, “Don’t be\nhurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak from my heart as to an old\nacquaintance.”\n“Oh, don’t mention it, Count! I quite understand,” said Berg, getting up\nand speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.\n“Go across to our hosts: they invited you,” added Borís.\nBerg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust, stood\nbefore a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards, in the\nway affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having assured himself from\nthe way Rostóv looked at it that his coat had been noticed, left the room\nwith a pleasant smile.\n“Oh dear, what a beast I am!” muttered Rostóv, as he read the letter.\n“Why?”\n“Oh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them such a\nfright! Oh, what a pig I am!” he repeated, flushing suddenly. “Well, have\nyou sent Gabriel for some wine?

But that’s not the point... Come,\nhow are you?” asked Rostóv.\n“Well, as you see. So far everything’s all right, but I confess I should\nmuch like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front.”\n“Why?”\n“Because when once a man starts on military service, he should try to\nmake as successful a career of it as possible.”\n“Oh, that’s it!” said Rostóv, evidently thinking of something else.\nHe looked intently and inquiringly into his friend’s eyes, evidently trying\nin vain to find the answer to some question.\nOld Gabriel brought in the wine.\n“Shouldn’t we now send for Berg?” asked Borís. “He would drink with\nyou.

Berg returned,\nand over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became\nanimated. The Guardsmen told Rostóv of their march and how they had\nbeen made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke of the\nsayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told stories of\nhis kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, kept silent when the subject did\nnot relate to himself, but in connection with the stories of the Grand Duke’s\nquick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he had managed to deal\nwith the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was\nannoyed at the irregularity of a movement.

Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army\nOrders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lord’s Prayer.\nSo, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and so my\nconscience was at ease. I came forward....” (Berg stood up and showed how\nhe presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really it would have\nbeen difficult for a face to express greater respect and self-complacency\nthan his did.) “Well, he stormed at me, as the saying is, stormed and\nstormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but rather of death, as the\nsaying is. ‘Albanians!’ and ‘devils!’ and ‘To Siberia!’” said Berg with a\nsagacious smile. “I knew I was in the right so I kept silent; was not that\nbest, Count?... ‘Hey, are you dumb?’ he shouted. Still I remained silent. And\nwhat do you think, Count? The next day it was not even mentioned in the\nOrders of the Day. That’s what keeping one’s head means. That’s the way,\nCount,” said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke.\n“Yes, that was fine,” said Rostóv, smiling.\nBut Borís noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and\nskillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where he\ngot his wound. This pleased Rostóv and he began talking about it, and as he\nwent on became more and more animated. He told them of his Schön\nGrabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do\ndescribe it, that is, as they would like it to have been, as they have heard it\ndescribed by others, and as sounds well, but not at all as it really was.\nRostóv was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a\ndeliberate lie. He began his story meaning to tell everything just as it\nhappened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily, and inevitably he lapsed into\nfalsehood. If he had told the truth to his hearers—who like himself had\noften heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an\nattack was and were expecting to hear just such a story—they would either\nnot have believed him or, still worse, would have thought that Rostóv was\nhimself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry\nattacks had not happened to him. He could not tell them simply that\neveryone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm\nand then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides,"}, {"page": 337, "text": "to tell everything as it really happened, it would have been necessary to\nmake an effort of will to tell only what happened.

And so he\ntold them all that.\nIn the middle of his story, just as he was saying: “You cannot imagine\nwhat a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,” Prince Andrew,\nwhom Borís was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who liked to\nhelp young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being\nwell disposed toward Borís, who had managed to please him the day before,\nhe wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent with papers\nfrom Kutúzov to the Tsarévich, he looked in on Borís, hoping to find him\nalone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his\nmilitary exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man), he\ngave Borís a pleasant smile, frowned as with half-closed eyes he looked at\nRostóv, bowed slightly and wearily, and sat down languidly on the sofa: he\nfelt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company. Rostóv flushed up on\nnoticing this, but he did not care, this was a mere stranger. Glancing,\nhowever, at Borís, he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the\nline.\nIn spite of Prince Andrew’s disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of the\ncontempt with which Rostóv, from his fighting army point of view, regarded\nall these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently\none, Rostóv felt confused, blushed, and became silent. Borís inquired what\nnews there might be on the staff, and what, without indiscretion, one might\nask about our plans.\n“We shall probably advance,” replied Bolkónski, evidently reluctant to\nsay more in the presence of a stranger.\nBerg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was\nrumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be\ndoubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could give no\nopinion on such an important government order, and Berg laughed gaily.\n“As to your business,” Prince Andrew continued, addressing Borís, “we\nwill talk of it later” (and he looked round at Rostóv). “Come to me after the"}, {"page": 338, "text": "review and we will do what is possible.”\nAnd, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to Rostóv,\nwhose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to\nanger he did not condescend to notice, and said: “I think you were talking\nof the Schön Grabern affair? Were you there?”\n“I was there,” said Rostóv angrily, as if intending to insult the aide-de-\ncamp.\nBolkónski noticed the hussar’s state of mind, and it amused him. With a\nslightly contemptuous smile, he said: “Yes, there are many stories now told\nabout that affair!”\n“Yes, stories!” repeated Rostóv loudly, looking with eyes suddenly grown\nfurious, now at Borís, now at Bolkónski. “Yes, many stories! But our stories\nare the stories of men who have been under the enemy’s fire! Our stories\nhave some weight, not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get\nrewards without doing anything!”\n“Of whom you imagine me to be one?” said Prince Andrew, with a quiet\nand particularly amiable smile.\nA strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man’s self-\npossession mingled at that moment in Rostóv’s soul.\n“I am not talking about you,” he said, “I don’t know you and, frankly, I\ndon’t want to. I am speaking of the staff in general.”\n“And I will tell you this,” Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet\nauthority, “you wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with you that it\nwould be very easy to do so if you haven’t sufficient self-respect, but admit\nthat the time and place are very badly chosen. In a day or two we shall all\nhave to take part in a greater and more serious duel, and besides,\nDrubetskóy, who says he is an old friend of yours, is not at all to blame that\nmy face has the misfortune to displease you.

The two Emperors, the\nRussian with his heir the Tsarévich, and the Austrian with the Archduke,\ninspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.\nFrom early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up\non the field before the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets moved\nand halted at the officers’ command, turned with banners flying, formed up\nat intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of infantry in different\nuniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling of\nshowy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided uniforms, with smartly\ndressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan, or gray horses; then\nagain, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining cannon\nthat quivered on the gun carriages and with the smell of linstocks, came the\nartillery which crawled between the infantry and cavalry and took up its\nappointed position. Not only the generals in full parade uniforms, with their\nthin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into\ntheir stiff collars, and wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the\nelegant, pomaded officers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and\nshaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and every\nhorse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane\nlay smooth—felt that no small matter was happening, but an important and\nsolemn affair. Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own\ninsignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and yet at\nthe same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous\nwhole.\nFrom early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten\no’clock all had been brought into due order. The ranks were drawn up on"}, {"page": 341, "text": "the vast field. The whole army was extended in three lines: the cavalry in\nfront, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the infantry.\nA space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. The three\nparts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kutúzov’s fighting army\n(with the Pávlograds on the right flank of the front); those recently arrived\nfrom Russia, both Guards and regiments of the line; and the Austrian\ntroops. But they all stood in the same lines, under one command, and in a\nlike order.\nLike wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: “They’re coming! They’re\ncoming!” Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final preparation swept\nover all the troops.\nFrom the direction of Olmütz in front of them, a group was seen\napproaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust of\nwind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and\nthe unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. It looked as if by that\nslight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the\nEmperors. One voice was heard shouting: “Eyes front!” Then, like the\ncrowing of cocks at sunrise, this was repeated by others from various sides\nand all became silent.\nIn the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard. This was the\nEmperors’ suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the trumpets of\nthe first cavalry regiment played the general march. It seemed as though not\nthe trumpeters were playing, but as if the army itself, rejoicing at the\nEmperors’ approach, had naturally burst into music. Amid these sounds,\nonly the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor Alexander was clearly heard.\nHe gave the words of greeting, and the first regiment roared “Hurrah!” so\ndeafeningly, continuously, and joyfully that the men themselves were awed\nby their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted.\nRostóv, standing in the front lines of Kutúzov’s army which the Tsar\napproached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in that\narmy: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of might, and a\npassionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph.\nHe felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass (and he\nhimself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water,\ncommit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could\nnot but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word."}, {"page": 342, "text": "“Hurrah!

Hurrah!” growing\never stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.\nTill the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility\nseemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive, its\nthunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already\npassed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices, amid the\nsquare masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone, hundreds\nof riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and\nabove all freely, and in front of them two men—the Emperors. Upon them\nthe undivided, tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was\nconcentrated.\nThe handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse\nGuards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his\npleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone’s\nattention.\nRostóv was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had\nrecognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty\npaces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome,\nhappy young face, he experienced a feeling of tenderness and ecstasy such\nas he had never before known. Every trait and every movement of the\nTsar’s seemed to him enchanting.\nStopping in front of the Pávlograds, the Tsar said something in French to\nthe Austrian Emperor and smiled.\nSeeing that smile, Rostóv involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still\nstronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in some\nway and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar called\nthe colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.\n“Oh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?”\nthought Rostóv. “I should die of happiness!”\nThe Tsar addressed the officers also: “I thank you all, gentlemen, I thank\nyou with my whole heart.” To Rostóv every word sounded like a voice from\nheaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!"}, {"page": 343, "text": "“You have earned the St. George’s standards and will be worthy of\nthem.”\n“Oh, to die, to die for him,” thought Rostóv.\nThe Tsar said something more which Rostóv did not hear, and the\nsoldiers, straining their lungs, shouted “Hurrah!”\nRostóv too, bending over his saddle, shouted “Hurrah!” with all his\nmight, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if only to\nexpress his rapture fully.\nThe Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.\n“How can the Emperor be undecided?” thought Rostóv, but then even\nthis indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything\nelse the Tsar did.\nThat hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar’s foot, in the narrow\npointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare\nhe rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he moved off\naccompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp. Farther and\nfarther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at last only his white\nplumes were visible to Rostóv from amid the suites that surrounded the\nEmperors.\nAmong the gentlemen of the suite, Rostóv noticed Bolkónski, sitting his\nhorse indolently and carelessly. Rostóv recalled their quarrel of yesterday\nand the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not to challenge\nBolkónski. “Of course not!” he now thought. “Is it worth thinking or\nspeaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such love, such rapture, and\nsuch self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter? I love\nand forgive everybody now.”\nWhen the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began\na ceremonial march past him, and Rostóv on Bedouin, recently purchased\nfrom Denísov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadron—that is, alone and\nin full view of the Emperor.\nBefore he reached him, Rostóv, who was a splendid horseman, spurred\nBedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the\nanimal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his tail\nextended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperor’s eye upon him,"}, {"page": 344, "text": "passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful action, as if\nflying through the air without touching the ground.\nRostóv himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling\nhimself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but\nblissful face “like a vewy devil,” as Denísov expressed it.\n“Fine fellows, the Pávlograds!” remarked the Emperor.\n“My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire\nthis instant!” thought Rostóv.\nWhen the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also\nKutúzov’s, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards, about\nthe Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about Bonaparte, and\nhow badly the latter would fare now, especially if the Essen corps arrived\nand Prussia took our side.\nBut the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander. His\nevery word and movement was described with ecstasy.\nThey all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the\nenemy under the Emperor’s command. Commanded by the Emperor\nhimself they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might: so\nthought Rostóv and most of the officers after the review.\nAll were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles\nwould have made them."}, {"page": 345, "text": "CHAPTER IX\nThe day after the review, Borís, in his best uniform and with his comrade\nBerg’s best wishes for success, rode to Olmütz to see Bolkónski, wishing to\nprofit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he could—\npreferably that of adjutant to some important personage, a position in the\narmy which seemed to him most attractive. “It is all very well for Rostóv,\nwhose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time, to talk about not\nwishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone’s lackey, but I who have\nnothing but my brains have to make a career and must not miss\nopportunities, but must avail myself of them!” he reflected.\nHe did not find Prince Andrew in Olmütz that day, but the appearance of\nthe town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed\nand the two Emperors were living with their suites, households, and courts\nonly strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world.\nHe knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsman’s uniform, all these\nexalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages with their\nplumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military men, seemed so\nimmeasurably above him, an insignificant officer of the Guards, that they\nnot only did not wish to, but simply could not, be aware of his existence. At\nthe quarters of the commander in chief, Kutúzov, where he inquired for\nBolkónski, all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as if they\nwished to impress on him that a great many officers like him were always\ncoming there and that everybody was heartily sick of them. In spite of this,\nor rather because of it, next day, November 15, after dinner he again went to\nOlmütz and, entering the house occupied by Kutúzov, asked for Bolkónski.\nPrince Andrew was in and Borís was shown into a large hall probably\nformerly used for dancing, but in which five beds now stood, and furniture\nof various kinds: a table, chairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, nearest the\ndoor, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing. Another,\nthe red, stout Nesvítski, lay on a bed with his arms under his head, laughing"}, {"page": 346, "text": "with an officer who had sat down beside him. A third was playing a\nViennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on the clavichord,\nsang the tune. Bolkónski was not there. None of these gentlemen changed\nhis position on seeing Borís. The one who was writing and whom Borís\naddressed turned round crossly and told him Bolkónski was on duty and\nthat he should go through the door on the left into the reception room if he\nwished to see him. Borís thanked him and went to the reception room,\nwhere he found some ten officers and generals.\nWhen he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously\n(with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, “If it\nwere not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment”), was listening to\nan old Russian general with decorations, who stood very erect, almost on\ntiptoe, with a soldier’s obsequious expression on his purple face, reporting\nsomething.\n“Very well, then, be so good as to wait,” said Prince Andrew to the\ngeneral, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected when\nhe wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Borís, Prince Andrew,\npaying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear\nsomething more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile.\nAt that moment Borís clearly realized what he had before surmised, that\nin the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the\nmilitary code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was\nanother, more important, subordination, which made this tight-laced,\npurple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for his\nown pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetskóy. More than ever\nwas Borís resolved to serve in future not according to the written code, but\nunder this unwritten law. He felt now that merely by having been\nrecommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general who\nat the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the Guards.\nPrince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.\n“I am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing about\nwith Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions.\nWhen Germans start being accurate, there’s no end to it!”\nBorís smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to as\nsomething generally known. But it was the first time he had heard\nWeyrother’s name, or even the term “dispositions.”"}, {"page": 347, "text": "“Well, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have been\nthinking about you.”\n“Yes, I was thinking”—for some reason Borís could not help blushing\n—“of asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter from Prince\nKurágin about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards won’t be\nin action,” he added as if in apology.\n“All right, all right. We’ll talk it over,” replied Prince Andrew. “Only let\nme report this gentleman’s business, and I shall be at your disposal.”\nWhile Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that\ngentleman—evidently not sharing Borís’ conception of the advantages of\nthe unwritten code of subordination—looked so fixedly at the presumptuous\nlieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to say to the\nadjutant that Borís felt uncomfortable. He turned away and waited\nimpatiently for Prince Andrew’s return from the commander in chief’s\nroom.\n“You see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you,” said Prince\nAndrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was.\n“It’s no use your going to the commander in chief. He would say a lot of\npleasant things, ask you to dinner” (“That would not be bad as regards the\nunwritten code,” thought Borís), “but nothing more would come of it. There\nwill soon be a battalion of us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what\nwe’ll do: I have a good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow,\nPrince Dolgorúkov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now\nKutúzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing. Everything is now\ncentered round the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgorúkov; I have to go\nthere anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you. We shall see\nwhether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere\nnearer the sun.”\nPrince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a\nyoung man and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining help\nof this kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for\nhimself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which\nattracted him. He very readily took up Borís’ cause and went with him to\nDolgorúkov.\nIt was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmütz\noccupied by the Emperors and their retinues."}, {"page": 348, "text": "That same day a council of war had been held in which all the members\nof the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that council, contrary\nto the views of the old generals Kutúzov and Prince Schwartzenberg, it had\nbeen decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte. The\ncouncil of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied by Borís\narrived at the palace to find Dolgorúkov. Everyone at headquarters was still\nunder the spell of the day’s council, at which the party of the young had\ntriumphed. The voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting\nfor something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and\ntheir arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages of\nattacking that what had been discussed at the council—the coming battle\nand the victory that would certainly result from it—no longer seemed to be\nin the future but in the past. All the advantages were on our side. Our\nenormous forces, undoubtedly superior to Napoleon’s, were concentrated in\none place, the troops inspired by the Emperors’ presence were eager for\naction. The strategic position where the operations would take place was\nfamiliar in all its details to the Austrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident\nhad ordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on\nthe very fields where the French had now to be fought; the adjacent locality\nwas known and shown in every detail on the maps, and Bonaparte,\nevidently weakened, was undertaking nothing.\nDolgorúkov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just returned\nfrom the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory that\nhad been gained. Prince Andrew introduced his protégé, but Prince\nDolgorúkov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to Borís and,\nevidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his\nmind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew in French.\n“Ah, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that the\none that will result from it will be as victorious! However, dear fellow,” he\nsaid abruptly and eagerly, “I must confess to having been unjust to the\nAustrians and especially to Weyrother. What exactitude, what minuteness,\nwhat knowledge of the locality, what foresight for every eventuality, every\npossibility even to the smallest detail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions\nbetter than our present ones could have been devised. This combination of\nAustrian precision with Russian valor—what more could be wished for?”\n“So the attack is definitely resolved on?” asked Bolkónski."}, {"page": 349, "text": "“And do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has\ndecidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received from him today\nfor the Emperor.” Dolgorúkov smiled significantly.\n“Is that so? And what did he say?” inquired Bolkónski.\n“What can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain time. I tell\nyou he is in our hands, that’s certain! But what was most amusing,” he\ncontinued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, “was that we could not think\nhow to address the reply! If not as ‘Consul’ and of course not as ‘Emperor,’\nit seemed to me it should be to ‘General Bonaparte.’”\n“But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General\nBonaparte, there is a difference,” remarked Bolkónski.\n“That’s just it,” interrupted Dolgorúkov quickly, laughing. “You know\nBilíbin—he’s a very clever fellow. He suggested addressing him as\n‘Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.’”\nDolgorúkov laughed merrily.\n“Only that?” said Bolkónski.\n“All the same, it was Bilíbin who found a suitable form for the address.\nHe is a wise and clever fellow.”\n“What was it?”\n“To the Head of the French Government... Au chef du gouvernement\nfrançais,” said Dolgorúkov, with grave satisfaction. “Good, wasn’t it?”\n“Yes, but he will dislike it extremely,” said Bolkónski.\n“Oh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he’s dined with him—the\npresent Emperor—more than once in Paris, and tells me he never met a\nmore cunning or subtle diplomatist—you know, a combination of French\nadroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale about him and\nCount Markóv? Count Markóv was the only man who knew how to handle\nhim. You know the story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!”\nAnd the talkative Dolgorúkov, turning now to Borís, now to Prince\nAndrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test Markóv, our ambassador,\npurposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at\nMarkóv, probably expecting Markóv to pick it up for him, and how Markóv\nimmediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching\nBonaparte’s."}, {"page": 350, "text": "“Delightful!” said Bolkónski. “But I have come to you, Prince, as a\npetitioner on behalf of this young man. You see...” but before Prince\nAndrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon Dolgorúkov to\nthe Emperor.\n“Oh, what a nuisance,” said Dolgorúkov, getting up hurriedly and\npressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Borís. “You know I should be\nvery glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young man.”\nAgain he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of good-natured,\nsincere, and animated levity. “But you see... another time!”\nBorís was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers\nas he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious that here he was\nin contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of\nthe mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny, obedient, and\ninsignificant atom. They followed Prince Dolgorúkov out into the corridor\nand met—coming out of the door of the Emperor’s room by which\nDolgorúkov had entered—a short man in civilian clothes with a clever face\nand sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling his face, gave him a\npeculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression. This short man nodded to\nDolgorúkov as to an intimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool\nintensity, walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow\nor to step out of his way. Prince Andrew did neither: a look of animosity\nappeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the side of\nthe corridor.\n“Who was that?” asked Borís.\n“He is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of men—\nthe Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartorýski.... It is such men\nas he who decide the fate of nations,” added Bolkónski with a sigh he could\nnot suppress, as they passed out of the palace.\nNext day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of\nAusterlitz, Borís was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgorúkov\nagain and remained for a while with the Ismáylov regiment."}, {"page": 351, "text": "CHAPTER X\nAt dawn on the sixteenth of November, Denísov’s squadron, in which\nNicholas Rostóv served and which was in Prince Bagratión’s detachment,\nmoved from the place where it had spent the night, advancing into action as\narranged, and after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a\nmile was stopped on the highroad. Rostóv saw the Cossacks and then the\nfirst and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery\npass by and go forward and then Generals Bagratión and Dolgorúkov ride\npast with their adjutants. All the fear before action which he had\nexperienced as previously, all the inner struggle to conquer that fear, all his\ndreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle, had been\nwasted. Their squadron remained in reserve and Nicholas Rostóv spent that\nday in a dull and wretched mood. At nine in the morning, he heard firing in\nfront and shouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought back (there\nwere not many of them), and at last he saw how a whole detachment of\nFrench cavalry was brought in, convoyed by a sótnya of Cossacks.\nEvidently the affair was over and, though not big, had been a successful\nengagement. The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory, of\nthe occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French\nsquadron. The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and the\ncheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory\nwhich was conveyed, not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it,\nbut also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals,\nand adjutants, as they passed Rostóv going or coming. And Nicholas, who\nhad vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that\nhappy day in inactivity, was all the more depressed.\n“Come here, Wostóv. Let’s dwink to dwown our gwief!” shouted\nDenísov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food.\nThe officers gathered round Denísov’s canteen, eating and talking."}, {"page": 352, "text": "“There! They are bringing another!” cried one of the officers, indicating a\ncaptive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two Cossacks.\nOne of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had\ntaken from the prisoner.\n“Sell us that horse!” Denísov called out to the Cossacks.\n“If you like, your honor!”\nThe officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner. The\nFrench dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German\naccent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when he\nheard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers,\naddressing first one, then another. He said he would not have been taken, it\nwas not his fault but the corporal’s who had sent him to seize some\nhorsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were there. And at every\nword he added: “But don’t hurt my little horse!” and stroked the animal. It\nwas plain that he did not quite grasp where he was. Now he excused himself\nfor having been taken prisoner and now, imagining himself before his own\nofficers, insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the service. He\nbrought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the\nFrench army, which was so alien to us.\nThe Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rostóv, being the\nrichest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.\n“But don’t hurt my little horse!” said the Alsatian good-naturedly to\nRostóv when the animal was handed over to the hussar.\nRostóv smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.\n“Alley! Alley!” said the Cossack, touching the prisoner’s arm to make\nhim go on.\n“The Emperor! The Emperor!” was suddenly heard among the hussars.\nAll began to run and bustle, and Rostóv saw coming up the road behind\nhim several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment everyone\nwas in his place, waiting.\nRostóv did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted.\nInstantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood amid\npeople of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought of himself\nhad vanished.

He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of\nthe approaching cavalcade, but because as he drew near everything grew\nbrighter, more joyful, more significant, and more festive around him.\nNearer and nearer to Rostóv came that sun shedding beams of mild and\nmajestic light around, and already he felt himself enveloped in those beams,\nhe heard his voice, that kindly, calm, and majestic voice that was yet so\nsimple! And as if in accord with Rostóv’s feeling, there was a deathly\nstillness amid which was heard the Emperor’s voice.\n“The Pávlograd hussars?” he inquired.\n“The reserves, sire!” replied a voice, a very human one compared to that\nwhich had said: “The Pávlograd hussars?”\nThe Emperor drew level with Rostóv and halted. Alexander’s face was\neven more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review. It\nshone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested the\nliveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face of the majestic\nEmperor. Casually, while surveying the squadron, the Emperor’s eyes met\nRostóv’s and rested on them for not more than two seconds. Whether or no\nthe Emperor understood what was going on in Rostóv’s soul (it seemed to\nRostóv that he understood everything), at any rate his light-blue eyes gazed\nfor about two seconds into Rostóv’s face. A gentle, mild light poured from\nthem. Then all at once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse\nwith his left foot, and galloped on.\nThe younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the\nbattle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve o’clock\nleft the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the\nvanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, several adjutants met him\nwith news of the successful result of the action.\nThis battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was\nrepresented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the Emperor and\nthe whole army, especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield,\nbelieved that the French had been defeated and were retreating against their\nwill. A few minutes after the Emperor had passed, the Pávlograd division\nwas ordered to advance. In Wischau itself, a petty German town, Rostóv\nsaw the Emperor again.

The Emperor,\nsurrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed\nchestnut mare, a different one from that which he had ridden at the review,\nand bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and\nlooked at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The\nwounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity to the\nEmperor shocked Rostóv. Rostóv saw how the Emperor’s rather round\nshoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his left\nfoot began convulsively tapping the horse’s side with the spur, and how the\nwell-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir. An adjutant,\ndismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on a stretcher\nthat had been brought. The soldier groaned.\n“Gently, gently! Can’t you do it more gently?” said the Emperor\napparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.\nRostóv saw tears filling the Emperor’s eyes and heard him, as he was\nriding away, say to Czartorýski: “What a terrible thing war is: what a\nterrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!”\nThe troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight\nof the enemy’s lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us at the\nleast firing. The Emperor’s gratitude was announced to the vanguard,\nrewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of vodka. The\ncampfires crackled and the soldiers’ songs resounded even more merrily\nthan on the previous night. Denísov celebrated his promotion to the rank of\nmajor, and Rostóv, who had already drunk enough, at the end of the feast\nproposed the Emperor’s health. “Not ‘our Sovereign, the Emperor,’ as they\nsay at official dinners,” said he, “but the health of our Sovereign, that good,\nenchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his health and to the certain\ndefeat of the French!”\n“If we fought before,” he said, “not letting the French pass, as at Schön\nGrabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front?

At headquarters and among the\ntroops near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing\nand had slept badly that night, those around him reported. The cause of this\nindisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by the\nsight of the killed and wounded.\nAt daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with a\nflag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was\nbrought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The\nEmperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At midday\nhe was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with Prince\nDolgorúkov to the advanced post of the French army.\nIt was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander a\nmeeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, a personal\ninterview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince Dolgorúkov, the\nvictor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon if,\ncontrary to expectations, these negotiations were actuated by a real desire\nfor peace.\nToward evening Dolgorúkov came back, went straight to the Tsar, and\nremained alone with him for a long time.\nOn the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced two\ndays’ march and the enemy’s outposts after a brief interchange of shots\nretreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth, a\ngreat, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning of the\ntwentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz was fought.\nTill midday on the nineteenth, the activity—the eager talk, running to and\nfro, and dispatching of adjutants—was confined to the Emperor’s\nheadquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this activity reached"}, {"page": 357, "text": "Kutúzov’s headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns. By\nevening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army, and in\nthe night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole eighty thousand\nallied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices, and the army\nswayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long.\nThe concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperor’s headquarters\nin the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like\nthe first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock. One wheel\nslowly moved, another was set in motion, and a third, and wheels began to\nrevolve faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to work, chimes to play,\nfigures to pop out, and the hands to advance with regular motion as a result\nof all that activity.\nJust as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military\nmachine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as\nindifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them\nare the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached.\nWheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the\nrevolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a\nneighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to\nremain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever\ncatches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in\nthe common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.\nJust as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable\nwheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands\nwhich show the time, so the result of all the complicated human activities of\n160,000 Russians and French—all their passions, desires, remorse,\nhumiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and enthusiasm—was only\nthe loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the so-called battle of the three Emperors\n—that is to say, a slow movement of the hand on the dial of human history.\nPrince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the\ncommander in chief.\nAt six in the evening, Kutúzov went to the Emperor’s headquarters and\nafter staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand marshal of\nthe court, Count Tolstóy.\nBolkónski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming\naction from Dolgorúkov. He felt that Kutúzov was upset and dissatisfied"}, {"page": 358, "text": "about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him,\nand also that at the Emperor’s headquarters everyone adopted toward him\nthe tone of men who know something others do not know: he therefore\nwished to speak to Dolgorúkov.\n“Well, how d’you do, my dear fellow?” said Dolgorúkov, who was sitting\nat tea with Bilíbin. “The fete is for tomorrow. How is your old fellow? Out\nof sorts?”\n“I won’t say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be heard.”\n“But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he\ntalks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte\nfears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible.”\n“Yes, you have seen him?” said Prince Andrew. “Well, what is Bonaparte\nlike? How did he impress you?”\n“Yes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a\ngeneral engagement,” repeated Dolgorúkov, evidently prizing this general\nconclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with Napoleon. “If\nhe weren’t afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview? Why\nnegotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his\nmethod of conducting war? Believe me, he is afraid, afraid of a general\nbattle. His hour has come! Mark my words!”\n“But tell me, what is he like, eh?” said Prince Andrew again.\n“He is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call him\n‘Your Majesty,’ but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me! That’s the sort\nof man he is, and nothing more,” replied Dolgorúkov, looking round at\nBilíbin with a smile.\n“Despite my great respect for old Kutúzov,” he continued, “we should be\na nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance to\nescape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in our hands! No, we\nmustn’t forget Suvórov and his rule—not to put yourself in a position to be\nattacked, but yourself to attack. Believe me in war the energy of young men\noften shows the way better than all the experience of old Cunctators.”\n“But in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the\noutposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are\nsituated,” said Prince Andrew."}, {"page": 359, "text": "He wished to explain to Dolgorúkov a plan of attack he had himself\nformed.\n“Oh, that is all the same,” Dolgorúkov said quickly, and getting up he\nspread a map on the table. “All eventualities have been foreseen. If he is\nstanding before Brünn...”\nAnd Prince Dolgorúkov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother’s\nplan of a flanking movement.\nPrince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which might\nhave been as good as Weyrother’s, but for the disadvantage that\nWeyrother’s had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrew began\nto demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan,\nPrince Dolgorúkov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not at\nthe map, but at Prince Andrew’s face.\n“There will be a council of war at Kutúzov’s tonight, though; you can say\nall this there,” remarked Dolgorúkov.\n“I will do so,” said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.\n“Whatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?” said Bilíbin, who, till\nthen, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now was\nevidently ready with a joke. “Whether tomorrow brings victory or defeat,\nthe glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except your Kutúzov, there is not a\nsingle Russian in command of a column! The commanders are: Herr\nGeneral Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de Lichtenstein, le\nPrince de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on like all those Polish\nnames.”\n“Be quiet, backbiter!” said Dolgorúkov. “It is not true; there are now two\nRussians, Milorádovich, and Dokhtúrov, and there would be a third, Count\nArakchéev, if his nerves were not too weak.”\n“However, I think General Kutúzov has come out,” said Prince Andrew.\n“I wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!” he added and went out\nafter shaking hands with Dolgorúkov and Bilíbin.\nOn the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kutúzov,\nwho was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of tomorrow’s battle.\nKutúzov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied: “I think\nthe battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolstóy and asked him to tell the\nEmperor.

All the\ncommanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chief’s and\nwith the exception of Prince Bagratión, who declined to come, were all\nthere at the appointed time.\nWeyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his\neagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and\ndrowsy Kutúzov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president\nof the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt himself to be at the head of a\nmovement that had already become unrestrainable. He was like a horse\nrunning downhill harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was pulling it or\nbeing pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at headlong speed\nwith no time to consider what this movement might lead to. Weyrother had\nbeen twice that evening to the enemy’s picket line to reconnoiter personally,\nand twice to the Emperors, Russian and Austrian, to report and explain, and\nto his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in German, and\nnow, much exhausted, he arrived at Kutúzov’s.\nHe was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the\ncommander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly,\nwithout looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to\nquestions put to him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful, weary,\nand distracted air, though at the same time he was haughty and self-\nconfident.\nKutúzov was occupying a nobleman’s castle of modest dimensions near\nOstralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the commander in\nchief’s office were gathered Kutúzov himself, Weyrother, and the members\nof the council of war. They were drinking tea, and only awaited Prince\nBagratión to begin the council. At last Bagratión’s orderly came with the\nnews that the prince could not attend. Prince Andrew came in to inform the"}, {"page": 362, "text": "commander in chief of this and, availing himself of permission previously\ngiven him by Kutúzov to be present at the council, he remained in the room.\n“Since Prince Bagratión is not coming, we may begin,” said Weyrother,\nhurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an\nenormous map of the environs of Brünn was spread out.\nKutúzov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his\ncollar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair, with his\npodgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound of\nWeyrother’s voice, he opened his one eye with an effort.\n“Yes, yes, if you please! It is already late,” said he, and nodding his head\nhe let it droop and again closed his eye.\nIf at first the members of the council thought that Kutúzov was\npretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that\nfollowed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed\nby a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the\ndispositions or anything else—he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible\nhuman need for sleep. He really was asleep. Weyrother, with the gesture of\na man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kutúzov and, having\nconvinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in a loud,\nmonotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending\nbattle, under a heading which he also read out:\n“Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and\nSokolnitz, November 30, 1805.”\nThe dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They began as\nfollows:\n“As the enemy’s left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends\nalong Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there, while we, on\nthe other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his right, it is\nadvantageous to attack the enemy’s latter wing especially if we occupy the\nvillages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we can both fall on his flank\nand pursue him over the plain between Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa\nforest, avoiding the defiles of Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the\nenemy’s front. For this object it is necessary that... The first column\nmarches... The second column marches... The third column marches...” and\nso on, read Weyrother."}, {"page": 363, "text": "The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions. The\ntall, fair-haired General Buxhöwden stood, leaning his back against the\nwall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen or even to\nwish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite Weyrother, with his glistening\nwide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards, sat the\nruddy Milorádovich in a military pose, his elbows turned outwards, his\nhands on his knees, and his shoulders raised. He remained stubbornly silent,\ngazing at Weyrother’s face, and only turned away his eyes when the\nAustrian chief of staff finished reading. Then Milorádovich looked round\nsignificantly at the other generals. But one could not tell from that\nsignificant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not\nwith the arrangements. Next to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a\nsubtle smile that never left his typically southern French face during the\nwhole time of the reading, gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly\ntwirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In the middle\nof one of the longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the\nsnuffbox, raised his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the\ncorners of his thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something.\nBut the Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his\nelbows, as if to say: “You can tell me your views later, but now be so good\nas to look at the map and listen.” Langeron lifted his eyes with an\nexpression of perplexity, turned round to Milorádovich as if seeking an\nexplanation, but meeting the latter’s impressive but meaningless gaze\ndrooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.\n“A geography lesson!” he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough to\nbe heard.\nPrzebyszéwski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his hand to\nhis ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in attention.\nDohktúrov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with an assiduous and\nmodest mien, and stooping over the outspread map conscientiously studied\nthe dispositions and the unfamiliar locality. He asked Weyrother several\ntimes to repeat words he had not clearly heard and the difficult names of\nvillages. Weyrother complied and Dohktúrov noted them down.\nWhen the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron\nagain brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at\nanyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out such a"}, {"page": 364, "text": "plan in which the enemy’s position was assumed to be known, whereas it\nwas perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement. Langeron’s\nobjections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim was to show\nGeneral Weyrother—who had read his dispositions with as much self-\nconfidence as if he were addressing school children—that he had to do, not\nwith fools, but with men who could teach him something in military\nmatters.\nWhen the monotonous sound of Weyrother’s voice ceased, Kutúzov\nopened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill\nwheel is interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking,\n“So you are still at that silly business!” quickly closed his eye again, and let\nhis head sink still lower.\nLangeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrother’s vanity as\nauthor of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily attack\ninstead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this plan perfectly\nworthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous\nsmile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections be they what\nthey might.\n“If he could attack us, he would have done so today,” said he.\n“So you think he is powerless?” said Langeron.\n“He has forty thousand men at most,” replied Weyrother, with the smile\nof a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case.\n“In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack,” said\nLangeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round for support to\nMilorádovich who was near him.\nBut Milorádovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything\nrather than of what the generals were disputing about.\n“Ma foi!” said he, “tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield.”\nWeyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was\nstrange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to have\nto prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but had also\nconvinced the sovereign Emperors of.\n“The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from\nhis camp,” said he. “What does that mean? Either he is retreating, which is\nthe only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position.” (He smiled"}, {"page": 365, "text": "ironically.) “But even if he also took up a position in the Thuerassa, he\nmerely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our arrangements to the\nminutest detail remain the same.”\n“How is that?...” began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting an\nopportunity to express his doubts.\nKutúzov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the\ngenerals.\n“Gentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow—or rather for today, for it is\npast midnight—cannot now be altered,” said he. “You have heard them, and\nwe shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there is nothing more\nimportant...” he paused, “than to have a good sleep.”\nHe moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was past\nmidnight. Prince Andrew went out.\nThe council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to express\nhis opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy impression.\nWhether Dolgorúkov and Weyrother, or Kutúzov, Langeron, and the others\nwho did not approve of the plan of attack, were right—he did not know.\n“But was it really not possible for Kutúzov to state his views plainly to the\nEmperor? Is it possible that on account of court and personal considerations\ntens of thousands of lives, and my life, my life,” he thought, “must be\nrisked?”\n“Yes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow,” he thought. And\nsuddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most distant, most\nintimate, memories rose in his imagination: he remembered his last parting\nfrom his father and his wife; he remembered the days when he first loved\nher. He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself, and\nin a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which\nhe was billeted with Nesvítski and began to walk up and down before it.\nThe night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed\nmysteriously. “Yes, tomorrow, tomorrow!” he thought. “Tomorrow\neverything may be over for me! All these memories will be no more, none\nof them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly, I\nhave a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all I can do.”\nAnd his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the concentration of fighting at\none point, and the hesitation of all the commanders. And then that happy\nmoment, that Toulon for which he had so long waited, presents itself to him"}, {"page": 366, "text": "at last. He firmly and clearly expresses his opinion to Kutúzov, to\nWeyrother, and to the Emperors. All are struck by the justness of his views,\nbut no one undertakes to carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a division\n—stipulates that no one is to interfere with his arrangements—leads his\ndivision to the decisive point, and gains the victory alone. “But death and\nsuffering?” suggested another voice. Prince Andrew, however, did not\nanswer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs. The dispositions\nfor the next battle are planned by him alone. Nominally he is only an\nadjutant on Kutúzov’s staff, but he does everything alone. The next battle is\nwon by him alone. Kutúzov is removed and he is appointed... “Well and\nthen?” asked the other voice. “If before that you are not ten times wounded,\nkilled, or betrayed, well... what then?...” “Well then,” Prince Andrew\nanswered himself, “I don’t know what will happen and don’t want to know,\nand can’t, but if I want this—want glory, want to be known to men, want to\nbe loved by them, it is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that\nand live only for that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone, but, oh\nGod! what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men’s esteem? Death,\nwounds, the loss of family—I fear nothing. And precious and dear as many\npersons are to me—father, sister, wife—those dearest to me—yet dreadful\nand unnatural as it seems, I would give them all at once for a moment of\nglory, of triumph over men, of love from men I don’t know and never shall\nknow, for the love of these men here,” he thought, as he listened to voices\nin Kutúzov’s courtyard. The voices were those of the orderlies who were\npacking up; one voice, probably a coachman’s, was teasing Kutúzov’s old\ncook whom Prince Andrew knew, and who was called Tit. He was saying,\n“Tit, I say, Tit!”\n“Well?” returned the old man.\n“Go, Tit, thresh a bit!” said the wag.\n“Oh, go to the devil!” called out a voice, drowned by the laughter of the\norderlies and servants.\n“All the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I value\nthis mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this mist!”"}, {"page": 367, "text": "CHAPTER XIII\nThat same night, Rostóv was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front\nof Bagratión’s detachment. His hussars were placed along the line in\ncouples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness\nthat kept coming over him. An enormous space, with our army’s campfires\ndimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him; in front of him was\nmisty darkness. Rostóv could see nothing, peer as he would into that foggy\ndistance: now something gleamed gray, now there was something black,\nnow little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be, now he\nfancied it was only something in his own eyes. His eyes kept closing, and in\nhis fancy appeared—now the Emperor, now Denísov, and now Moscow\nmemories—and he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before\nhim the head and ears of the horse he was riding, and sometimes, when he\ncame within six paces of them, the black figures of hussars, but in the\ndistance was still the same misty darkness. “Why not?... It might easily\nhappen,” thought Rostóv, “that the Emperor will meet me and give me an\norder as he would to any other officer; he’ll say: ‘Go and find out what’s\nthere.’ There are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a\nchance way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave me a place near\nhim? Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I\nwould unmask his deceivers!” And in order to realize vividly his love\ndevotion to the sovereign, Rostóv pictured to himself an enemy or a\ndeceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom he\nwould slap in the face before the Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout aroused\nhim. He started and opened his eyes.\n“Where am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and watchword—\nshaft, Olmütz. What a nuisance that our squadron will be in reserve\ntomorrow,” he thought. “I’ll ask leave to go to the front, this may be my\nonly chance of seeing the Emperor. It won’t be long now before I am off\nduty. I’ll take another turn and when I get back I’ll go to the general and ask"}, {"page": 368, "text": "him.” He readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse to ride\nonce more round his hussars. It seemed to him that it was getting lighter. To\nthe left he saw a sloping descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that\nseemed as steep as a wall. On this knoll there was a white patch that Rostóv\ncould not at all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or\nsome unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought something\nmoved on that white spot. “I expect it’s snow... that spot... a spot—une\ntache,” he thought. “There now... it’s not a tache... Natásha... sister, black\neyes... Na... tasha... (Won’t she be surprised when I tell her how I’ve seen\nthe Emperor?) Natásha... take my sabretache...”—“Keep to the right, your\nhonor, there are bushes here,” came the voice of an hussar, past whom\nRostóv was riding in the act of falling asleep. Rostóv lifted his head that\nhad sunk almost to his horse’s mane and pulled up beside the hussar. He\nwas succumbing to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness. “But what\nwas I thinking? I mustn’t forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor? No,\nthat’s not it—that’s tomorrow. Oh yes! Natásha... sabretache... saber them...\nWhom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches. Along the Tverskáya\nStreet rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought about him too, just\nopposite Gúryev’s house... Old Gúryev.... Oh, but Denísov’s a fine fellow.\nBut that’s all nonsense. The chief thing is that the Emperor is here. How he\nlooked at me and wished to say something, but dared not.... No, it was I\nwho dared not. But that’s nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the\nimportant thing I was thinking of. Yes, Na-tásha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes!\nThat’s right!” And his head once more sank to his horse’s neck. All at once\nit seemed to him that he was being fired at. “What? What? What?... Cut\nthem down! What?...” said Rostóv, waking up. At the moment he opened\nhis eyes he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long-drawn\nshouts of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of the hussar near\nhim pricked their ears at these shouts. Over there, where the shouting came\nfrom, a fire flared up and went out again, then another, and all along the\nFrench line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder and\nlouder. Rostóv could hear the sound of French words but could not\ndistinguish them. The din of many voices was too great; all he could hear\nwas: “ahahah!” and “rrrr!”\n“What’s that? What do you make of it?” said Rostóv to the hussar beside\nhim. “That must be the enemy’s camp!”\nThe hussar did not reply."}, {"page": 369, "text": "“Why, don’t you hear it?” Rostóv asked again, after waiting for a reply.\n“Who can tell, your honor?” replied the hussar reluctantly.\n“From the direction, it must be the enemy,” repeated Rostóv.\n“It may be he or it may be nothing,” muttered the hussar. “It’s dark...\nSteady!” he cried to his fidgeting horse.\nRostóv’s horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground,\npricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting grew\nstill louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of several\nthousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and farther, probably\nalong the line of the French camp. Rostóv no longer wanted to sleep. The\ngay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him.\n“Vive l’Empereur! l’Empereur!” he now heard distinctly.\n“They can’t be far off, probably just beyond the stream,” he said to the\nhussar beside him.\nThe hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. The sound\nof horse’s hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard,\nand out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly\nappeared, looming huge as an elephant.\n“Your honor, the generals!” said the sergeant, riding up to Rostóv.\nRostóv, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with the\nsergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line. One\nwas on a white horse. Prince Bagratión and Prince Dolgorúkov with their\nadjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights and\nshouts in the enemy’s camp. Rostóv rode up to Bagratión, reported to him,\nand then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying.\n“Believe me,” said Prince Dolgorúkov, addressing Bagratión, “it is\nnothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle\nfires and make a noise to deceive us.”\n“Hardly,” said Bagratión. “I saw them this evening on that knoll; if they\nhad retreated they would have withdrawn from that too.... Officer!” said\nBagratión to Rostóv, “are the enemy’s skirmishers still there?”\n“They were there this evening, but now I don’t know, your excellency.\nShall I go with some of my hussars to see?” replied Rostóv."}, {"page": 370, "text": "Bagratión stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rostóv’s face in the\nmist.\n“Well, go and see,” he said, after a pause.\n“Yes, sir.”\nRostóv spurred his horse, called to Sergeant Fédchenko and two other\nhussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction from\nwhich the shouting came. He felt both frightened and pleased to be riding\nalone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance\nwhere no one had been before him. Bagratión called to him from the hill not\nto go beyond the stream, but Rostóv pretended not to hear him and did not\nstop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies\nfor men and continually discovering his mistakes. Having descended the\nhill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or the enemy’s fires, but heard\nthe shouting of the French more loudly and distinctly. In the valley he saw\nbefore him something like a river, but when he reached it he found it was a\nroad. Having come out onto the road he reined in his horse, hesitating\nwhether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the\nhillside. To keep to the road which gleamed white in the mist would have\nbeen safer because it would be easier to see people coming along it.\n“Follow me!” said he, crossed the road, and began riding up the hill at a\ngallop toward the point where the French pickets had been standing that\nevening.\n“Your honor, there he is!” cried one of the hussars behind him. And\nbefore Rostóv had time to make out what the black thing was that had\nsuddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report, and a\nbullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed out of\nhearing. Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan. Rostóv turned\nhis horse and galloped back. Four more reports followed at intervals, and\nthe bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different tones. Rostóv\nreined in his horse, whose spirits had risen, like his own, at the firing, and\nwent back at a footpace. “Well, some more! Some more!” a merry voice\nwas saying in his soul. But no more shots came.\nOnly when approaching Bagratión did Rostóv let his horse gallop again,\nand with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.\nDolgorúkov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had only\nlit fires to deceive us."}, {"page": 371, "text": "“What does that prove?” he was saying as Rostóv rode up. “They might\nretreat and leave the pickets.”\n“It’s plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince,” said Bagratión. “Wait\ntill tomorrow morning, we’ll find out everything tomorrow.”\n“The picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was in the\nevening,” reported Rostóv, stooping forward with his hand at the salute and\nunable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride and especially by\nthe sound of the bullets.\n“Very good, very good,” said Bagratión. “Thank you, officer.”\n“Your excellency,” said Rostóv, “may I ask a favor?”\n“What is it?”\n“Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attached to\nthe first squadron?”\n“What’s your name?”\n“Count Rostóv.”\n“Oh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.”\n“Count Ilyá Rostóv’s son?” asked Dolgorúkov.\nBut Rostóv did not reply.\n“Then I may reckon on it, your excellency?”\n“I will give the order.”\n“Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the\nEmperor,” thought Rostóv.\n“Thank God!”\nThe fires and shouting in the enemy’s army were occasioned by the fact\nthat while Napoleon’s proclamation was being read to the troops the\nEmperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing him, lit\nwisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, “Vive l’Empereur!” Napoleon’s\nproclamation was as follows:\nSoldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the\nAustrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at\nHollabrünn and have pursued ever since to this place.

The troops of the center, the\nreserves, and Bagratión’s right flank had not yet moved, but on the left\nflank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, which were to be the\nfirst to descend the heights to attack the French right flank and drive it into\nthe Bohemian mountains according to plan, were already up and astir. The\nsmoke of the campfires, into which they were throwing everything\nsuperfluous, made the eyes smart. It was cold and dark. The officers were\nhurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the soldiers, munching biscuit and\nbeating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves, gathering round the\nfires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels,\ntubs, and everything that they did not want or could not carry away with\nthem. Austrian column guides were moving in and out among the Russian\ntroops and served as heralds of the advance. As soon as an Austrian officer\nshowed himself near a commanding officer’s quarters, the regiment began\nto move: the soldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into their boots,\ntheir bags into the carts, got their muskets ready, and formed rank. The\nofficers buttoned up their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches, and\nmoved along the ranks shouting. The train drivers and orderlies harnessed\nand packed the wagons and tied on the loads. The adjutants and battalion\nand regimental commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave final\ninstructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men who remained\nbehind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded. The\ncolumn moved forward without knowing where and unable, from the\nmasses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see either the\nplace they were leaving or that to which they were going.\nA soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as\nmuch as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has walked, whatever\nstrange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is\nalways surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so the"}, {"page": 374, "text": "soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks, the same\nsergeant major Iván Mítrich, the same company dog Jack, and the same\ncommanders. The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship\nis sailing, but on the day of battle—heaven knows how and whence—a\nstern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an\narmy, announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn, and\nawakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of battle the soldiers\nexcitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment, they listen\nintently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning what is going on around\nthem.\nThe fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could\nnot see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level ground\nlike cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one might encounter an\nenemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns advanced for a long time,\nalways in the same fog, descending and ascending hills, avoiding gardens\nand enclosures, going over new and unknown ground, and nowhere\nencountering the enemy. On the contrary, the soldiers became aware that in\nfront, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns were moving in the\nsame direction. Every soldier felt glad to know that to the unknown place\nwhere he was going, many more of our men were going too.\n“There now, the Kúrskies have also gone past,” was being said in the\nranks.\n“It’s wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last night I\nlooked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A regular Moscow!”\nThough none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to\nthe men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of\nhumor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themselves to\ncheer the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops marched\ngaily, as they always do when going into action, especially to an attack. But\nwhen they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog, the greater part\nof the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation\nand blunder spread through the ranks. How such a consciousness is\ncommunicated is very difficult to define, but it certainly is communicated\nvery surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly, and irrepressibly, as water\ndoes in a creek. Had the Russian army been alone without any allies, it\nmight perhaps have been a long time before this consciousness of"}, {"page": 375, "text": "mismanagement became a general conviction, but as it was, the disorder\nwas readily and naturally attributed to the stupid Germans, and everyone\nwas convinced that a dangerous muddle had been occasioned by the\nsausage eaters.\n“Why have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come\nup against the French?”\n“No, one can’t hear them. They’d be firing if we had.”\n“They were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in the\nmiddle of a field without rhyme or reason. It’s all those damned Germans’\nmuddling! What stupid devils!”\n“Yes, I’d send them on in front, but no fear, they’re crowding up behind.\nAnd now here we stand hungry.”\n“I say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking the\nway,” said an officer.\n“Ah, those damned Germans! They don’t know their own country!” said\nanother.\n“What division are you?” shouted an adjutant, riding up.\n“The Eighteenth.”\n“Then why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you\nwon’t get there till evening.”\n“What stupid orders! They don’t themselves know what they are doing!”\nsaid the officer and rode off.\nThen a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.\n“Tafa-lafa! But what he’s jabbering no one can make out,” said a soldier,\nmimicking the general who had ridden away. “I’d shoot them, the\nscoundrels!”\n“We were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we haven’t got\nhalfway. Fine orders!” was being repeated on different sides.\nAnd the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to turn\ninto vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the Germans.\nThe cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was\nmoving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center\nwas too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered"}, {"page": 376, "text": "to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in front of the\ninfantry, who had to wait.\nAt the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a\nRussian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be\nhalted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to\nblame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited. After an\nhour’s delay they at last moved on, descending the hill. The fog that was\ndispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they were\ndescending. In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another, at first\nirregularly at varying intervals—trata...tat—and then more and more\nregularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream began.\nNot expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having\nstumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their\ncommanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through\nthe ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front or around\nthem in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily\nand advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders from the officers\nor adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings\nunable to find their own regiments. In this way the action began for the\nfirst, second, and third columns, which had gone down into the valley. The\nfourth column, with which Kutúzov was, stood on the Pratzen Heights.\nBelow, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog; on the\nhigher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was going\non in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed, six miles\naway, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one knew till\nafter eight o’clock.\nIt was nine o’clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea down\nbelow, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood\nwith his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was a clear\nblue sky, and the sun’s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, crimson float\non the surface of that milky sea of mist. The whole French army, and even\nNapoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side of the streams and\nhollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take\nup our position and begin the action, but were on this side, so close to our\nown forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted\nman from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he had worn on"}, {"page": 377, "text": "his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in front of his\nmarshals. He gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea\nof mist and on which the Russian troops were moving in the distance, and\nhe listened to the sounds of firing in the valley. Not a single muscle of his\nface—which in those days was still thin—moved. His gleaming eyes were\nfixed intently on one spot. His predictions were being justified. Part of the\nRussian force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and\nlakes and part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to\nattack and regarded as the key to the position. He saw over the mist that in a\nhollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian columns,\ntheir bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one direction toward\nthe valley and disappearing one after another into the mist. From\ninformation he had received the evening before, from the sound of wheels\nand footsteps heard by the outposts during the night, by the disorderly\nmovement of the Russian columns, and from all indications, he saw clearly\nthat the allies believed him to be far away in front of them, and that the\ncolumns moving near Pratzen constituted the center of the Russian army,\nand that that center was already sufficiently weakened to be successfully\nattacked. But still he did not begin the engagement.\nToday was a great day for him—the anniversary of his coronation. Before\ndawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and in good\nspirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood\nin which everything seems possible and everything succeeds. He sat\nmotionless, looking at the heights visible above the mist, and his cold face\nwore that special look of confident, self-complacent happiness that one sees\non the face of a boy happily in love. The marshals stood behind him not\nventuring to distract his attention. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights,\nnow at the sun floating up out of the mist.\nWhen the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist\nwere aglow with dazzling light—as if he had only awaited this to begin the\naction—he drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign with it\nto the marshals, and ordered the action to begin. The marshals,\naccompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions, and a few\nminutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly toward\nthose Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by\nRussian troops moving down the valley to their left."}, {"page": 378, "text": "CHAPTER XV\nAt eight o’clock Kutúzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth\ncolumn, Milorádovich’s, the one that was to take the place of\nPrzebyszéwski’s and Langeron’s columns which had already gone down\ninto the valley. He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them\nthe order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead that column\nhimself. When he had reached the village of Pratzen he halted. Prince\nAndrew was behind, among the immense number forming the commander\nin chief’s suite. He was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation,\nthough controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of a long-awaited\nmoment. He was firmly convinced that this was the day of his Toulon, or\nhis bridge of Arcola. How it would come about he did not know, but he felt\nsure it would do so. The locality and the position of our troops were known\nto him as far as they could be known to anyone in our army. His own\nstrategic plan, which obviously could not now be carried out, was forgotten.\nNow, entering into Weyrother’s plan, Prince Andrew considered possible\ncontingencies and formed new projects such as might call for his rapidity of\nperception and decision.\nTo the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces\ncould be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would\nconcentrate. “There we shall encounter difficulties, and there,” thought he,\n“I shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there, standard in hand, I\nshall go forward and break whatever is in front of me.”\nHe could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions.\nSeeing them he kept thinking, “That may be the very standard with which I\nshall lead the army.”\nIn the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a\nhoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a milk-white\nsea. Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which our troops had\ndescended and from whence came the sounds of firing. Above the heights"}, {"page": 379, "text": "was the dark clear sky, and to the right the vast orb of the sun. In front, far\noff on the farther shore of that sea of mist, some wooded hills were\ndiscernible, and it was there the enemy probably was, for something could\nbe descried. On the right the Guards were entering the misty region with a\nsound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets; to the\nleft beyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared\nin the sea of mist. In front and behind moved infantry. The commander in\nchief was standing at the end of the village letting the troops pass by him.\nThat morning Kutúzov seemed worn and irritable. The infantry passing\nbefore him came to a halt without any command being given, apparently\nobstructed by something in front.\n“Do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village!”\nhe said angrily to a general who had ridden up. “Don’t you understand, your\nexcellency, my dear sir, that you must not defile through narrow village\nstreets when we are marching against the enemy?”\n“I intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,”\nanswered the general.\nKutúzov laughed bitterly.\n“You’ll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy! Very\nfine!”\n“The enemy is still far away, your excellency. According to the\ndispositions...”\n“The dispositions!” exclaimed Kutúzov bitterly. “Who told you that?...\nKindly do as you are ordered.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“My dear fellow,” Nesvítski whispered to Prince Andrew, “the old man is\nas surly as a dog.”\nAn Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat\ngalloped up to Kutúzov and asked in the Emperor’s name had the fourth\ncolumn advanced into action.\nKutúzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall\nupon Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kutúzov’s\nmalevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what was\nbeing done was not his adjutant’s fault, and still not answering the Austrian\nadjutant, he addressed Bolkónski."}, {"page": 380, "text": "“Go, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed the\nvillage. Tell it to stop and await my orders.”\nHardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.\n“And ask whether sharpshooters have been posted,” he added. “What are\nthey doing? What are they doing?” he murmured to himself, still not\nreplying to the Austrian.\nPrince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.\nOvertaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped the third\ndivision and convinced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in\nfront of our columns. The colonel at the head of the regiment was much\nsurprised at the commander in chief’s order to throw out skirmishers. He\nhad felt perfectly sure that there were other troops in front of him and that\nthe enemy must be at least six miles away. There was really nothing to be\nseen in front except a barren descent hidden by dense mist. Having given\norders in the commander in chief’s name to rectify this omission, Prince\nAndrew galloped back. Kutúzov still in the same place, his stout body\nresting heavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily\nwith closed eyes. The troops were no longer moving, but stood with the\nbutts of their muskets on the ground.\n“All right, all right!” he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a general\nwho, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all the left-flank\ncolumns had already descended.\n“Plenty of time, your excellency,” muttered Kutúzov in the midst of a\nyawn. “Plenty of time,” he repeated.\nJust then at a distance behind Kutúzov was heard the sound of regiments\nsaluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended line\nof the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person they were greeting\nwas riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front of which\nKutúzov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one side and looked\nround with a frown. Along the road from Pratzen galloped what looked like\na squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them rode side by side\nin front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat\nrode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who was in a white uniform rode\na black one. These were the two Emperors followed by their suites.\nKutúzov, affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front, gave the\ncommand “Attention!” and rode up to the Emperors with a salute. His"}, {"page": 381, "text": "whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed. He put on the air\nof a subordinate who obeys without reasoning. With an affectation of\nrespect which evidently struck Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and\nsaluted.\nThis unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face\nof the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished. After\nhis illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of Olmütz\nwhere Bolkónski had seen him for the first time abroad, but there was still\nthe same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray\neyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression and\nthe same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth.\nAt the Olmütz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed\nbrighter and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping two\nmiles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the\nfaces of his suite, young and animated as his own. Czartorýski, Novosíltsev,\nPrince Volkónsky, Strógonov, and the others, all richly dressed gay young\nmen on splendid, well-groomed, fresh, only slightly heated horses,\nexchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the Emperor. The\nEmperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very erect on his\nhandsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied\nmanner. He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some question\n—“Most likely he is asking at what o’clock they started,” thought Prince\nAndrew, watching his old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as\nhe recalled his reception at Brünn. In the Emperors’ suite were the picked\nyoung orderly officers of the Guard and line regiments, Russian and\nAustrian. Among them were grooms leading the Tsar’s beautiful relay\nhorses covered with embroidered cloths.\nAs when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a\nstuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence of success\nreached Kutúzov’s cheerless staff with the galloping advent of all these\nbrilliant young men.\n“Why aren’t you beginning, Michael Ilariónovich?” said the Emperor\nAlexander hurriedly to Kutúzov, glancing courteously at the same time at\nthe Emperor Francis.\n“I am waiting, Your Majesty,” answered Kutúzov, bending forward\nrespectfully."}, {"page": 382, "text": "The Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had not\nquite heard.\n“Waiting, Your Majesty,” repeated Kutúzov. (Prince Andrew noted that\nKutúzov’s upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word “waiting.”)\n“Not all the columns have formed up yet, Your Majesty.”\nThe Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his\nrather round shoulders and glanced at Novosíltsev who was near him, as if\ncomplaining of Kutúzov.\n“You know, Michael Ilariónovich, we are not on the Empress’ Field\nwhere a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled,” said the\nTsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting him if not to\njoin in at least to listen to what he was saying. But the Emperor Francis\ncontinued to look about him and did not listen.\n“That is just why I do not begin, sire,” said Kutúzov in a resounding\nvoice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard, and again\nsomething in his face twitched—“That is just why I do not begin, sire,\nbecause we are not on parade and not on the Empress’ Field,” said he\nclearly and distinctly.\nIn the Emperor’s suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed\ndissatisfaction and reproach. “Old though he may be, he should not, he\ncertainly should not, speak like that,” their glances seemed to say.\nThe Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kutúzov’s eye waiting to\nhear whether he would say anything more. But Kutúzov, with respectfully\nbowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence lasted for about a\nminute.\n“However, if you command it, Your Majesty,” said Kutúzov, lifting his\nhead and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning, but\nsubmissive general.\nHe touched his horse and having called Milorádovich, the commander of\nthe column, gave him the order to advance.\nThe troops again began to move, and two battalions of the Nóvgorod and\none of the Ápsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.\nAs this Ápsheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Milorádovich,\nwithout his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous tuft of\nplumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front and back,"}, {"page": 383, "text": "galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined in his horse\nbefore the Emperor.\n“God be with you, general!” said the Emperor.\n“Ma foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilité, sire,” * he\nanswered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the gentlemen of\nthe Tsar’s suite by his poor French.\n* “Indeed, Sire, we shall do everything it is possible to do, Sire.”\nMilorádovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little\nbehind the Emperor. The Ápsheron men, excited by the Tsar’s presence,\npassed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk pace.\n“Lads!” shouted Milorádovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery\nvoice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of battle,\nand by the sight of the gallant Ápsherons, his comrades in Suvórov’s time,\nnow passing so gallantly before the Emperors, that he forgot the sovereigns’\npresence. “Lads, it’s not the first village you’ve had to take,” cried he.\n“Glad to do our best!” shouted the soldiers.\nThe Emperor’s horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had carried\nthe sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the field of\nAusterlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its ears\nat the sound of shots just as it had done on the Empress’ Field, not\nunderstanding the significance of the firing, nor of the nearness of the\nEmperor Francis’ black cob, nor of all that was being said, thought, and felt\nthat day by its rider.\nThe Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a\nremark to him, pointing to the gallant Ápsherons."}, {"page": 384, "text": "CHAPTER XVI\nKutúzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the\ncarabineers.\nWhen he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he\nstopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been an inn,\nwhere two roads parted. Both of them led downhill and troops were\nmarching along both.\nThe fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible\nabout a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down below, on the left,\nthe firing became more distinct. Kutúzov had stopped and was speaking to\nan Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who was a little behind looking at\nthem, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.\n“Look, look!” said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the distance,\nbut down the hill before him. “It’s the French!”\nThe two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying to\nsnatch it from one another. The expression on all their faces suddenly\nchanged to one of horror. The French were supposed to be a mile and a half\naway, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us.\n“It’s the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But how is that?”\nsaid different voices.\nWith the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not more\nthan five hundred paces from where Kutúzov was standing, a dense French\ncolumn coming up to meet the Ápsherons.\n“Here it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn has come,”\nthought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kutúzov.\n“The Ápsherons must be stopped, your excellency,” cried he. But at that\nvery instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard quite close\nat hand, and a voice of naïve terror barely two steps from Prince Andrew"}, {"page": 385, "text": "shouted, “Brothers! All’s lost!” And at this as if at a command, everyone\nbegan to run.\nConfused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five\nminutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would it have\nbeen difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible not to be carried\nback with it oneself. Bolkónski only tried not to lose touch with it, and\nlooked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was happening in front\nof him. Nesvítski with an angry face, red and unlike himself, was shouting\nto Kutúzov that if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken\nprisoner. Kutúzov remained in the same place and without answering drew\nout a handkerchief. Blood was flowing from his cheek. Prince Andrew\nforced his way to him.\n“You are wounded?” he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of his\nlower jaw.\n“The wound is not here, it is there!” said Kutúzov, pressing the\nhandkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers.\n“Stop them!” he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing that it\nwas impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.\nA fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.\nThe troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by\nthem it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, “Get on! Why are\nyou hindering us?” Another in the same place turned round and fired in the\nair; a third was striking the horse Kutúzov himself rode. Having by a great\neffort got away to the left from that flood of men, Kutúzov, with his suite\ndiminished by more than half, rode toward a sound of artillery fire near by.\nHaving forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives, Prince Andrew, trying\nto keep near Kutúzov, saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian\nbattery that was still firing and Frenchmen running toward it. Higher up\nstood some Russian infantry, neither moving forward to protect the battery\nnor backward with the fleeing crowd. A mounted general separated himself\nfrom the infantry and approached Kutúzov. Of Kutúzov’s suite only four\nremained. They were all pale and exchanged looks in silence.\n“Stop those wretches!” gasped Kutúzov to the regimental commander,\npointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to punish him for\nthose words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across Kutúzov’s\nsuite like a flock of little birds."}, {"page": 386, "text": "The French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutúzov, were firing at\nhim. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg; several\nsoldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag let it fall\nfrom his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the muskets of the nearest\nsoldiers. The soldiers started firing without orders.\n“Oh! Oh! Oh!” groaned Kutúzov despairingly and looked around....\n“Bolkónski!” he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness of the\nfeebleness of age, “Bolkónski!” he whispered, pointing to the disordered\nbattalion and at the enemy, “what’s that?”\nBut before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of\nshame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to\nthe standard.\n“Forward, lads!” he shouted in a voice piercing as a child’s.\n“Here it is!” thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with\npleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him. Several soldiers fell.\n“Hurrah!” shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the\nheavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion\nwould follow him.\nAnd really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then\nanother and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting “Hurrah!” and\novertook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was\nswaying from its weight in Prince Andrew’s hands, but he was immediately\nkilled. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and, dragging it by the\nstaff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw our artillerymen, some of\nwhom were fighting, while others, having abandoned their guns, were\nrunning toward him. He also saw French infantry soldiers who were seizing\nthe artillery horses and turning the guns round. Prince Andrew and the\nbattalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon. He heard the\nwhistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and left of him\nsoldiers continually groaned and dropped. But he did not look at them: he\nlooked only at what was going on in front of him—at the battery. He now\nsaw clearly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry,\npulling one end of a mop while a French soldier tugged at the other. He\ncould distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these\ntwo men, who evidently did not realize what they were doing."}, {"page": 387, "text": "“What are they about?” thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them.\n“Why doesn’t the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed? Why\ndoesn’t the Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the\nFrenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him....”\nAnd really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to the\nstruggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had triumphantly\nsecured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him, was about to be\ndecided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended. It seemed to him as\nthough one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing\nof a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but the worst of it was that the pain distracted\nhim and prevented his seeing what he had been looking at.\n“What’s this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way,” thought he, and fell\non his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle of the\nFrenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner had been\nkilled or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved. But he\nsaw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the sky—the lofty sky,\nnot clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds gliding slowly\nacross it. “How quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not at all as I ran,” thought\nPrince Andrew—“not as we ran, shouting and fighting, not at all as the\ngunner and the Frenchman with frightened and angry faces struggled for the\nmop: how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky!\nHow was it I did not see that lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have\nfound it at last! Yes! All is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky.\nThere is nothing, nothing, but that.

Not wishing to agree to Dolgorúkov’s demand to\ncommence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself,\nPrince Bagratión proposed to Dolgorúkov to send to inquire of the\ncommander in chief. Bagratión knew that as the distance between the two\nflanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were not killed\n(which he very likely would be), and found the commander in chief (which\nwould be very difficult), he would not be able to get back before evening.\nBagratión cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite, and\nthe boyish face of Rostóv, breathless with excitement and hope, was the\nfirst to catch his eye. He sent him.\n“And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in chief,\nyour excellency?” said Rostóv, with his hand to his cap.\n“You can give the message to His Majesty,” said Dolgorúkov, hurriedly\ninterrupting Bagratión.\nOn being relieved from picket duty Rostóv had managed to get a few\nhours’ sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute, with\nelasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in that state\nof mind which makes everything seem possible, pleasant, and easy.\nAll his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be a\ngeneral engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he was\norderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going with a message\nto Kutúzov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself. The morning was bright,\nhe had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of joy and happiness.\nOn receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the\nline. At first he rode along the line of Bagratión’s troops, which had not yet\nadvanced into action but were standing motionless; then he came to the\nregion occupied by Uvárov’s cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of"}, {"page": 389, "text": "preparation for battle; having passed Uvárov’s cavalry he clearly heard the\nsound of cannon and musketry ahead of him. The firing grew louder and\nlouder.\nIn the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket shots at\nirregular intervals as before, followed by one or two cannon shots, but a roll\nof volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before Pratzen, interrupted\nby such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not\nseparated from one another but merged into a general roar.\nHe could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another\ndown the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading, and\nmingling with one another. He could also, by the gleam of bayonets visible\nthrough the smoke, make out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of\nartillery with green caissons.\nRostóv stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was\ngoing on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or\nmake out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men of some\nsort were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of troops; but why,\nwhither, and who they were, it was impossible to make out. These sights\nand sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him; on the contrary,\nthey stimulated his energy and determination.\n“Go on! Go on! Give it them!” he mentally exclaimed at these sounds,\nand again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and farther\ninto the region where the army was already in action.\n“How it will be there I don’t know, but all will be well!” thought Rostóv.\nAfter passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the\nline (the Guards) was already in action.\n“So much the better! I shall see it close,” he thought.\nHe was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came\ngalloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered ranks\nwere returning from the attack. Rostóv got out of their way, involuntarily\nnoticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.\n“That is no business of mine,” he thought. He had not ridden many\nhundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole width of\nthe field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms, mounted\non black horses, trotting straight toward him and across his path. Rostóv put"}, {"page": 390, "text": "his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men, and he would\nhave got clear had they continued at the same speed, but they kept\nincreasing their pace, so that some of the horses were already galloping.\nRostóv heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and\nsaw their horses, their figures, and even their faces, more and more\ndistinctly. They were our Horse Guards, advancing to attack the French\ncavalry that was coming to meet them.\nThe Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses.\nRostóv could already see their faces and heard the command: “Charge!”\nshouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed.\nRostóv, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French,\ngalloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but still was not in\ntime to avoid them.\nThe last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily\non seeing Rostóv before him, with whom he would inevitably collide. This\nGuardsman would certainly have bowled Rostóv and his Bedouin over\n(Rostóv felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men\nand horses) had it not occurred to Rostóv to flourish his whip before the\neyes of the Guardsman’s horse. The heavy black horse, sixteen hands high,\nshied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman drove his\nhuge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail and extending its\nneck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rostóv\nbefore he heard them shout, “Hurrah!” and looking back saw that their\nforemost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets,\nprobably French. He could see nothing more, for immediately afterwards\ncannon began firing from somewhere and smoke enveloped everything.\nAt that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared in\nthe smoke, Rostóv hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where he\nwas sent. This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that amazed the\nFrench themselves. Rostóv was horrified to hear later that of all that mass\nof huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant, rich youths, officers and\ncadets, who had galloped past him on their thousand-ruble horses, only\neighteen were left after the charge.\n“Why should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see\nthe Emperor immediately!” thought Rostóv and galloped on."}, {"page": 391, "text": "When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and\naround them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so much\nbecause he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers’\nfaces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the officers.\nPassing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a\nvoice calling him by name.\n“Rostóv!”\n“What?” he answered, not recognizing Borís.\n“I say, we’ve been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!” said Borís\nwith the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under\nfire for the first time.\nRostóv stopped.\n“Have you?” he said. “Well, how did it go?”\n“We drove them back!” said Borís with animation, growing talkative.\n“Can you imagine it?” and he began describing how the Guards, having\ntaken up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were\nAustrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by\nthose troops that they were themselves in the front line and had\nunexpectedly to go into action. Rostóv without hearing Borís to the end\nspurred his horse.\n“Where are you off to?” asked Borís.\n“With a message to His Majesty.”\n“There he is!” said Borís, thinking Rostóv had said “His Highness,” and\npointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders and frowning\nbrows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and Horse\nGuards’ jacket, shouting something to a pale, white uniformed Austrian\nofficer.\n“But that’s the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the\nEmperor,” said Rostóv, and was about to spur his horse.\n“Count! Count!” shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager as\nBorís. “Count! I am wounded in my right hand” (and he showed his\nbleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) “and I remained at the\nfront. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our family—the von\nBergs—have been knights!”"}, {"page": 392, "text": "He said something more, but Rostóv did not wait to hear it and rode\naway.\nHaving passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rostóv, to avoid\nagain getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse Guards\ncharged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place where the\nhottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. Suddenly he heard musket\nfire quite close in front of him and behind our troops, where he could never\nhave expected the enemy to be.\n“What can it be?” he thought. “The enemy in the rear of our army?\nImpossible!” And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself and\nfor the issue of the whole battle. “But be that what it may,” he reflected,\n“there is no riding round it now. I must look for the commander in chief\nhere, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest.”\nThe foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rostóv was more\nand more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of\nPratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.\n“What does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is\nfiring?” Rostóv kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian soldiers\nrunning in confused crowds across his path.\n“The devil knows! They’ve killed everybody! It’s all up now!” he was\ntold in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who\nunderstood what was happening as little as he did.\n“Kill the Germans!” shouted one.\n“May the devil take them—the traitors!”\n“Zum Henker diese Russen!” * muttered a German.\n* “Hang these Russians!”\nSeveral wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse,\nscreams, and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing died\ndown. Rostóv learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been\nfiring at one another.\n“My God! What does it all mean?” thought he. “And here, where at any\nmoment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only a handful\nof scoundrels. It will soon be over, it can’t be that, it can’t be! Only to get\npast them quicker, quicker!”"}, {"page": 393, "text": "The idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rostóv’s head. Though he\nsaw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where he\nhad been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not, did not\nwish to, believe that."}, {"page": 394, "text": "CHAPTER XVIII\nRostóv had been ordered to look for Kutúzov and the Emperor near the\nvillage of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding officer were\nthere, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He urged on his\nalready weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but the farther he\nwent the more disorganized they were. The highroad on which he had come\nout was thronged with calèches, carriages of all sorts, and Russian and\nAustrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and some not. This whole\nmass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon\nballs flying from the French batteries stationed on the Pratzen Heights.\n“Where is the Emperor? Where is Kutúzov?” Rostóv kept asking\neveryone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone.\nAt last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.\n“Eh, brother! They’ve all bolted long ago!” said the soldier, laughing for\nsome reason and shaking himself free.\nHaving left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rostóv stopped the\nhorse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to\nquestion him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a\ncarriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and that he\nwas dangerously wounded.\n“It can’t be!” said Rostóv. “It must have been someone else.”\n“I saw him myself,” replied the man with a self-confident smile of\nderision. “I ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I’ve seen\nhim in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you.... There he sat in the carriage\nas pale as anything. How they made the four black horses fly! Gracious me,\nthey did rattle past! It’s time I knew the Imperial horses and Ilyá Iványch. I\ndon’t think Ilyá drives anyone except the Tsar!”\nRostóv let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded\nofficer passing by addressed him:"}, {"page": 395, "text": "“Who is it you want?” he asked. “The commander in chief? He was\nkilled by a cannon ball—struck in the breast before our regiment.”\n“Not killed—wounded!” another officer corrected him.\n“Who? Kutúzov?” asked Rostóv.\n“Not Kutúzov, but what’s his name—well, never mind... there are not\nmany left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders are there,”\nsaid the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek, and he walked on.\nRostóv rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now\ngoing. The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible to\ndoubt it now. Rostóv rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which he\nsaw turrets and a church. What need to hurry? What was he now to say to\nthe Tsar or to Kutúzov, even if they were alive and unwounded?\n“Take this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!” a\nsoldier shouted to him. “They’d kill you there!”\n“Oh, what are you talking about?” said another. “Where is he to go? That\nway is nearer.”\nRostóv considered, and then went in the direction where they said he\nwould be killed.\n“It’s all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to save\nmyself?” he thought. He rode on to the region where the greatest number of\nmen had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The French had not yet occupied\nthat region, and the Russians—the uninjured and slightly wounded—had\nleft it long ago. All about the field, like heaps of manure on well-kept\nplowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres.\nThe wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear their\ndistressing screams and groans, sometimes feigned—or so it seemed to\nRostóv. He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men,\nand he felt afraid—afraid not for his life, but for the courage he needed and\nwhich he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates.\nThe French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and\nwounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant riding\nover it trained a gun on him and fired several shots. The sensation of those\nterrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him merged in Rostóv’s\nmind into a single feeling of terror and pity for himself. He remembered his"}, {"page": 396, "text": "mother’s last letter. “What would she feel,” thought he, “if she saw me here\nnow on this field with the cannon aimed at me?”\nIn the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from the\nfield of battle, who though still in some confusion were less disordered. The\nFrench cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire sounded far away.\nHere everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was lost. No one whom\nRostóv asked could tell him where the Emperor or Kutúzov was. Some said\nthe report that the Emperor was wounded was correct, others that it was not,\nand explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that the Emperor’s\ncarriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and\nterrified Ober-Hofmarschal Count Tolstóy, who had ridden out to the\nbattlefield with others in the Emperor’s suite. One officer told Rostóv that\nhe had seen someone from headquarters behind the village to the left, and\nthither Rostóv rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his\nconscience. When he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of\nthe Russian troops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two\nmen on horseback facing the ditch. One with a white plume in his hat\nseemed familiar to Rostóv; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which\nRostóv fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his horse\nwith his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only a little earth\ncrumbled from the bank under the horse’s hind hoofs. Turning the horse\nsharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed the\nhorseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting that he should do the\nsame. The rider, whose figure seemed familiar to Rostóv and involuntarily\nriveted his attention, made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and\nby that gesture Rostóv instantly recognized his lamented and adored\nmonarch.\n“But it can’t be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!” thought\nRostóv. At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rostóv saw the\nbeloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory. The Emperor\nwas pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm, the\nmildness of his features, was all the greater. Rostóv was happy in the\nassurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were false. He\nwas happy to be seeing him. He knew that he might and even ought to go\nstraight to him and give the message Dolgorúkov had ordered him to\ndeliver."}, {"page": 397, "text": "But as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter the\nthoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help or a chance\nof delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is alone with\nher, so Rostóv, now that he had attained what he had longed for more than\nanything else in the world, did not know how to approach the Emperor, and\na thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenient,\nunseemly, and impossible to do so.\n“What! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of his being\nalone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant or painful to\nhim at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to him now, when my\nheart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him?” Not one of\nthe innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that he had composed\nin his imagination could he now recall. Those speeches were intended for\nquite other conditions, they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment\nof victory and triumph, generally when he was dying of wounds and the\nsovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds, and while dying he expressed\nthe love his actions had proved.\n“Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right\nflank now that it is nearly four o’clock and the battle is lost? No, certainly I\nmust not approach him, I must not intrude on his reflections. Better die a\nthousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from\nhim,” Rostóv decided; and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode\naway, continually looking back at the Tsar, who still remained in the same\nattitude of indecision.\nWhile Rostóv was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away,\nCaptain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the Emperor\nat once rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him to cross the\nditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling unwell, sat down\nunder an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him. Rostóv from a\ndistance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke long and warmly\nto the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping, covered his eyes\nwith his hand and pressed von Toll’s hand.\n“And I might have been in his place!” thought Rostóv, and hardly\nrestraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter despair, not\nknowing where to or why he was now riding."}, {"page": 398, "text": "His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was\nthe cause of his grief.\nHe might... not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign.

And he turned round and\ngalloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor, but there was no\none beyond the ditch now. Only some carts and carriages were passing by.\nFrom one of the drivers he learned that Kutúzov’s staff were not far off, in\nthe village the vehicles were going to. Rostóv followed them. In front of\nhim walked Kutúzov’s groom leading horses in horsecloths. Then came a\ncart, and behind that walked an old, bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked\ncap and sheepskin coat.\n“Tit!

Bonaparte riding\nover the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries firing\nat the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left on the\nfield.\n“Fine men!” remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier,\nwho, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his\nstomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.\n“The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your Majesty,”\nsaid an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at\nAugesd.\n“Have some brought from the reserve,” said Napoleon, and having gone\non a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with"}, {"page": 402, "text": "the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him.

He heard the speaker addressed as Sire. But he heard\nthe words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not only did they not\ninterest him, but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them. His\nhead was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death, and he saw above him\nthe remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He knew it was Napoleon—his hero\n—but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small, insignificant\ncreature compared with what was passing now between himself and that\nlofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it. At that moment it meant\nnothing to him who might be standing over him, or what was said of him;\nhe was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that\nthey would help him and bring him back to life, which seemed to him so\nbeautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so differently. He\ncollected all his strength, to stir and utter a sound. He feebly moved his leg\nand uttered a weak, sickly groan which aroused his own pity.\n“Ah! He is alive,” said Napoleon. “Lift this young man up and carry him\nto the dressing station.”\nHaving said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in\nhand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.\nPrince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from\nthe terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while being\nmoved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station. He did not\nregain consciousness till late in the day, when with other wounded and\ncaptured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital. During this transfer\nhe felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak.\nThe first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French\nconvoy officer, who said rapidly: “We must halt here: the Emperor will pass\nhere immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners.”\n“There are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army, that\nhe is probably tired of them,” said another officer.\n“All the same!

Looking into\nNapoleon’s eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness,\nthe unimportance of life which no one could understand, and the still\ngreater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one alive could\nunderstand or explain.\nThe Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one\nof the officers as he went: “Have these gentlemen attended to and taken to\nmy bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds.

Meeting a comrade at the last\npost station but one before Moscow, Denísov had drunk three bottles of\nwine with him and, despite the jolting ruts across the snow-covered road,\ndid not once wake up on the way to Moscow, but lay at the bottom of the\nsleigh beside Rostóv, who grew more and more impatient the nearer they\ngot to Moscow.\n“How much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets,\nshops, bakers’ signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!” thought Rostóv, when\ntheir leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had entered\nMoscow.\n“Denísov! We’re here!

And here’s the\nlittle shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Can’t you hurry up? Now\nthen!”\n“Which house is it?” asked the driver.\n“Why, that one, right at the end, the big one. Don’t you see? That’s our\nhouse,” said Rostóv. “Of course, it’s our house! Denísov, Denísov! We’re\nalmost there!”\nDenísov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer.\n“Dmítri,” said Rostóv to his valet on the box, “those lights are in our\nhouse, aren’t they?”\n“Yes, sir, and there’s a light in your father’s study.”"}, {"page": 409, "text": "“Then they’ve not gone to bed yet?

You shall have three rubles for vodka—get on!” Rostóv shouted, when\nthe sleigh was only three houses from his door. It seemed to him the horses\nwere not moving at all. At last the sleigh bore to the right, drew up at an\nentrance, and Rostóv saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of\nplaster broken off, the porch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He\nsprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house stood\ncold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it. There was no\none in the hall. “Oh God! Is everyone all right?” he thought, stopping for a\nmoment with a sinking heart, and then immediately starting to run along the\nhall and up the warped steps of the familiar staircase.

There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco.\n“Hallo, Gwíska—my pipe!” came Vasíli Denísov’s husky voice.\n“Wostóv, get up!”\nRostóv, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his\ndisheveled head from the hot pillow.\n“Why, is it late?”"}, {"page": 412, "text": "“Late!

We knew\nyou’d say so. But it won’t do, because you see, if you say that—if you\nconsider yourself bound by your promise—it will seem as if she had not\nmeant it seriously. It makes it as if you were marrying her because you\nmust, and that wouldn’t do at all.”\nRostóv saw that it had been well considered by them. Sónya had already\nstruck him by her beauty on the preceding day. Today, when he had caught\na glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She was a charming girl of\nsixteen, evidently passionately in love with him (he did not doubt that for\nan instant). Why should he not love her now, and even marry her, Rostóv\nthought, but just now there were so many other pleasures and interests\nbefore him! “Yes, they have taken a wise decision,” he thought, “I must\nremain free.”\n“Well then, that’s excellent,” said he. “We’ll talk it over later on.

The evening before, in the first happy moment of meeting, they\nhad kissed each other, but today they felt it could not be done; he felt that\neverybody, including his mother and sisters, was looking inquiringly at him\nand watching to see how he would behave with her. He kissed her hand and\naddressed her not as thou but as you—Sónya. But their eyes met and said\nthou, and exchanged tender kisses. Her looks asked him to forgive her for\nhaving dared, by Natásha’s intermediacy, to remind him of his promise, and\nthen thanked him for his love. His looks thanked her for offering him his\nfreedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love\nher, for that would be impossible.\n“How strange it is,” said Véra, selecting a moment when all were silent,\n“that Sónya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet like\nstrangers.”\nVéra’s remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like most of\nher observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not only Sónya,"}, {"page": 416, "text": "Nicholas, and Natásha, but even the old countess, who—dreading this love\naffair which might hinder Nicholas from making a brilliant match—blushed\nlike a girl.\nDenísov, to Rostóv’s surprise, appeared in the drawing room with\npomaded hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as he\nmade himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the ladies\nand gentlemen than Rostóv had ever expected to see him."}, {"page": 417, "text": "CHAPTER II\nOn his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas Rostóv was welcomed\nby his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling Nikólenka;\nby his relations as a charming, attractive, and polite young man; by his\nacquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good dancer, and one\nof the best matches in the city.\nThe Rostóvs knew everybody in Moscow. The old count had money\nenough that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas,\nacquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the latest cut,\nsuch as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the latest fashion, with\nextremely pointed toes and small silver spurs, passed his time very gaily.\nAfter a short period of adapting himself to the old conditions of life,\nNicholas found it very pleasant to be at home again. He felt that he had\ngrown up and matured very much. His despair at failing in a Scripture\nexamination, his borrowing money from Gavríl to pay a sleigh driver, his\nkissing Sónya on the sly—he now recalled all this as childishness he had\nleft immeasurably behind. Now he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a jacket\nlaced with silver, and wearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to soldiers\nfor bravery in action, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and\nrespected racing men was training a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a\nlady on one of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led the\nmazurka at the Arkhárovs’ ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal\nKámenski, visited the English Club, and was on intimate terms with a\ncolonel of forty to whom Denísov had introduced him.\nHis passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. But still,\nas he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him, he often spoke\nabout him and about his love for him, letting it be understood that he had\nnot told all and that there was something in his feelings for the Emperor not\neveryone could understand, and with his whole soul he shared the adoration"}, {"page": 418, "text": "then common in Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of as the “angel\nincarnate.”\nDuring Rostóv’s short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army, he did\nnot draw closer to Sónya, but rather drifted away from her.

When he thought of\nSónya, during this stay in Moscow, he said to himself, “Ah, there will be,\nand there are, many more such girls somewhere whom I do not yet know.\nThere will be time enough to think about love when I want to, but now I\nhave no time.” Besides, it seemed to him that the society of women was\nrather derogatory to his manhood.

The count had been a member and on the committee of the club\nfrom the day it was founded. To him the club entrusted the arrangement of\nthe festival in honor of Bagratión, for few men knew so well how to arrange\na feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale, and still fewer men would be\nso well able and willing to make up out of their own resources what might\nbe needed for the success of the fete. The club cook and the steward\nlistened to the count’s orders with pleased faces, for they knew that under\nno other management could they so easily extract a good profit for\nthemselves from a dinner costing several thousand rubles.\n“Well then, mind and have cocks’ comb in the turtle soup, you know!”\n“Shall we have three cold dishes then?” asked the cook.\nThe count considered.\n“We can’t have less—yes, three... the mayonnaise, that’s one,” said he,\nbending down a finger."}, {"page": 419, "text": "“Then am I to order those large sterlets?” asked the steward.\n“Yes, it can’t be helped if they won’t take less.

I must have two hundred pots here on Friday.”\nHaving given several more orders, he was about to go to his “little\ncountess” to have a rest, but remembering something else of importance, he\nreturned again, called back the cook and the club steward, and again began\ngiving orders. A light footstep and the clinking of spurs were heard at the\ndoor, and the young count, handsome, rosy, with a dark little mustache,\nevidently rested and made sleeker by his easy life in Moscow, entered the\nroom.\n“Ah, my boy, my head’s in a whirl!” said the old man with a smile, as if\nhe felt a little confused before his son. “Now, if you would only help a bit! I\nmust have singers too. I shall have my own orchestra, but shouldn’t we get\nthe gypsy singers as well? You military men like that sort of thing.”\n“Really, Papa, I believe Prince Bagratión worried himself less before the\nbattle of Schön Grabern than you do now,” said his son with a smile.\nThe old count pretended to be angry.\n“Yes, you talk, but try it yourself!”\nAnd the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd and respectful\nexpression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and son.\n“What have the young people come to nowadays, eh, Feoktíst?” said he.\n“Laughing at us old fellows!”\n“That’s so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good dinner,\nbut providing it and serving it all up, that’s not their business!”\n“That’s it, that’s it!” exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing his son by\nboth hands, he cried, “Now I’ve got you, so take the sleigh and pair at once,\nand go to Bezúkhov’s, and tell him ‘Count Ilyá has sent you to ask for\nstrawberries and fresh pineapples.’ We can’t get them from anyone else.\nHe’s not there himself, so you’ll have to go in and ask the princesses; and\nfrom there go on to the Rasgulyáy—the coachman Ipátka knows—and look"}, {"page": 420, "text": "up the gypsy Ilyúshka, the one who danced at Count Orlóv’s, you\nremember, in a white Cossack coat, and bring him along to me.”\n“And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?” asked Nicholas,\nlaughing. “Dear, dear!...”\nAt that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike,\npreoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never left her face, Anna\nMikháylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon the count in his\ndressing gown every day, he invariably became confused and begged her to\nexcuse his costume.\n“No matter at all, my dear count,” she said, meekly closing her eyes.\n“But I’ll go to Bezúkhov’s myself. Pierre has arrived, and now we shall get\nanything we want from his hothouses. I have to see him in any case. He has\nforwarded me a letter from Borís. Thank God, Borís is now on the staff.”\nThe count was delighted at Anna Mikháylovna’s taking upon herself one\nof his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her.\n“Tell Bezúkhov to come. I’ll put his name down. Is his wife with him?”\nhe asked.\nAnna Mikháylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was\ndepicted on her face.\n“Ah, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate,” she said. “If what we hear\nis true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a thing when we were\nrejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul as young\nBezúkhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give him what\nconsolation I can.”\n“Wh-what is the matter?” asked both the young and old Rostóv.\nAnna Mikháylovna sighed deeply.\n“Dólokhov, Mary Ivánovna’s son,” she said in a mysterious whisper, “has\ncompromised her completely, they say. Pierre took him up, invited him to\nhis house in Petersburg, and now... she has come here and that daredevil\nafter her!” said Anna Mikháylovna, wishing to show her sympathy for\nPierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her\nsympathy for the “daredevil,” as she called Dólokhov. “They say Pierre is\nquite broken by his misfortune.”\n“Dear, dear! But still tell him to come to the club—it will all blow over.\nIt will be a tremendous banquet.”"}, {"page": 421, "text": "Next day, the third of March, soon after one o’clock, two hundred and\nfifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the guest\nof honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince Bagratión, to dinner.\nOn the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow had\nbeen bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so used to victories that on\nreceiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it, while others\nsought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an event. In the\nEnglish Club, where all who were distinguished, important, and well\ninformed foregathered when the news began to arrive in December, nothing\nwas said about the war and the last battle, as though all were in a conspiracy\nof silence. The men who set the tone in conversation—Count Rostopchín,\nPrince Yúri Dolgorúkov, Valúev, Count Markóv, and Prince Vyázemski—\ndid not show themselves at the club, but met in private houses in intimate\ncircles, and the Moscovites who took their opinions from others—Ilyá\nRostóv among them—remained for a while without any definite opinion on\nthe subject of the war and without leaders. The Moscovites felt that\nsomething was wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult, and so\nit was best to be silent. But after a while, just as a jury comes out of its\nroom, the bigwigs who guided the club’s opinion reappeared, and\neverybody began speaking clearly and definitely. Reasons were found for\nthe incredible, unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat,\neverything became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things\nbegan to be said. These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, a\ndefective commissariat, the treachery of the Pole Przebyszéwski and of the\nFrenchman Langeron, Kutúzov’s incapacity, and (it was whispered) the\nyouth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had trusted worthless and\ninsignificant people. But the army, the Russian army, everyone declared,\nwas extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor. The soldiers, officers,\nand generals were heroes. But the hero of heroes was Prince Bagratión,\ndistinguished by his Schön Grabern affair and by the retreat from Austerlitz,\nwhere he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten\nback an enemy force twice as numerous as his own. What also conduced to\nBagratión’s being selected as Moscow’s hero was the fact that he had no\nconnections in the city and was a stranger there. In his person, honor was\nshown to a simple fighting Russian soldier without connections and\nintrigues, and to one who was associated by memories of the Italian\ncampaign with the name of Suvórov.

Kutúzov no\none spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers, calling him a court\nweathercock and an old satyr.\nAll Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorúkov’s saying: “If you go on\nmodeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay,” suggesting\nconsolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories; and the words\nof Rostopchín, that French soldiers have to be incited to battle by\nhighfalutin words, and Germans by logical arguments to show them that it\nis more dangerous to run away than to advance, but that Russian soldiers\nonly need to be restrained and held back! On all sides, new and fresh\nanecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by our\nofficers and men at Austerlitz. One had saved a standard, another had killed\nfive Frenchmen, a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded. Berg was\nmentioned, by those who did not know him, as having, when wounded in\nthe right hand, taken his sword in the left, and gone forward.

The\nmembers and guests of the club wandered hither and thither, sat, stood, met,\nand separated, some in uniform and some in evening dress, and a few here\nand there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftáns. Powdered footmen, in\nlivery with buckled shoes and smart stockings, stood at every door\nanxiously noting visitors’ every movement in order to offer their services.\nMost of those present were elderly, respected men with broad, self-\nconfident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures and voices. This class of\nguests and members sat in certain habitual places and met in certain\nhabitual groups. A minority of those present were casual guests—chiefly\nyoung men, among whom were Denísov, Rostóv, and Dólokhov—who was\nnow again an officer in the Semënov regiment. The faces of these young\npeople, especially those who were military men, bore that expression of\ncondescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older\ngeneration, “We are prepared to respect and honor you, but all the same\nremember that the future belongs to us.”\nNesvítski was there as an old member of the club. Pierre, who at his\nwife’s command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles, went\nabout the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull. Here, as\nelsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his\nwealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people, he treated\nthem with absent-minded contempt.\nBy his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by his\nwealth and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored\nguests, and so he went from one group to another. Some of the most\nimportant old men were the center of groups which even strangers\napproached respectfully to hear the voices of well-known men. The largest\ncircles formed round Count Rostopchín, Valúev, and Narýshkin.

Shinshín, standing close by, tried\nto make a joke, saying that Kutúzov had evidently failed to learn from\nSuvórov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a cock, but the\nelder members glanced severely at the wit, making him feel that in that\nplace and on that day, it was improper to speak so of Kutúzov.\nCount Ilyá Rostóv, hurried and preoccupied, went about in his soft boots\nbetween the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the important and\nunimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they were all equals, while his eyes\noccasionally sought out his fine well-set-up young son, resting on him and\nwinking joyfully at him. Young Rostóv stood at a window with Dólokhov,\nwhose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued. The old count\ncame up to them and pressed Dólokhov’s hand.\n“Please come and visit us... you know my brave boy... been together out\nthere... both playing the hero... Ah, Vasíli Ignátovich... How d’ye do, old\nfellow?” he said, turning to an old man who was passing, but before he had\nfinished his greeting there was a general stir, and a footman who had run in\nannounced, with a frightened face: “He’s arrived!”\nBells rang, the stewards rushed forward, and—like rye shaken together in\na shovel—the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms came\ntogether and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the\nballroom.\nBagratión appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword,\nwhich, in accord with the club custom, he had given up to the hall porter.\nHe had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded whip over his\nshoulder, as when Rostóv had seen him on the eve of the battle of\nAusterlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign Orders,\nand the Star of St. George on his left breast.

Bekleshëv and Theodore Uvárov, who had arrived with\nhim, paused at the doorway to allow him, as the guest of honor, to enter\nfirst. Bagratión was embarrassed, not wishing to avail himself of their\ncourtesy, and this caused some delay at the doors, but after all he did at last\nenter first. He walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the\nreception room, not knowing what to do with his hands; he was more\naccustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire, as he had done at the\nhead of the Kursk regiment at Schön Grabern—and he would have found\nthat easier. The committeemen met him at the first door and, expressing\ntheir delight at seeing such a highly honored guest, took possession of him\nas it were, without waiting for his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the\ndrawing room. It was at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for\nthe crowd of members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a\ngood look at Bagratión over each other’s shoulders, as if he were some rare\nanimal. Count Ilyá Rostóv, laughing and repeating the words, “Make way,\ndear boy! Make way, make way!” pushed through the crowd more\nenergetically than anyone, led the guests into the drawing room, and seated\nthem on the center sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members of the\nclub, beset the new arrivals. Count Ilyá, again thrusting his way through the\ncrowd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with\nanother committeeman, carrying a large silver salver which he presented to\nPrince Bagratión. On the salver lay some verses composed and printed in\nthe hero’s honor. Bagratión, on seeing the salver, glanced around in dismay,\nas though seeking help. But all eyes demanded that he should submit.\nFeeling himself in their power, he resolutely took the salver with both hands\nand looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented it to\nhim. Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagratión (or he would, it\nseemed, have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it) and\ndrew his attention to the verses.\n“Well, I will read them, then!” Bagratión seemed to say, and, fixing his\nweary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and serious\nexpression. But the author himself took the verses and began reading them\naloud. Bagratión bowed his head and listened:\nBring glory then to Alexander’s reign\nAnd on the throne our Titus shield.\nA dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,\nA Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!\nE’en fortunate Napoleon"}, {"page": 426, "text": "Knows by experience, now, Bagratión,\nAnd dare not Herculean Russians trouble...\nBut before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo announced\nthat dinner was ready!

Everyone rose, feeling that dinner was more\nimportant than verses, and Bagratión, again preceding all the rest, went in to\ndinner. He was seated in the place of honor between two Alexanders—\nBekleshëv and Narýshkin—which was a significant allusion to the name of\nthe sovereign. Three hundred persons took their seats in the dining room,\naccording to their rank and importance: the more important nearer to the\nhonored guest, as naturally as water flows deepest where the land lies\nlowest.\nJust before dinner, Count Ilyá Rostóv presented his son to Bagratión,\nwho recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed and awkward,\nas were all the words he spoke that day, and Count Ilyá looked joyfully and\nproudly around while Bagratión spoke to his son.\nNicholas Rostóv, with Denísov and his new acquaintance, Dólokhov, sat\nalmost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince\nNesvítski. Count Ilyá Rostóv with the other members of the committee sat\nfacing Bagratión and, as the very personification of Moscow hospitality, did\nthe honors to the prince.\nHis efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten and the\nother fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till the end of the\nmeal. He winked at the butler, whispered directions to the footmen, and\nawaited each expected dish with some anxiety. Everything was excellent.\nWith the second course, a gigantic sterlet (at sight of which Ilyá Rostóv\nblushed with self-conscious pleasure), the footmen began popping corks\nand filling the champagne glasses. After the fish, which made a certain\nsensation, the count exchanged glances with the other committeemen.\n“There will be many toasts, it’s time to begin,” he whispered, and taking up\nhis glass, he rose. All were silent, waiting for what he would say."}, {"page": 427, "text": "“To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!” he cried, and at the same\nmoment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm. The\nband immediately struck up “Conquest’s joyful thunder waken...” All rose\nand cried “Hurrah!” Bagratión also rose and shouted “Hurrah!” in exactly\nthe same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at Schön Grabern.\nYoung Rostóv’s ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred\nothers. He nearly wept. “To the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!” he\nroared, “Hurrah!” and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the\nfloor. Many followed his example, and the loud shouting continued for a\nlong time. When the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken\nglass and everybody sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and\nexchanging remarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying\nbeside his plate, and proposed a toast, “To the health of the hero of our last\ncampaign, Prince Peter Ivánovich Bagratión!” and again his blue eyes grew\nmoist. “Hurrah!” cried the three hundred voices again, but instead of the\nband a choir began singing a cantata composed by Paul Ivánovich Kutúzov:\nRussians!

At that toast, the count\ntook out his handkerchief and, covering his face, wept outright."}, {"page": 428, "text": "CHAPTER IV\nPierre sat opposite Dólokhov and Nicholas Rostóv. As usual, he ate and\ndrank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately noticed that\nsome great change had come over him that day. He was silent all through\ndinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed eyes and a\nlook of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his nose.\nHis face was depressed and gloomy. He seemed to see and hear nothing of\nwhat was going on around him and to be absorbed by some depressing and\nunsolved problem.\nThe unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by\nthe princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning Dólokhov’s intimacy with\nhis wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning, which\nin the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw\nbadly through his spectacles, but that his wife’s connection with Dólokhov\nwas a secret to no one but himself. Pierre absolutely disbelieved both the\nprincess’ hints and the letter, but he feared now to look at Dólokhov, who\nwas sitting opposite him. Every time he chanced to meet Dólokhov’s\nhandsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous rising\nin his soul and turned quickly away. Involuntarily recalling his wife’s past\nand her relations with Dólokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in\nthe letter might be true, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred\nto his wife. He involuntarily remembered how Dólokhov, who had fully\nrecovered his former position after the campaign, had returned to\nPetersburg and come to him. Availing himself of his friendly relations with\nPierre as a boon companion, Dólokhov had come straight to his house, and\nPierre had put him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled how Hélène had\nsmilingly expressed disapproval of Dólokhov’s living at their house, and\nhow cynically Dólokhov had praised his wife’s beauty to him and from that\ntime till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day."}, {"page": 429, "text": "“Yes, he is very handsome,” thought Pierre, “and I know him. It would be\nparticularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me, just\nbecause I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him, and helped\nhim. I know and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasure of\ndeceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it were true, but I do not believe\nit. I have no right to, and can’t, believe it.” He remembered the expression\nDólokhov’s face assumed in his moments of cruelty, as when tying the\npoliceman to the bear and dropping them into the water, or when he\nchallenged a man to a duel without any reason, or shot a post-boy’s horse\nwith a pistol. That expression was often on Dólokhov’s face when looking\nat him. “Yes, he is a bully,” thought Pierre, “to kill a man means nothing to\nhim. It must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must\nplease him. He must think that I, too, am afraid of him—and in fact I am\nafraid of him,” he thought, and again he felt something terrible and\nmonstrous rising in his soul. Dólokhov, Denísov, and Rostóv were now\nsitting opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. Rostóv was talking merrily to\nhis two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a\nnotorious duelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at\nPierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very\nnoticeable one at the dinner. Rostóv looked inimically at Pierre, first\nbecause Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of\na beauty, and in a word—an old woman; and secondly because Pierre in his\npreoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rostóv and had\nnot responded to his greeting. When the Emperor’s health was drunk,\nPierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his glass.\n“What are you about?” shouted Rostóv, looking at him in an ecstasy of\nexasperation. “Don’t you hear it’s His Majesty the Emperor’s health?”\nPierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting till all\nwere seated again, turned with his kindly smile to Rostóv.\n“Why, I didn’t recognize you!” he said. But Rostóv was otherwise\nengaged; he was shouting “Hurrah!”\n“Why don’t you renew the acquaintance?” said Dólokhov to Rostóv.\n“Confound him, he’s a fool!” said Rostóv.\n“One should make up to the husbands of pretty women,” said Denísov.\nPierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were talking\nabout him. He reddened and turned away."}, {"page": 430, "text": "“Well, now to the health of handsome women!” said Dólokhov, and with\na serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth, he\nturned with his glass to Pierre.\n“Here’s to the health of lovely women, Peterkin—and their lovers!” he\nadded.\nPierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at\nDólokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing leaflets\nwith Kutúzov’s cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the principal guests.\nHe was just going to take it when Dólokhov, leaning across, snatched it\nfrom his hand and began reading it. Pierre looked at Dólokhov and his eyes\ndropped, the something terrible and monstrous that had tormented him all\ndinnertime rose and took possession of him. He leaned his whole massive\nbody across the table.\n“How dare you take it?” he shouted.\nHearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesvítski and the\nneighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezúkhov.\n“Don’t! Don’t! What are you about?” whispered their frightened voices.\nDólokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that smile\nof his which seemed to say, “Ah! This is what I like!”\n“You shan’t have it!” he said distinctly.\nPale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.\n“You...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!” he ejaculated, and, pushing\nback his chair, he rose from the table.\nAt the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt that the\nquestion of his wife’s guilt which had been tormenting him the whole day\nwas finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative. He hated her and\nwas forever sundered from her. Despite Denísov’s request that he would\ntake no part in the matter, Rostóv agreed to be Dólokhov’s second, and after\ndinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with Nesvítski,\nBezúkhov’s second. Pierre went home, but Rostóv with Dólokhov and\nDenísov stayed on at the club till late, listening to the gypsies and other\nsingers.\n“Well then, till tomorrow at Sokólniki,” said Dólokhov, as he took leave\nof Rostóv in the club porch."}, {"page": 431, "text": "“And do you feel quite calm?” Rostóv asked.\nDólokhov paused.\n“Well, you see, I’ll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two words. If\nyou are going to fight a duel, and you make a will and write affectionate\nletters to your parents, and if you think you may be killed, you are a fool\nand are lost for certain. But go with the firm intention of killing your man\nas quickly and surely as possible, and then all will be right, as our bear\nhuntsman at Kostromá used to tell me. ‘Everyone fears a bear,’ he says, ‘but\nwhen you see one your fear’s all gone, and your only thought is not to let\nhim get away!’ And that’s how it is with me. À demain, mon cher.” *\n* Till tomorrow, my dear fellow.\nNext day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesvítski drove to the\nSokólniki forest and found Dólokhov, Denísov, and Rostóv already there.\nPierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no\nconnection with the matter in hand. His haggard face was yellow. He had\nevidently not slept that night. He looked about distractedly and screwed up\nhis eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He was entirely absorbed by two\nconsiderations: his wife’s guilt, of which after his sleepless night he had not\nthe slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of Dólokhov, who had no reason to\npreserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him.... “I should perhaps\nhave done the same thing in his place,” thought Pierre. “It’s even certain\nthat I should have done the same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I\nshall kill him, or he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee. Can’t I go\naway from here, run away, bury myself somewhere?” passed through his\nmind. But just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him, he would\nask in a particularly calm and absent-minded way, which inspired the\nrespect of the onlookers, “Will it be long? Are things ready?”\nWhen all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers,\nand the pistols loaded, Nesvítski went up to Pierre.\n“I should not be doing my duty, Count,” he said in timid tones, “and\nshould not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in\nchoosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very grave, moment I did\nnot tell you the whole truth. I think there is no sufficient ground for this\naffair, or for blood to be shed over it.... You were not right, not quite in the\nright, you were impetuous...”"}, {"page": 432, "text": "“Oh yes, it is horribly stupid,” said Pierre.\n“Then allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your opponent\nwill accept them,” said Nesvítski (who like the others concerned in the\naffair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not yet believe that the affair\nhad come to an actual duel). “You know, Count, it is much more honorable\nto admit one’s mistake than to let matters become irreparable. There was no\ninsult on either side. Allow me to convey....”\n“No! What is there to talk about?” said Pierre. “It’s all the same.... Is\neverything ready?” he added. “Only tell me where to go and where to\nshoot,” he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.\nHe took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the\ntrigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his hand—a fact that he did not\nwish to confess.\n“Oh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot,” said he.\n“No apologies, none whatever,” said Dólokhov to Denísov (who on his\nside had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to the\nappointed place.\nThe spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road, where\nthe sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine forest covered with\nmelting snow, the frost having begun to break up during the last few days.\nThe antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther edge of the clearing.\nThe seconds, measuring the paces, left tracks in the deep wet snow between\nthe place where they had been standing and Nesvítski’s and Dólokhov’s\nsabers, which were stuck into the ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier.\nIt was thawing and misty; at forty paces’ distance nothing could be seen.\nFor three minutes all had been ready, but they still delayed and all were\nsilent."}, {"page": 433, "text": "CHAPTER V\n“Well, begin!” said Dólokhov.\n“All right,” said Pierre, still smiling in the same way. A feeling of dread\nwas in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly begun could no longer\nbe averted but was taking its course independently of men’s will.\nDenísov first went to the barrier and announced: “As the adve’sawies\nhave wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. Take your pistols, and at\nthe word thwee begin to advance.\n“O-ne! T-wo! Thwee!” he shouted angrily and stepped aside.\nThe combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and nearer to\none another, beginning to see one another through the mist. They had the\nright to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier. Dólokhov\nwalked slowly without raising his pistol, looking intently with his bright,\nsparkling blue eyes into his antagonist’s face. His mouth wore its usual\nsemblance of a smile.\n“So I can fire when I like!” said Pierre, and at the word “three,” he went\nquickly forward, missing the trodden path and stepping into the deep snow.\nHe held the pistol in his right hand at arm’s length, apparently afraid of\nshooting himself with it. His left hand he held carefully back, because he\nwished to support his right hand with it and knew he must not do so.\nHaving advanced six paces and strayed off the track into the snow, Pierre\nlooked down at his feet, then quickly glanced at Dólokhov and, bending his\nfinger as he had been shown, fired. Not at all expecting so loud a report,\nPierre shuddered at the sound and then, smiling at his own sensations, stood\nstill. The smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him from seeing\nanything for an instant, but there was no second report as he had expected.\nHe only heard Dólokhov’s hurried steps, and his figure came in view\nthrough the smoke. He was pressing one hand to his left side, while the"}, {"page": 434, "text": "other clutched his drooping pistol. His face was pale. Rostóv ran toward\nhim and said something.\n“No-o-o!” muttered Dólokhov through his teeth, “no, it’s not over.” And\nafter stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber, he sank on the\nsnow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he wiped it on his coat and\nsupported himself with it. His frowning face was pallid and quivered.\n“Plea...” began Dólokhov, but could not at first pronounce the word.\n“Please,” he uttered with an effort.\nPierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward Dólokhov and\nwas about to cross the space between the barriers, when Dólokhov cried:\n“To your barrier!” and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by his\nsaber. Only ten paces divided them. Dólokhov lowered his head to the\nsnow, greedily bit at it, again raised his head, adjusted himself, drew in his\nlegs and sat up, seeking a firm center of gravity. He sucked and swallowed\nthe cold snow, his lips quivered but his eyes, still smiling, glittered with\neffort and exasperation as he mustered his remaining strength. He raised his\npistol and aimed.\n“Sideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!” ejaculated Nesvítski.\n“Cover yourself!” even Denísov cried to his adversary.\nPierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs\nhelplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing Dólokhov\nand looked sorrowfully at him. Denísov, Rostóv, and Nesvítski closed their\neyes. At the same instant they heard a report and Dólokhov’s angry cry.\n“Missed!” shouted Dólokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards on\nthe snow.\nPierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest,\ntrampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:\n“Folly... folly! Death... lies...” he repeated, puckering his face.\nNesvítski stopped him and took him home.\nRostóv and Denísov drove away with the wounded Dólokhov.\nThe latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer a\nword to the questions addressed to him. But on entering Moscow he\nsuddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort, took Rostóv, who was"}, {"page": 435, "text": "sitting beside him, by the hand. Rostóv was struck by the totally altered and\nunexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on Dólokhov’s face.\n“Well? How do you feel?” he asked.\n“Bad! But it’s not that, my friend—” said Dólokhov with a gasping\nvoice. “Where are we? In Moscow, I know. I don’t matter, but I have killed\nher, killed... She won’t get over it! She won’t survive....”\n“Who?” asked Rostóv.\n“My mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother,” and\nDólokhov pressed Rostóv’s hand and burst into tears.\nWhen he had become a little quieter, he explained to Rostóv that he was\nliving with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not survive it. He\nimplored Rostóv to go on and prepare her.\nRostóv went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise\nlearned that Dólokhov the brawler, Dólokhov the bully, lived in Moscow\nwith an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate of\nsons and brothers."}, {"page": 436, "text": "CHAPTER VI\nPierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg and in\nMoscow their house was always full of visitors. The night after the duel he\ndid not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained in his father’s\nroom, that huge room in which Count Bezúkhov had died.\nHe lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that had\nhappened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm of feelings, thoughts,\nand memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall asleep, nor\neven remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace the room with rapid\nsteps. Now he seemed to see her in the early days of their marriage, with\nbare shoulders and a languid, passionate look on her face, and then\nimmediately he saw beside her Dólokhov’s handsome, insolent, hard, and\nmocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and then that same face pale,\nquivering, and suffering, as it had been when he reeled and sank on the\nsnow.\n“What has happened?” he asked himself. “I have killed her lover, yes,\nkilled my wife’s lover. Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come to do\nit?”—“Because you married her,” answered an inner voice.\n“But in what was I to blame?” he asked. “In marrying her without loving\nher; in deceiving yourself and her.” And he vividly recalled that moment\nafter supper at Prince Vasíli’s, when he spoke those words he had found so\ndifficult to utter: “I love you.” “It all comes from that! Even then I felt it,”\nhe thought. “I felt then that it was not so, that I had no right to do it. And so\nit turns out.”\nHe remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection.\nParticularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection of how\none day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his study a\nlittle before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head steward\nthere, who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and at his dressing"}, {"page": 437, "text": "gown and smiled slightly, as if expressing respectful understanding of his\nemployer’s happiness.\n“But how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic beauty and\nsocial tact,” thought he; “been proud of my house, in which she received all\nPetersburg, proud of her unapproachability and beauty. So this is what I was\nproud of! I then thought that I did not understand her. How often when\nconsidering her character I have told myself that I was to blame for not\nunderstanding her, for not understanding that constant composure and\ncomplacency and lack of all interests or desires, and the whole secret lies in\nthe terrible truth that she is a depraved woman. Now I have spoken that\nterrible word to myself all has become clear.\n“Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her\nnaked shoulders. She did not give him the money, but let herself be kissed.\nHer father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied with a calm\nsmile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: ‘Let him do what he\npleases,’ she used to say of me. One day I asked her if she felt any\nsymptoms of pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and said she was not\na fool to want to have children, and that she was not going to have any\nchildren by me.”\nThen he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the\nvulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though she had been\nbrought up in the most aristocratic circles.\n“I’m not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allez-vous promener,” * she\nused to say. Often seeing the success she had with young and old men and\nwomen Pierre could not understand why he did not love her.\n* “You clear out of this.”\n“Yes, I never loved her,” said he to himself; “I knew she was a depraved\nwoman,” he repeated, “but dared not admit it to myself. And now there’s\nDólokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying, while\nmeeting my remorse with some forced bravado!”\nPierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance of what is\ncalled weak character, do not seek a confidant in their troubles. He digested\nhis sufferings alone.\n“It is all, all her fault,” he said to himself; “but what of that? Why did I\nbind myself to her? Why did I say ‘Je vous aime’ * to her, which was a lie,"}, {"page": 438, "text": "and worse than a lie? I am guilty and must endure... what? A slur on my\nname? A misfortune for life? Oh, that’s nonsense,” he thought. “The slur on\nmy name and honor—that’s all apart from myself.”\n* I love you.\n“Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a\ncriminal,” came into Pierre’s head, “and from their point of view they were\nright, as were those too who canonized him and died a martyr’s death for\nhis sake. Then Robespierre was beheaded for being a despot. Who is right\nand who is wrong? No one! But if you are alive—live: tomorrow you’ll die\nas I might have died an hour ago. And is it worth tormenting oneself, when\none has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity?”\nBut at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections,\nshe suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had\nmost strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he felt the blood rush\nto his heart and had again to get up and move about and break and tear\nwhatever came to his hand. “Why did I tell her that ‘Je vous aime’?” he\nkept repeating to himself. And when he had said it for the tenth time,\nMolière’s words: “Mais que diable allait-il faire dans cette galère?” *\noccurred to him, and he began to laugh at himself.\n* “But what the devil was he doing in that galley?”\nIn the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to\nPetersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her now. He\nresolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his\nintention to part from her forever.\nNext morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee, Pierre\nwas lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand.\nHe woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression,\nunable to realize where he was.\n“The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home,”\nsaid the valet.\nBut before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the countess\nherself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with\nsimply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like a\ncoronet) entered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was a"}, {"page": 439, "text": "wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow.

Pierre looked at her\ntimidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds who lays\nback her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her enemies, he\ntried to continue reading. But feeling this to be senseless and impossible, he\nagain glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down but looked at him with a\ncontemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to go.\n“Well, what’s this now? What have you been up to now, I should like to\nknow?” she asked sternly.\n“I? What have I...?” stammered Pierre.\n“So it seems you’re a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel about?\nWhat is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.”\nPierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but\ncould not reply.\n“If you won’t answer, I’ll tell you...” Hélène went on. “You believe\neverything you’re told. You were told...” Hélène laughed, “that Dólokhov\nwas my lover,” she said in French with her coarse plainness of speech,\nuttering the word amant as casually as any other word, “and you believed\nit! Well, what have you proved? What does this duel prove? That you’re a\nfool, que vous êtes un sot, but everybody knew that. What will be the\nresult? That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow, that everyone will\nsay that you, drunk and not knowing what you were about, challenged a\nman you are jealous of without cause.” Hélène raised her voice and became\nmore and more excited, “A man who’s a better man than you in every\nway...”\n“Hm... Hm...!” growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her, and not\nmoving a muscle.\n“And how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like his\ncompany? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer yours.”\n“Don’t speak to me... I beg you,” muttered Pierre hoarsely.\n“Why shouldn’t I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you plainly that\nthere are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not have\ntaken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,” said she."}, {"page": 440, "text": "Pierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose strange\nexpression she did not understand, and lay down again.

Very well, but only if you give me a fortune,” said Hélène.\n“Separate! That’s a thing to frighten me with!”\nPierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.\n“I’ll kill you!” he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table with a\nstrength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her brandishing the\nslab.\nHélène’s face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside.

What was worst of all for his\nrelations was the fact that there was still a possibility of his having been\npicked up on the battlefield by the people of the place and that he might\nnow be lying, recovering or dying, alone among strangers and unable to\nsend news of himself. The gazettes from which the old prince first heard of\nthe defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual very briefly and vaguely, that after\nbrilliant engagements the Russians had had to retreat and had made their\nwithdrawal in perfect order. The old prince understood from this official\nreport that our army had been defeated. A week after the gazette report of\nthe battle of Austerlitz came a letter from Kutúzov informing the prince of\nthe fate that had befallen his son.\n“Your son,” wrote Kutúzov, “fell before my eyes, a standard in his hand\nand at the head of a regiment—he fell as a hero, worthy of his father and his\nfatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the whole army it is still\nuncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort myself and you with the hope\nthat your son is alive, for otherwise he would have been mentioned among\nthe officers found on the field of battle, a list of whom has been sent me\nunder flag of truce.”\nAfter receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his\nstudy, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he was\nsilent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though he\nlooked very grim he said nothing to anyone.\nWhen Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his\nlathe and, as usual, did not look round at her."}, {"page": 442, "text": "“Ah, Princess Mary!” he said suddenly in an unnatural voice, throwing\ndown his chisel.

By the expression of her father’s face, not sad, not\ncrushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging over her\nand about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the worst in life, one\nshe had not yet experienced, irreparable and incomprehensible—the death\nof one she loved.\n“Father! Andrew!”—said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such an\nindescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father could\nnot bear her look but turned away with a sob.\n“Bad news!

She was already pale, but on\nhearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her\nbeautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joy—a supreme joy apart from the joys\nand sorrows of this world—overflowed the great grief within her. She\nforgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and drawing him\ndown put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck.\n“Father,” she said, “do not turn away from me, let us weep together.”\n“Scoundrels!

She looked at Princess Mary, then sat\nthinking for a while with that expression of attention to something within\nher that is only seen in pregnant women, and suddenly began to cry.\n“Has anything come from Andrew?” she asked.\n“No, you know it’s too soon for news.

Everyone in the house was"}, {"page": 447, "text": "dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced as she sat in\nher room. But owing to the superstition that the fewer the people who know\nof it the less a woman in travail suffers, everyone tried to pretend not to\nknow; no one spoke of it, but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful\ngood manners habitual in the prince’s household, a common anxiety, a\nsoftening of the heart, and a consciousness that something great and\nmysterious was being accomplished at that moment made itself felt.\nThere was no laughter in the maids’ large hall. In the men servants’ hall\nall sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfs’ quarters torches and\ncandles were burning and no one slept.

The pangs began again and Mary Bogdánovna advised Prince\nAndrew to leave the room.\nThe doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess Mary,\nagain joined her.

And\nthere in the coffin was the same face, though with closed eyes. “Ah, what\nhave you done to me?” it still seemed to say, and Prince Andrew felt that\nsomething gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin he could\nneither remedy nor forget.

But you don’t understand it.”\n“Oh, yes, I quite understand,” answered Rostóv, who was under his new\nfriend’s influence.\nIn the autumn the Rostóvs returned to Moscow. Early in the winter\nDenísov also came back and stayed with them. The first half of the winter\nof 1806, which Nicholas Rostóv spent in Moscow, was one of the happiest,\nmerriest times for him and the whole family. Nicholas brought many young\nmen to his parents’ house. Véra was a handsome girl of twenty; Sónya a girl\nof sixteen with all the charm of an opening flower; Natásha, half grown up\nand half child, was now childishly amusing, now girlishly enchanting.\nAt that time in the Rostóvs’ house there prevailed an amorous\natmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very\ncharming girls. Every young man who came to the house—seeing those\nimpressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably at their own\nhappiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fitful bursts\nof song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of young girls\nready for anything and full of hope—experienced the same feeling; sharing\nwith the young folk of the Rostóvs’ household a readiness to fall in love and\nan expectation of happiness.\nAmong the young men introduced by Rostóv one of the first was\nDólokhov, whom everyone in the house liked except Natásha. She almost\nquarreled with her brother about him. She insisted that he was a bad man,\nand that in the duel with Bezúkhov, Pierre was right and Dólokhov wrong,\nand further that he was disagreeable and unnatural."}, {"page": 455, "text": "“There’s nothing for me to understand,” she cried out with resolute self-\nwill, “he is wicked and heartless.

But Denísov...”\n“Oh, Denísov is quite different,” replied Nicholas, implying that even\nDenísov was nothing compared to Dólokhov—“you must understand what\na soul there is in Dólokhov, you should see him with his mother. What a\nheart!”\n“Well, I don’t know about that, but I am uncomfortable with him. And do\nyou know he has fallen in love with Sónya?”\n“What nonsense...”\n“I’m certain of it; you’ll see.”\nNatásha’s prediction proved true. Dólokhov, who did not usually care for\nthe society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the question for\nwhose sake he came (though no one spoke of it) was soon settled. He came\nbecause of Sónya. And Sónya, though she would never have dared to say\nso, knew it and blushed scarlet every time Dólokhov appeared.\nDólokhov often dined at the Rostóvs’, never missed a performance at\nwhich they were present, and went to Iogel’s balls for young people which\nthe Rostóvs always attended. He was pointedly attentive to Sónya and\nlooked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his glances\nwithout coloring, but even the old countess and Natásha blushed when they\nsaw his looks.\nIt was evident that this strange, strong man was under the irresistible\ninfluence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.\nRostóv noticed something new in Dólokhov’s relations with Sónya, but\nhe did not explain to himself what these new relations were. “They’re\nalways in love with someone,” he thought of Sónya and Natásha. But he\nwas not as much at ease with Sónya and Dólokhov as before and was less\nfrequently at home.\nIn the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with\nNapoleon with even greater warmth than the year before.

It was a grand farewell dinner, as he and Denísov were\nleaving to join their regiment after Epiphany. About twenty people were\npresent, including Dólokhov and Denísov.\nNever had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous\natmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the Rostóvs’ house as at this\nholiday time. “Seize the moments of happiness, love and be loved! That is\nthe only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one thing we are\ninterested in here,” said the spirit of the place.\nNicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without visiting\nall the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited, returned\nhome just before dinner. As soon as he entered he noticed and felt the\ntension of the amorous air in the house, and also noticed a curious\nembarrassment among some of those present. Sónya, Dólokhov, and the old\ncountess were especially disturbed, and to a lesser degree Natásha. Nicholas\nunderstood that something must have happened between Sónya and\nDólokhov before dinner, and with the kindly sensitiveness natural to him\nwas very gentle and wary with them both at dinner. On that same evening\nthere was to be one of the balls that Iogel (the dancing master) gave for his\npupils during the holidays.\n“Nicholas, will you come to Iogel’s? Please do!” said Natásha. “He asked\nyou, and Vasíli Dmítrich * is also going.”\n* Denísov.\n“Where would I not go at the countess’ command!” said Denísov, who at\nthe Rostóvs’ had jocularly assumed the role of Natásha’s knight. “I’m even\nweady to dance the pas de châle.”"}, {"page": 458, "text": "“If I have time,” answered Nicholas. “But I promised the Arkhárovs; they\nhave a party.”\n“And you?” he asked Dólokhov, but as soon as he had asked the question\nhe noticed that it should not have been put.\n“Perhaps,” coldly and angrily replied Dólokhov, glancing at Sónya, and,\nscowling, he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given Pierre at the\nclub dinner.\n“There is something up,” thought Nicholas, and he was further confirmed\nin this conclusion by the fact that Dólokhov left immediately after dinner.\nHe called Natásha and asked her what was the matter.\n“And I was looking for you,” said Natásha running out to him. “I told\nyou, but you would not believe it,” she said triumphantly. “He has proposed\nto Sónya!”\nLittle as Nicholas had occupied himself with Sónya of late, something\nseemed to give way within him at this news. Dólokhov was a suitable and\nin some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless, orphan girl. From the\npoint of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the question\nfor her to refuse him. And therefore Nicholas’ first feeling on hearing the\nnews was one of anger with Sónya.... He tried to say, “That’s capital; of\ncourse she’ll forget her childish promises and accept the offer,” but before\nhe had time to say it Natásha began again.\n“And fancy! she refused him quite definitely!” adding, after a pause, “she\ntold him she loved another.”\n“Yes, my Sónya could not have done otherwise!” thought Nicholas.\n“Much as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she won’t change\nonce she has said...”\n“And Mamma pressed her!” said Nicholas reproachfully.\n“Yes,” said Natásha. “Do you know, Nicholas—don’t be angry—but I\nknow you will not marry her. I know, heaven knows how, but I know for\ncertain that you won’t marry her.”\n“Now you don’t know that at all!” said Nicholas. “But I must talk to her.\nWhat a darling Sónya is!” he added with a smile.\n“Ah, she is indeed a darling!

She gave him an imploring, frightened look.\n“Nicholas, don’t tell me that!” she said.\n“No, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, but still it is best to say it. If\nyou refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole truth. I love you,\nand I think I love you more than anyone else....”\n“That is enough for me,” said Sónya, blushing.\n“No, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love again,\nthough for no one have I such a feeling of friendship, confidence, and love\nas I have for you.

The two pretty young\nPrincesses Gorchakóv met suitors there and were married and so further\nincreased the fame of these dances. What distinguished them from others\nwas the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the good-natured\nIogel, flying about like a feather and bowing according to the rules of his\nart, as he collected the tickets from all his visitors. There was the fact that\nonly those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves as girls of\nthirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for the first time.\nWith scarcely any exceptions they all were, or seemed to be, pretty—so\nrapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes.

He laid down the seven of hearts, on\nwhich with a broken bit of chalk he had written “800 rubles” in clear\nupright figures; he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed\nhim, smiled at Dólokhov’s words, and with a sinking heart, waiting for a\nseven to turn up, gazed at Dólokhov’s hands which held the pack. Much\ndepended on Rostóv’s winning or losing on that seven of hearts. On the\nprevious Sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles, and\nthough he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had told Nicholas\nthat this was all he could let him have till May, and asked him to be more\neconomical this time. Nicholas had replied that it would be more than\nenough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything\nmore till the spring. Now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that\nmoney, so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of\nsixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his word. With a\nsinking heart he watched Dólokhov’s hands and thought, “Now then, make\nhaste and let me have this card and I’ll take my cap and drive home to\nsupper with Denísov, Natásha, and Sónya, and will certainly never touch a\ncard again.” At that moment his home life, jokes with Pétya, talks with\nSónya, duets with Natásha, piquet with his father, and even his comfortable\nbed in the house on the Povarskáya rose before him with such vividness,\nclearness, and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated\nbliss, long past. He could not conceive that a stupid chance, letting the\nseven be dealt to the right rather than to the left, might deprive him of all\nthis happiness, newly appreciated and newly illumined, and plunge him into\nthe depths of unknown and undefined misery. That could not be, yet he\nawaited with a sinking heart the movement of Dólokhov’s hands. Those\nbroad, reddish hands, with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs,\nlaid down the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him.\n“So you are not afraid to play with me?” repeated Dólokhov, and as if\nabout to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his chair,\nand began deliberately with a smile:\n“Yes, gentlemen, I’ve been told there’s a rumor going about Moscow that\nI’m a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.”\n“Come now, deal!” exclaimed Rostóv.\n“Oh, those Moscow gossips!” said Dólokhov, and he took up the cards\nwith a smile."}, {"page": 467, "text": "“Aah!” Rostóv almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The seven\nhe needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He had lost more\nthan he could pay.\n“Still, don’t ruin yourself!” said Dólokhov with a side glance at Rostóv\nas he continued to deal."}, {"page": 468, "text": "CHAPTER XIV\nAn hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested in\ntheir own play.\nThe whole interest was concentrated on Rostóv. Instead of sixteen\nhundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him, which\nhe had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely supposed,\nmust have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it already exceeded twenty\nthousand rubles. Dólokhov was no longer listening to stories or telling\nthem, but followed every movement of Rostóv’s hands and occasionally ran\nhis eyes over the score against him. He had decided to play until that score\nreached forty-three thousand. He had fixed on that number because forty-\nthree was the sum of his and Sónya’s joint ages. Rostóv, leaning his head on\nboth hands, sat at the table which was scrawled over with figures, wet with\nspilled wine, and littered with cards. One tormenting impression did not\nleave him: that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible\nfrom under the shirt sleeves, those hands which he loved and hated, held\nhim in their power.\n“Six hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it back’s\nimpossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double or\nquits... it can’t be!... And why is he doing this to me?” Rostóv pondered.\nSometimes he staked a large sum, but Dólokhov refused to accept it and\nfixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him, and at one moment\nprayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over the Enns,\nand then guessed that the card that came first to hand from the crumpled\nheap under the table would save him, now counted the cords on his coat and\ntook a card with that number and tried staking the total of his losses on it,\nthen he looked round for aid from the other players, or peered at the now\ncold face of Dólokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind.\n“He knows of course what this loss means to me. He can’t want my ruin.\nWasn’t he my friend? Wasn’t I fond of him? But it’s not his fault. What’s he"}, {"page": 469, "text": "to do if he has such luck?... And it’s not my fault either,” he thought to\nhimself, “I have done nothing wrong. Have I killed anyone, or insulted or\nwished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible misfortune? And when did it\nbegin? Such a little while ago I came to this table with the thought of\nwinning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mamma’s name day and\nthen going home. I was so happy, so free, so lighthearted! And I did not\nrealize how happy I was! When did that end and when did this new, terrible\nstate of things begin? What marked the change? I sat all the time in this\nsame place at this table, chose and placed cards, and watched those broad-\nboned agile hands in the same way. When did it happen and what has\nhappened? I am well and strong and still the same and in the same place.\nNo, it can’t be! Surely it will all end in nothing!”\nHe was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot.\nHis face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its helpless efforts\nto seem calm.\nThe score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three thousand.\nRostóv had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he meant\nto double the three thousand just put down to his score, when Dólokhov,\nslamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began rapidly adding up\nthe total of Rostóv’s debt, breaking the chalk as he marked the figures in his\nclear, bold hand.\n“Supper, it’s time for supper! And here are the gypsies!”\nSome swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold\noutside and saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas understood\nthat it was all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:\n“Well, won’t you go on? I had a splendid card all ready,” as if it were the\nfun of the game which interested him most.\n“It’s all up! I’m lost!” thought he. “Now a bullet through my brain—\nthat’s all that’s left me!” And at the same time he said in a cheerful voice:\n“Come now, just this one more little card!”\n“All right!” said Dólokhov, having finished the addition. “All right!\nTwenty-one rubles,” he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one by which the\ntotal exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and taking up a pack\nhe prepared to deal. Rostóv submissively unbent the corner of his card and,\ninstead of the six thousand he had intended, carefully wrote twenty-one."}, {"page": 470, "text": "“It’s all the same to me,” he said. “I only want to see whether you will let\nme win this ten, or beat it.”\nDólokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how Rostóv detested at that\nmoment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists, which\nheld him in their power.... The ten fell to him.\n“You owe forty-three thousand, Count,” said Dólokhov, and stretching\nhimself he rose from the table. “One does get tired sitting so long,” he\nadded.\n“Yes, I’m tired too,” said Rostóv.\nDólokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for him to\njest.\n“When am I to receive the money, Count?”\nRostóv, flushing, drew Dólokhov into the next room.\n“I cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?” he said.\n“I say, Rostóv,” said Dólokhov clearly, smiling and looking Nicholas\nstraight in the eyes, “you know the saying, ‘Lucky in love, unlucky at\ncards.’ Your cousin is in love with you, I know.”\n“Oh, it’s terrible to feel oneself so in this man’s power,” thought Rostóv.\nHe knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother by the\nnews of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be to escape it all, and felt\nthat Dólokhov knew that he could save him from all this shame and sorrow,\nbut wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a mouse.\n“Your cousin...” Dólokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted him.\n“My cousin has nothing to do with this and it’s not necessary to mention\nher!” he exclaimed fiercely.\n“Then when am I to have it?”\n“Tomorrow,” replied Rostóv and left the room."}, {"page": 471, "text": "CHAPTER XV\nTo say “tomorrow” and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult, but to\ngo home alone, see his sisters, brother, mother, and father, confess and ask\nfor money he had no right to after giving his word of honor, was terrible.\nAt home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young people, after returning\nfrom the theater, had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord. As\nsoon as Nicholas entered, he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere of love\nwhich pervaded the Rostóv household that winter and, now after\nDólokhov’s proposal and Iogel’s ball, seemed to have grown thicker round\nSónya and Natásha as the air does before a thunderstorm. Sónya and\nNatásha, in the light-blue dresses they had worn at the theater, looking\npretty and conscious of it, were standing by the clavichord, happy and\nsmiling. Véra was playing chess with Shinshín in the drawing room. The\nold countess, waiting for the return of her husband and son, sat playing\npatience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house. Denísov, with\nsparkling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord striking chords with his\nshort fingers, his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he sang, with his\nsmall, husky, but true voice, some verses called “Enchantress,” which he\nhad composed, and to which he was trying to fit music:\nEnchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre\nWhat magic power is this recalls me still?\nWhat spark has set my inmost soul on fire,\nWhat is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill?\nHe was singing in passionate tones, gazing with his sparkling black-agate\neyes at the frightened and happy Natásha.\n“Splendid! Excellent!” exclaimed Natásha. “Another verse,” she said,\nwithout noticing Nicholas.\n“Everything’s still the same with them,” thought Nicholas, glancing into\nthe drawing room, where he saw Véra and his mother with the old lady."}, {"page": 472, "text": "“Ah, and here’s Nicholas!” cried Natásha, running up to him.\n“Is Papa at home?” he asked.\n“I am so glad you’ve come!” said Natásha, without answering him. “We\nare enjoying ourselves!

Come here, dear!” called the old countess\nfrom the drawing room.\nNicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently at her\ntable began to watch her hands arranging the cards. From the dancing room,\nthey still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade Natásha to\nsing.\n“All wight! All wight!” shouted Denísov. “It’s no good making excuses\nnow! It’s your turn to sing the ba’cawolla—I entweat you!”\nThe countess glanced at her silent son.\n“What is the matter?” she asked.\n“Oh, nothing,” said he, as if weary of being continually asked the same\nquestion. “Will Papa be back soon?”\n“I expect so.”\n“Everything’s the same with them. They know nothing about it!

But, though she noticed it, she was\nherself in such high spirits at that moment, so far from sorrow, sadness, or\nself-reproach, that she purposely deceived herself as young people often do.\n“No, I am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by sympathy with\nanyone’s sorrow,” she felt, and she said to herself: “No, I must be mistaken,\nhe must be feeling happy, just as I am.”\n“Now, Sónya!” she said, going to the very middle of the room, where she\nconsidered the resonance was best.\nHaving lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as ballet dancers\ndo, Natásha, rising energetically from her heels to her toes, stepped to the\nmiddle of the room and stood still.\n“Yes, that’s me!” she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with which\nDenísov followed her.\n“And what is she so pleased about?” thought Nicholas, looking at his\nsister. “Why isn’t she dull and ashamed?”\nNatásha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest rose, her eyes\nbecame serious. At that moment she was oblivious of her surroundings, and\nfrom her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may produce at the same\nintervals and hold for the same time, but which leave you cold a thousand\ntimes and the thousand and first time thrill you and make you weep.\nNatásha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing seriously, mainly\nbecause Denísov so delighted in her singing. She no longer sang as a child,\nthere was no longer in her singing that comical, childish, painstaking effect\nthat had been in it before; but she did not yet sing well, as all the\nconnoisseurs who heard her said: “It is not trained, but it is a beautiful voice\nthat must be trained.” Only they generally said this some time after she had\nfinished singing. While that untrained voice, with its incorrect breathing and\nlabored transitions, was sounding, even the connoisseurs said nothing, but\nonly delighted in it and wished to hear it again. In her voice there was a\nvirginal freshness, an unconsciousness of her own powers, and an as yet"}, {"page": 474, "text": "untrained velvety softness, which so mingled with her lack of art in singing\nthat it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling it.\n“What is this?” thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely opened\neyes. “What has happened to her? How she is singing today!” And suddenly\nthe whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note, the next\nphrase, and everything in the world was divided into three beats: “Oh mio\ncrudele affetto.”... One, two, three... one, two, three... One... “Oh mio\ncrudele affetto.”... One, two, three... One. “Oh, this senseless life of ours!”\nthought Nicholas. “All this misery, and money, and Dólokhov, and anger,\nand honor—it’s all nonsense... but this is real.... Now then, Natásha, now\nthen, dearest! Now then, darling! How will she take that si? She’s taken it!\nThank God!” And without noticing that he was singing, to strengthen the si\nhe sung a second, a third below the high note. “Ah, God! How fine! Did I\nreally take it? How fortunate!” he thought.\nOh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was\nfinest in Rostóv’s soul! And this something was apart from everything else\nin the world and above everything in the world. “What were losses, and\nDólokhov, and words of honor?... All nonsense!

A quarter of an hour later the old count came\nin from his club, cheerful and contented. Nicholas, hearing him drive up,\nwent to meet him.\n“Well—had a good time?” said the old count, smiling gaily and proudly\nat his son.\nNicholas tried to say “Yes,” but could not: and he nearly burst into sobs.\nThe count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son’s condition.\n“Ah, it can’t be avoided!” thought Nicholas, for the first and last time.\nAnd suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him feel ashamed of\nhimself, he said, as if merely asking his father to let him have the carriage\nto drive to town:\n“Papa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly forgetting. I\nneed some money.”\n“Dear me!” said his father, who was in a specially good humor. “I told\nyou it would not be enough. How much?”\n“Very much,” said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless smile,\nfor which he was long unable to forgive himself, “I have lost a little, I mean\na good deal, a great deal—forty three thousand.”\n“What! To whom?... Nonsense!” cried the count, suddenly reddening\nwith an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do.\n“I promised to pay tomorrow,” said Nicholas.\n“Well!...” said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking\nhelplessly on the sofa."}, {"page": 476, "text": "“It can’t be helped!

What nonsense!” she said, hoping it was a joke.\n“Nonsense, indeed!

No, but you are so nice... but it\nwon’t do...not that... but as a friend, I shall always love you.”\nDenísov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not\nunderstand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this instant, they\nheard the quick rustle of the countess’ dress. She came up to them.\n“Vasíli Dmítrich, I thank you for the honor,” she said, with an\nembarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to Denísov—“but my daughter\nis so young, and I thought that, as my son’s friend, you would have\naddressed yourself first to me.

At the\nTorzhók post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster would\nnot supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait.

And a bed got ready, and\ntea?” asked his valet.\nPierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw anything. He had\nbegun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same\nquestion—one so important that he took no notice of what went on around\nhim. Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to Petersburg earlier\nor later, or whether he secured accommodation at this station, but compared\nto the thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter of indifference\nwhether he remained there for a few hours or for the rest of his life.\nThe postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling Torzhók\nembroidery came into the room offering their services. Without changing\nhis careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over his spectacles unable to\nunderstand what they wanted or how they could go on living without\nhaving solved the problems that so absorbed him. He had been engrossed\nby the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from Sokólniki after\nthe duel and had spent that first agonizing, sleepless night. But now, in the\nsolitude of the journey, they seized him with special force. No matter what\nhe thought about, he always returned to these same questions which he\ncould not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself. It was as if the\nthread of the chief screw which held his life together were stripped, so that\nthe screw could not get in or out, but went on turning uselessly in the same\nplace.\nThe postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to\nwait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let his excellency"}, {"page": 482, "text": "have the courier horses. It was plain that he was lying and only wanted to\nget more money from the traveler.\n“Is this good or bad?” Pierre asked himself. “It is good for me, bad for\nanother traveler, and for himself it’s unavoidable, because he needs money\nfor food; the man said an officer had once given him a thrashing for letting\na private traveler have the courier horses. But the officer thrashed him\nbecause he had to get on as quickly as possible. And I,” continued Pierre,\n“shot Dólokhov because I considered myself injured, and Louis XVI was\nexecuted because they considered him a criminal, and a year later they\nexecuted those who executed him—also for some reason. What is bad?\nWhat is good? What should one love and what hate? What does one live\nfor? And what am I? What is life, and what is death? What power governs\nall?”\nThere was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and that not a\nlogical answer and not at all a reply to them. The answer was: “You’ll die\nand all will end. You’ll die and know all, or cease asking.” But dying was\nalso dreadful.\nThe Torzhók peddler woman, in a whining voice, went on offering her\nwares, especially a pair of goatskin slippers. “I have hundreds of rubles I\ndon’t know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered cloak looking\ntimidly at me,” he thought. “And what does she want the money for? As if\nthat money could add a hair’s breadth to happiness or peace of mind. Can\nanything in the world make her or me less a prey to evil and death?—death\nwhich ends all and must come today or tomorrow—at any rate, in an instant\nas compared with eternity.” And again he twisted the screw with the\nstripped thread, and again it turned uselessly in the same place.\nHis servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters, by\nMadame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous\nstruggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. “And why did she resist her\nseducer when she loved him?” he thought. “God could not have put into her\nheart an impulse that was against His will. My wife—as she once was—did\nnot struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been found out,\nnothing discovered,” Pierre again said to himself. “All we can know is that\nwe know nothing. And that’s the height of human wisdom.”\nEverything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and\nrepellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre found a"}, {"page": 483, "text": "kind of tantalizing satisfaction.\n“I make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this gentleman,”\nsaid the postmaster, entering the room followed by another traveler, also\ndetained for lack of horses.\nThe newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old man,\nwith gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite grayish\ncolor.\nPierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a bed that had\nbeen got ready for him, glancing now and then at the newcomer, who, with\na gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off his wraps with the aid of his\nservant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair of felt boots on his thin bony\nlegs, and keeping on a worn, nankeen-covered, sheepskin coat, the traveler\nsat down on the sofa, leaned back his big head with its broad temples and\nclose-cropped hair, and looked at Bezúkhov. The stern, shrewd, and\npenetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He felt a wish to speak to\nthe stranger, but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a question\nabout the roads, the traveler had closed his eyes. His shriveled old hands\nwere folded and on the finger of one of them Pierre noticed a large cast iron\nring with a seal representing a death’s head. The stranger sat without\nstirring, either resting or, as it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm\nmeditation. His servant was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard\nor mustache, evidently not because he was shaven but because they had\nnever grown. This active old servant was unpacking the traveler’s canteen\nand preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything was\nready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a tumbler\nwith tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom he passed\nit.

Call it what you please, I know that what happened to you in\nMoscow was a misfortune.”—“I regret it very much, my dear sir.”\nPierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent\nforward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.\n“I have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but for greater\nreasons.”\nHe paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa by way\nof inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt reluctant to enter\ninto conversation with this old man, but, submitting to him involuntarily,\ncame up and sat down beside him.\n“You are unhappy, my dear sir,” the stranger continued. “You are young\nand I am old.

Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom hast thou\ndenied?” he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in his\nvoice. “Who invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence came thy\nconception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being? didst thou,\nand why did the whole world, conceive the idea of the existence of such an\nincomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful, eternal, and infinite in all\nHis attributes?...”\nHe stopped and remained silent for a long time.\nPierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.\n“He exists, but to understand Him is hard,” the Mason began again,\nlooking not at Pierre but straight before him, and turning the leaves of his\nbook with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep still. “If\nit were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could bring him to thee,\ncould take him by the hand and show him to thee. But how can I, an\ninsignificant mortal, show His omnipotence, His infinity, and all His mercy\nto one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he may not see or understand\nHim and may not see or understand his own vileness and sinfulness?” He\npaused again. “Who art thou? Thou dreamest that thou art wise because\nthou couldst utter those blasphemous words,” he went on, with a somber\nand scornful smile. “And thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a\nlittle child, who, playing with the parts of a skillfully made watch, dares to\nsay that, as he does not understand its use, he does not believe in the master\nwho made it. To know Him is hard.... For ages, from our forefather Adam to\nour own day, we labor to attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far\nfrom our aim; but in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness\nand His greatness....”\nPierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Mason’s face with\nshining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but believing with his\nwhole soul what the stranger said.

He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness, in the\nMason’s arguments; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him. “I don’t\nunderstand,” he said, “how it is that the mind of man cannot attain the\nknowledge of which you speak.”\nThe Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.\n“The highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish to\nimbibe,” he said. “Can I receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel and\njudge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of myself can I retain in\nsome degree of purity the liquid I receive.”\n“Yes, yes, that is so,” said Pierre joyfully.\n“The highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not on those\nworldly sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into which\nintellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one. The highest\nwisdom has but one science—the science of the whole—the science\nexplaining the whole creation and man’s place in it. To receive that science\nit is necessary to purify and renew one’s inner self, and so before one can\nknow, it is necessary to believe and to perfect one’s self. And to attain this\nend, we have the light called conscience that God has implanted in our\nsouls.”\n“Yes, yes,” assented Pierre.\n“Look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit, and ask thyself\nwhether thou art content with thyself.

You have profited by their toil to lead a\nprofligate life. That is what you have done. Have you chosen a post in\nwhich you might be of service to your neighbor? No!

He wished to say, “Yes, a vile, idle, vicious life!” but\ndared not break the silence.\nThe Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called his\nservant.\n“How about the horses?” he asked, without looking at Pierre.\n“The exchange horses have just come,” answered the servant. “Will you\nnot rest here?”\n“No, tell them to harness.”\n“Can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me\nall, and without promising to help me?” thought Pierre, rising with\ndowncast head; and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at the\nMason. “Yes, I never thought of it, but I have led a contemptible and\nprofligate life, though I did not like it and did not want to,” thought Pierre.\n“But this man knows the truth and, if he wished to, could disclose it to me.”\nPierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to. The traveler,\nhaving packed his things with his practiced hands, began fastening his coat.\nWhen he had finished, he turned to Bezúkhov, and said in a tone of\nindifferent politeness:\n“Where are you going to now, my dear sir?”"}, {"page": 490, "text": "“I?...

He gulped and turned away.\nThe Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.\n“Help comes from God alone,” he said, “but such measure of help as our\nOrder can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to\nPetersburg. Hand this to Count Willarski” (he took out his notebook and\nwrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four). “Allow me to\ngive you a piece of advice.

Bazdéev had been one of the best-known Freemasons\nand Martinists, even in Novíkov’s time. For a long while after he had gone,\nPierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room,\npondering over his vicious past, and with a rapturous sense of beginning\nanew pictured to himself the blissful, irreproachable, virtuous future that\nseemed to him so easy. It seemed to him that he had been vicious only\nbecause he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous. Not a\ntrace of his former doubts remained in his soul. He firmly believed in the\npossibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of supporting one\nanother in the path of virtue, and that is how Freemasonry presented itself\nto him."}, {"page": 491, "text": "CHAPTER III\nOn reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival, he\nwent nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas à Kempis, whose\nbook had been sent him by someone unknown. One thing he continually\nrealized as he read that book: the joy, hitherto unknown to him, of believing\nin the possibility of attaining perfection, and in the possibility of active\nbrotherly love among men, which Joseph Alexéevich had revealed to him.\nA week after his arrival, the young Polish count, Willarski, whom Pierre\nhad known slightly in Petersburg society, came into his room one evening\nin the official and ceremonious manner in which Dólokhov’s second had\ncalled on him, and, having closed the door behind him and satisfied himself\nthat there was nobody else in the room, addressed Pierre.\n“I have come to you with a message and an offer, Count,” he said without\nsitting down. “A person of very high standing in our Brotherhood has made\napplication for you to be received into our Order before the usual term and\nhas proposed to me to be your sponsor. I consider it a sacred duty to fulfill\nthat person’s wishes. Do you wish to enter the Brotherhood of Freemasons\nunder my sponsorship?”\nThe cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always before\nmet at balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women,\nsurprised Pierre.\n“Yes, I do wish it,” said he.\nWillarski bowed his head.\n“One more question, Count,” he said, “which I beg you to answer in all\nsincerity—not as a future Mason but as an honest man: have you renounced\nyour former convictions—do you believe in God?”\nPierre considered.\n“Yes... yes, I believe in God,” he said.\n“In that case...” began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him."}, {"page": 492, "text": "“Yes, I do believe in God,” he repeated.\n“In that case we can go,” said Willarski. “My carriage is at your service.”\nWillarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierre’s inquiries as to what\nhe must do and how he should answer, Willarski only replied that brothers\nmore worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to tell the\ntruth.\nHaving entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had its\nheadquarters, and having ascended a dark staircase, they entered a small\nwell-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of a\nservant. From there they passed into another room. A man in strange attire\nappeared at the door. Willarski, stepping toward him, said something to him\nin French in an undertone and then went up to a small wardrobe in which\nPierre noticed garments such as he had never seen before. Having taken a\nkerchief from the cupboard, Willarski bound Pierre’s eyes with it and tied it\nin a knot behind, catching some hairs painfully in the knot. Then he drew\nhis face down, kissed him, and taking him by the hand led him forward. The\nhairs tied in the knot hurt Pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and\na shamefaced smile. His huge figure, with arms hanging down and with a\npuckered, though smiling face, moved after Willarski with uncertain, timid\nsteps.\nHaving led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.\n“Whatever happens to you,” he said, “you must bear it all manfully if you\nhave firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood.” (Pierre nodded\naffirmatively.) “When you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover your\neyes,” added Willarski. “I wish you courage and success,” and, pressing\nPierre’s hand, he went out.\nLeft alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Once or twice he\nshrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if wishing to\ntake it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes spent with his eyes\nbandaged seemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb, his legs almost gave\nway, it seemed to him that he was tired out. He experienced a variety of\nmost complex sensations. He felt afraid of what would happen to him and\nstill more afraid of showing his fear. He felt curious to know what was\ngoing to happen and what would be revealed to him; but most of all, he felt\njoyful that the moment had come when he would at last start on that path of\nregeneration and on the actively virtuous life of which he had been"}, {"page": 493, "text": "dreaming since he met Joseph Alexéevich. Loud knocks were heard at the\ndoor. Pierre took the bandage off his eyes and glanced around him. The\nroom was in black darkness, only a small lamp was burning inside\nsomething white. Pierre went nearer and saw that the lamp stood on a black\ntable on which lay an open book. The book was the Gospel, and the white\nthing with the lamp inside was a human skull with its cavities and teeth.\nAfter reading the first words of the Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word\nand the Word was with God,” Pierre went round the table and saw a large\nopen box filled with something. It was a coffin with bones inside. He was\nnot at all surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on an entirely new life\nquite unlike the old one, he expected everything to be unusual, even more\nunusual than what he was seeing. A skull, a coffin, the Gospel—it seemed\nto him that he had expected all this and even more. Trying to stimulate his\nemotions he looked around. “God, death, love, the brotherhood of man,” he\nkept saying to himself, associating these words with vague yet joyful ideas.\nThe door opened and someone came in.\nBy the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed, he\nsaw a rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the\ndarkness, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the table\nand placed on it his small leather-gloved hands.\nThis short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and\npart of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high white\nruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from below.\n“For what have you come hither?” asked the newcomer, turning in\nPierre’s direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. “Why have you, who\ndo not believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light, come\nhere? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?”\nAt the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre felt a\nsense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at\nconfession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete\nstranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man. With bated\nbreath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by which name the\nbrother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was\nknown). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew,\nSmolyanínov, and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an\nacquaintance—he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor."}, {"page": 494, "text": "For a long time he could not utter a word, so that the Rhetor had to repeat\nhis question.\n“Yes... I... I... desire regeneration,” Pierre uttered with difficulty.\n“Very well,” said Smolyanínov, and went on at once: “Have you any idea\nof the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach your aim?”\nsaid he quietly and quickly.\n“I... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration,” said Pierre, with a\ntrembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his excitement and\nto being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in Russian.\n“What is your conception of Freemasonry?”\n“I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who\nhave virtuous aims,” said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of his\nwords for the solemnity of the moment, as he spoke. “I imagine...”\n“Good!” said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with this answer.\n“Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion?”\n“No, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,” said Pierre, so\nsoftly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was saying.\n“I have been an atheist,” answered Pierre.\n“You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life,\ntherefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?” said the Rhetor, after\na moment’s pause.\n“Yes, yes,” assented Pierre.\nThe Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast, and\nbegan to speak.\n“Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,” he said, “and if\nthis aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood with profit.\nThe first and chief object of our Order, the foundation on which it rests and\nwhich no human power can destroy, is the preservation and handing on to\nposterity of a certain important mystery... which has come down to us from\nthe remotest ages, even from the first man—a mystery on which perhaps the\nfate of mankind depends. But since this mystery is of such a nature that\nnobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by long and diligent self-\npurification, not everyone can hope to attain it quickly. Hence we have a\nsecondary aim, that of preparing our members as much as possible to\nreform their hearts, to purify and enlighten their minds, by means handed"}, {"page": 495, "text": "on to us by tradition from those who have striven to attain this mystery, and\nthereby to render them capable of receiving it.\n“By purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to improve\nthe whole human race, offering it in our members an example of piety and\nvirtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which sways\nthe world. Think this over and I will come to you again.”\n“To combat the evil which sways the world...” Pierre repeated, and a\nmental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind. He\nimagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago, and he\naddressed an edifying exhortation to them. He imagined to himself vicious\nand unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed, imagined\noppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the three objects mentioned\nby the Rhetor, this last, that of improving mankind, especially appealed to\nPierre. The important mystery mentioned by the Rhetor, though it aroused\nhis curiosity, did not seem to him essential, and the second aim, that of\npurifying and regenerating himself, did not much interest him because at\nthat moment he felt with delight that he was already perfectly cured of his\nformer faults and was ready for all that was good.\nHalf an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the seven\nvirtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon’s temple, which every\nFreemason should cultivate in himself. These virtues were: 1. Discretion,\nthe keeping of the secrets of the Order. 2. Obedience to those of higher\nranks in the Order. 3. Morality. 4. Love of mankind. 5. Courage. 6.\nGenerosity. 7. The love of death.\n“In the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of death,” the Rhetor\nsaid, “to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but as a friend that\nfrees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this distressful life,\nand leads it to its place of recompense and peace.”\n“Yes, that must be so,” thought Pierre, when after these words the Rhetor\nwent away, leaving him to solitary meditation. “It must be so, but I am still\nso weak that I love my life, the meaning of which is only now gradually\nopening before me.” But five of the other virtues which Pierre recalled,\ncounting them on his fingers, he felt already in his soul: courage,\ngenerosity, morality, love of mankind, and especially obedience—which did\nnot even seem to him a virtue, but a joy. (He now felt so glad to be free\nfrom his own lawlessness and to submit his will to those who knew the"}, {"page": 496, "text": "indubitable truth.) He forgot what the seventh virtue was and could not\nrecall it.\nThe third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre\nwhether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to all\nthat would be required of him.\n“I am ready for everything,” said Pierre.\n“I must also inform you,” said the Rhetor, “that our Order delivers its\nteaching not in words only but also by other means, which may perhaps\nhave a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue than\nmere words. This chamber with what you see therein should already have\nsuggested to your heart, if it is sincere, more than words could do. You will\nperhaps also see in your further initiation a like method of enlightenment.\nOur Order imitates the ancient societies that explained their teaching by\nhieroglyphics. A hieroglyph,” said the Rhetor, “is an emblem of something\nnot cognizable by the senses but which possesses qualities resembling those\nof the symbol.”\nPierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not speak. He\nlistened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his ordeal was\nabout to begin.\n“If you are resolved, I must begin your initiation,” said the Rhetor\ncoming closer to Pierre. “In token of generosity I ask you to give me all\nyour valuables.”\n“But I have nothing here,” replied Pierre, supposing that he was asked to\ngive up all he possessed.\n“What you have with you: watch, money, rings....”\nPierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not manage for\nsome time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that had been\ndone, the Rhetor said:\n“In token of obedience, I ask you to undress.”\nPierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to the Rhetor’s\ninstructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierre’s left breast, and\nstooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to above the knee. Pierre\nhurriedly began taking off his right boot also and was going to tuck up the\nother trouser leg to save this stranger the trouble, but the Mason told him\nthat was not necessary and gave him a slipper for his left foot. With a"}, {"page": 497, "text": "childlike smile of embarrassment, doubt, and self-derision, which appeared\non his face against his will, Pierre stood with his arms hanging down and\nlegs apart, before his brother Rhetor, and awaited his further commands.\n“And now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief\npassion,” said the latter.\n“My passion! I have had so many,” replied Pierre.\n“That passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the\npath of virtue,” said the Mason.\nPierre paused, seeking a reply.\n“Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?” He\nwent over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to give the\npre-eminence.\n“Women,” he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.\nThe Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this\nanswer. At last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief that lay on\nthe table, again bound his eyes.\n“For the last time I say to you—turn all your attention upon yourself, put\na bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, not in passion but in your\nown heart. The source of blessedness is not without us but within....”\nPierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source of\nblessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion."}, {"page": 498, "text": "CHAPTER IV\nSoon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre, not the\nRhetor but Pierre’s sponsor, Willarski, whom he recognized by his voice. To\nfresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution Pierre replied: “Yes, yes,\nI agree,” and with a beaming, childlike smile, his fat chest uncovered,\nstepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and one booted foot, he\nadvanced, while Willarski held a sword to his bare chest. He was conducted\nfrom that room along passages that turned backwards and forwards and was\nat last brought to the doors of the Lodge. Willarski coughed, he was\nanswered by the Masonic knock with mallets, the doors opened before\nthem. A bass voice (Pierre was still blindfolded) questioned him as to who\nhe was, when and where he was born, and so on. Then he was again led\nsomewhere still blindfolded, and as they went along he was told allegories\nof the toils of his pilgrimage, of holy friendship, of the Eternal Architect of\nthe universe, and of the courage with which he should endure toils and\ndangers. During these wanderings, Pierre noticed that he was spoken of\nnow as the “Seeker,” now as the “Sufferer,” and now as the “Postulant,” to\nthe accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords. As he\nwas being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty\namong his conductors. He heard those around him disputing in whispers\nand one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet. After\nthat they took his right hand, placed it on something, and told him to hold a\npair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand and to repeat after\nsomeone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the laws of the Order. The\ncandles were then extinguished and some spirit lighted, as Pierre knew by\nthe smell, and he was told that he would now see the lesser light. The\nbandage was taken off his eyes and, by the faint light of the burning spirit,\nPierre, as in a dream, saw several men standing before him, wearing aprons\nlike the Rhetor’s and holding swords in their hands pointed at his breast.\nAmong them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with blood. On"}, {"page": 499, "text": "seeing this, Pierre moved forward with his breast toward the swords,\nmeaning them to pierce it. But the swords were drawn back from him and\nhe was at once blindfolded again.\n“Now thou hast seen the lesser light,” uttered a voice. Then the candles\nwere relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the bandage was\nagain removed and more than ten voices said together: “Sic transit gloria\nmundi.”\nPierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room\nand at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black sat some\ntwelve men in garments like those he had already seen. Some of them\nPierre had met in Petersburg society. In the President’s chair sat a young\nman he did not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck. On his\nright sat the Italian abbé whom Pierre had met at Anna Pávlovna’s two\nyears before. There were also present a very distinguished dignitary and a\nSwiss who had formerly been tutor at the Kurágins’. All maintained a\nsolemn silence, listening to the words of the President, who held a mallet in\nhis hand. Let into the wall was a star-shaped light. At one side of the table\nwas a small carpet with various figures worked upon it, at the other was\nsomething resembling an altar on which lay a Testament and a skull. Round\nit stood seven large candlesticks like those used in churches. Two of the\nbrothers led Pierre up to the altar, placed his feet at right angles, and bade\nhim lie down, saying that he must prostrate himself at the Gates of the\nTemple.\n“He must first receive the trowel,” whispered one of the brothers.\n“Oh, hush, please!” said another.\nPierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without\nobeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. “Where am I? What am I\ndoing? Aren’t they laughing at me? Shan’t I be ashamed to remember this?”\nBut these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at the serious faces\nof those around, remembered all he had already gone through, and realized\nthat he could not stop halfway. He was aghast at his hesitation and, trying to\narouse his former devotional feeling, prostrated himself before the Gates of\nthe Temple. And really, the feeling of devotion returned to him even more\nstrongly than before. When he had lain there some time, he was told to get\nup, and a white leather apron, such as the others wore, was put on him: he\nwas given a trowel and three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master"}, {"page": 500, "text": "addressed him. He told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the\nwhiteness of that apron, which symbolized strength and purity; then of the\nunexplained trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from\nvice, and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor. As to the\nfirst pair of gloves, a man’s, he said that Pierre could not know their\nmeaning but must keep them. The second pair of man’s gloves he was to\nwear at the meetings, and finally of the third, a pair of women’s gloves, he\nsaid: “Dear brother, these woman’s gloves are intended for you too. Give\nthem to the woman whom you shall honor most of all. This gift will be a\npledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to be your worthy\nhelpmeet in Masonry.” And after a pause, he added: “But beware, dear\nbrother, that these gloves do not deck hands that are unclean.” While the\nGrand Master said these last words it seemed to Pierre that he grew\nembarrassed. Pierre himself grew still more confused, blushed like a child\ntill tears came to his eyes, began looking about him uneasily, and an\nawkward pause followed.\nThis silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to the\nrug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of all\nthe figures on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a trowel, a\nrough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows, and so on. Then a\nplace was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs of the Lodge, told the\npassword, and at last was permitted to sit down. The Grand Master began\nreading the statutes. They were very long, and Pierre, from joy, agitation,\nand embarrassment, was not in a state to understand what was being read.\nHe managed to follow only the last words of the statutes and these remained\nin his mind.\n“In our temples we recognize no other distinctions,” read the Grand\nMaster, “but those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any\ndistinctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brother’s aid whoever he\nmay be, exhort him who goeth astray, raise him that falleth, never bear\nmalice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly and courteous. Kindle in all\nhearts the flame of virtue. Share thy happiness with thy neighbor, and may\nenvy never dim the purity of that bliss. Forgive thy enemy, do not avenge\nthyself except by doing him good. Thus fulfilling the highest law thou shalt\nregain traces of the ancient dignity which thou hast lost.”"}, {"page": 501, "text": "He finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, with tears\nof joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to answer the\ncongratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all sides.\nHe acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only brothers,\nand burned with impatience to set to work with them.\nThe Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the Masons sat down in\ntheir places, and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of\nhumility.\nThe Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed, and\nthe distinguished dignitary who bore the title of “Collector of Alms” went\nround to all the brothers. Pierre would have liked to subscribe all he had,\nbut fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the same amount as the\nothers.\nThe meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had\nreturned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years, had\nbecome completely changed, and had quite left behind his former habits\nand way of life."}, {"page": 502, "text": "CHAPTER V\nThe day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre was sitting at\nhome reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square,\none side of which symbolized God, another moral things, a third physical\nthings, and the fourth a combination of these. Now and then his attention\nwandered from the book and the Square and he formed in imagination a\nnew plan of life. On the previous evening at the Lodge, he had heard that a\nrumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it would be wiser for\nhim to leave Petersburg. Pierre proposed going to his estates in the south\nand there attending to the welfare of his serfs. He was joyfully planning this\nnew life, when Prince Vasíli suddenly entered the room.\n“My dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you\nquarreled with Hélène, mon cher? You are under a delusion,” said Prince\nVasíli, as he entered. “I know all about it, and I can tell you positively that\nHélène is as innocent before you as Christ was before the Jews.”\nPierre was about to reply, but Prince Vasíli interrupted him.\n“And why didn’t you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I know\nall about it and understand it all,” he said. “You behaved as becomes a man\nwho values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we won’t go into that. But\nconsider the position in which you are placing her and me in the eyes of\nsociety, and even of the court,” he added, lowering his voice. “She is living\nin Moscow and you are here. Remember, dear boy,” and he drew Pierre’s\narm downwards, “it is simply a misunderstanding. I expect you feel it so\nyourself. Let us write her a letter at once, and she’ll come here and all will\nbe explained, or else, my dear boy, let me tell you it’s quite likely you’ll\nhave to suffer for it.”\nPrince Vasíli gave Pierre a significant look.\n“I know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a keen\ninterest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to Hélène.”"}, {"page": 503, "text": "Pierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince Vasíli did not\nlet him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begin to speak in the tone\nof decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly resolved to\nanswer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words of the Masonic statutes, “be\nkindly and courteous,” recurred to him. He blinked, went red, got up and sat\ndown again, struggling with himself to do what was for him the most\ndifficult thing in life—to say an unpleasant thing to a man’s face, to say\nwhat the other, whoever he might be, did not expect. He was so used to\nsubmitting to Prince Vasíli’s tone of careless self-assurance that he felt he\nwould be unable to withstand it now, but he also felt that on what he said\nnow his future depended—whether he would follow the same old road, or\nthat new path so attractively shown him by the Masons, on which he firmly\nbelieved he would be reborn to a new life.\n“Now, dear boy,” said Prince Vasíli playfully, “say ‘yes,’ and I’ll write to\nher myself, and we will kill the fatted calf.”\nBut before Prince Vasíli had finished his playful speech, Pierre, without\nlooking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his father,\nmuttered in a whisper:\n“Prince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!” And he jumped up and\nopened the door for him.\n“Go!” he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of\nconfusion and fear that showed itself on Prince Vasíli’s face.\n“What’s the matter with you? Are you ill?”\n“Go!” the quivering voice repeated. And Prince Vasíli had to go without\nreceiving any explanation.\nA week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons,\nand leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his\nestates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons\nand promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity."}, {"page": 504, "text": "CHAPTER VI\nThe duel between Pierre and Dólokhov was hushed up and, in spite of the\nEmperor’s severity regarding duels at that time, neither the principals nor\ntheir seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel, confirmed by Pierre’s\nrupture with his wife, was the talk of society. Pierre who had been regarded\nwith patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate son, and petted\nand extolled when he was the best match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the\nesteem of society after his marriage—when the marriageable daughters and\ntheir mothers had nothing to hope from him—especially as he did not know\nhow, and did not wish, to court society’s favor. Now he alone was blamed\nfor what had happened, he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like\nhis father to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after Pierre’s departure\nHélène returned to Petersburg, she was received by all her acquaintances\nnot only cordially, but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune.\nWhen conversation turned on her husband Hélène assumed a dignified\nexpression, which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she did\nnot understand its significance. This expression suggested that she had\nresolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband was a\ncross laid upon her by God. Prince Vasíli expressed his opinion more\nopenly. He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre was mentioned and,\npointing to his forehead, remarked:\n“A bit touched—I always said so.”\n“I said from the first,” declared Anna Pávlovna referring to Pierre, “I said\nat the time and before anyone else” (she insisted on her priority) “that that\nsenseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of these days. I said\nso even at the time when everybody was in raptures about him, when he had\njust returned from abroad, and when, if you remember, he posed as a sort of\nMarat at one of my soirees. And how has it ended? I was against this\nmarriage even then and foretold all that has happened.”"}, {"page": 505, "text": "Anna Pávlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of\nsoirees as before—such as she alone had the gift of arranging—at which\nwas to be found “the cream of really good society, the bloom of the\nintellectual essence of Petersburg,” as she herself put it. Besides this refined\nselection of society Anna Pávlovna’s receptions were also distinguished by\nthe fact that she always presented some new and interesting person to the\nvisitors and that nowhere else was the state of the political thermometer of\nlegitimate Petersburg court society so dearly and distinctly indicated.\nToward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon’s\ndestruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstädt and the surrender of\nmost of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our troops had\nalready entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon was beginning,\nAnna Pávlovna gave one of her soirees. The “cream of really good society”\nconsisted of the fascinating Hélène, forsaken by her husband, Mortemart,\nthe delightful Prince Hippolyte who had just returned from Vienna, two\ndiplomatists, the old aunt, a young man referred to in that drawing room as\n“a man of great merit” (un homme de beaucoup de mérite), a newly\nappointed maid of honor and her mother, and several other less noteworthy\npersons.\nThe novelty Anna Pávlovna was setting before her guests that evening\nwas Borís Drubetskóy, who had just arrived as a special messenger from the\nPrussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.\nThe temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that\nevening was this:\n“Whatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to\ncountenance Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, annoyance and\nmortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. We shall not cease to\nexpress our sincere views on that subject, and can only say to the King of\nPrussia and others: ‘So much the worse for you. Tu l’as voulu, George\nDandin,’ that’s all we have to say about it!”\nWhen Borís, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the drawing\nroom, almost all the company had assembled, and the conversation, guided\nby Anna Pávlovna, was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and the\nhope of an alliance with her.\nBorís, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and self-possessed,\nentered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aide-de-"}, {"page": 506, "text": "camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and then\nbrought back to the general circle.\nAnna Pávlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him\nto several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered\ndescription of each.\n“Prince Hippolyte Kurágin—charming young fellow; M. Kronq,—chargé\nd’affaires from Copenhagen—a profound intellect,” and simply, “Mr.\nShítov—a man of great merit”—this of the man usually so described.\nThanks to Anna Mikháylovna’s efforts, his own tastes, and the\npeculiarities of his reserved nature, Borís had managed during his service to\nplace himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a very\nimportant personage, had been sent on a very important mission to Prussia,\nand had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had become\nthoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had been so\npleased at Olmütz and according to which an ensign might rank\nincomparably higher than a general, and according to which what was\nneeded for success in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or\nperseverance, but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can\ngrant rewards, and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his\nsuccess and at the inability of others to understand these things. In\nconsequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, all his relations\nwith old friends, all his plans for his future, were completely altered. He\nwas not rich, but would spend his last groat to be better dressed than others,\nand would rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to\nbe seen in a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of Petersburg in an old\nuniform. He made friends with and sought the acquaintance of only those\nabove him in position and who could therefore be of use to him. He liked\nPetersburg and despised Moscow. The remembrance of the Rostóvs’ house\nand of his childish love for Natásha was unpleasant to him and he had not\nonce been to see the Rostóvs since the day of his departure for the army. To\nbe in Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room he considered an important step up in\nthe service, and he at once understood his role, letting his hostess make use\nof whatever interest he had to offer. He himself carefully scanned each face,\nappraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with each of those\npresent, and the advantages that might accrue. He took the seat indicated to\nhim beside the fair Hélène and listened to the general conversation."}, {"page": 507, "text": "“Vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that\nnot even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them, and she\ndoubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the actual phrase used\nby the Vienna cabinet,” said the Danish chargé d’affaires.\n“The doubt is flattering,” said “the man of profound intellect,” with a\nsubtle smile.\n“We must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of\nAustria,” said Mortemart. “The Emperor of Austria can never have thought\nof such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it.”\n“Ah, my dear vicomte,” put in Anna Pávlovna, “L’Urope” (for some\nreason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined French\npronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a\nFrenchman), “L’Urope ne sera jamais notre alliée sincère.” *\n* “Europe will never be our sincere ally.”\nAfter that Anna Pávlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King\nof Prussia, in order to draw Borís into the conversation.\nBorís listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting his turn, but\nmanaged meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor, the beautiful\nHélène, whose eyes several times met those of the handsome young aide-\nde-camp with a smile.\nSpeaking of the position of Prussia, Anna Pávlovna very naturally asked\nBorís to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he found\nthe Prussian army. Borís, speaking with deliberation, told them in pure,\ncorrect French many interesting details about the armies and the court,\ncarefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about the facts\nhe was recounting. For some time he engrossed the general attention, and\nAnna Pávlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was received with\npleasure by all her visitors. The greatest attention of all to Borís’ narrative\nwas shown by Hélène. She asked him several questions about his journey\nand seemed greatly interested in the state of the Prussian army. As soon as\nhe had finished she turned to him with her usual smile.\n“You absolutely must come and see me,” she said in a tone that implied\nthat, for certain considerations he could not know of, this was absolutely\nnecessary.\n“On Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure.”"}, {"page": 508, "text": "Borís promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation\nwith her, when Anna Pávlovna called him away on the pretext that her aunt\nwished to hear him.\n“You know her husband, of course?” said Anna Pávlovna, closing her\neyes and indicating Hélène with a sorrowful gesture. “Ah, she is such an\nunfortunate and charming woman!

Everyone turned toward him.\n“Le Roi de Prusse?” Hippolyte said interrogatively, again laughing, and\nthen calmly and seriously sat back in his chair. Anna Pávlovna waited for\nhim to go on, but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she began to\ntell of how at Potsdam the impious Bonaparte had stolen the sword of\nFrederick the Great.\n“It is the sword of Frederick the Great which I...” she began, but\nHippolyte interrupted her with the words: “Le Roi de Prusse...” and again,\nas soon as all turned toward him, excused himself and said no more.\nAnna Pávlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hippolyte’s friend, addressed him\nfirmly.\n“Come now, what about your Roi de Prusse?”\nHippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing.\n“Oh, it’s nothing. I only wished to say...” (he wanted to repeat a joke he\nhad heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to get in)\n“I only wished to say that we are wrong to fight pour le Roi de Prusse!”\nBorís smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical or\nappreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody\nlaughed.\n“Your joke is too bad, it’s witty but unjust,” said Anna Pávlovna, shaking\nher little shriveled finger at him.\n“We are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse, but for right principles.

A snuffbox with the Emperor’s portrait is a reward but not a\ndistinction,” said the diplomatist—“a gift, rather.”\n“There are precedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg.”\n“It’s impossible,” replied another.\n“Will you bet? The ribbon of the order is a different matter....”\nWhen everybody rose to go, Hélène who had spoken very little all the\nevening again turned to Borís, asking him in a tone of caressing significant\ncommand to come to her on Tuesday.\n“It is of great importance to me,” she said, turning with a smile toward\nAnna Pávlovna, and Anna Pávlovna, with the same sad smile with which\nshe spoke of her exalted patroness, supported Hélène’s wish.\nIt seemed as if from some words Borís had spoken that evening about the\nPrussian army, Hélène had suddenly found it necessary to see him. She\nseemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on\nTuesday.\nBut on Tuesday evening, having come to Hélène’s splendid salon, Borís\nreceived no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come.\nThere were other guests and the countess talked little to him, and only as he\nkissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a whisper, with a\nstrangely unsmiling face: “Come to dinner tomorrow... in the evening.

Everywhere\none heard curses on Bonaparte, “the enemy of mankind.” Militiamen and\nrecruits were being enrolled in the villages, and from the seat of war came\ncontradictory news, false as usual and therefore variously interpreted. The\nlife of old Prince Bolkónski, Prince Andrew, and Princess Mary had greatly\nchanged since 1805.\nIn 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief\nthen appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia.\nDespite the weakness of age, which had become particularly noticeable\nsince the time when he thought his son had been killed, he did not think it\nright to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Emperor\nhimself, and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy and\nstrength. He was continually traveling through the three provinces entrusted\nto him, was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties, severe to cruel with his\nsubordinates, and went into everything down to the minutest details\nhimself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics from her\nfather, and when the old prince was at home went to his study with the wet\nnurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his grandfather called him). The baby\nPrince Nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse Sávishna in the late\nprincess’ rooms and Princess Mary spent most of the day in the nursery,\ntaking a mother’s place to her little nephew as best she could. Mademoiselle\nBourienne, too, seemed passionately fond of the boy, and Princess Mary\noften deprived herself to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little\nangel—as she called her nephew—and playing with him.\nNear the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the\ntomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument\nbrought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to fly\nupwards. The angel’s upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile,\nand once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary"}, {"page": 512, "text": "admitted to one another that the angel’s face reminded them strangely of the\nlittle princess. But what was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew\nsaid nothing to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor had\nhappened to give the angel’s face, Prince Andrew read the same mild\nreproach he had read on the face of his dead wife: “Ah, why have you done\nthis to me?”\nSoon after Prince Andrew’s return the old prince made over to him a\nlarge estate, Boguchárovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills. Partly\nbecause of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills, partly\nbecause Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his\nfather’s peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude, Prince Andrew\nmade use of Boguchárovo, began building and spent most of his time there.\nAfter the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to\ncontinue his military service, and when the war recommenced and\neverybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the recruitment so\nas to avoid active service. The old prince and his son seemed to have\nchanged roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man, roused by activity,\nexpected the best results from the new campaign, while Prince Andrew on\nthe contrary, taking no part in the war and secretly regretting this, saw only\nthe dark side.\nOn February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits. Prince\nAndrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his father’s absence. Little\nNicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who had driven the\nold prince to town returned bringing papers and letters for Prince Andrew.\nNot finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the letters\nto Princess Mary’s apartments, but did not find him there. He was told that\nthe prince had gone to the nursery.\n“If you please, your excellency, Pétrusha has brought some papers,” said\none of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a child’s little\nchair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he poured drops from a\nmedicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water.\n“What is it?” he said crossly, and, his hand shaking unintentionally, he\npoured too many drops into the glass. He threw the mixture onto the floor\nand asked for some more water. The maid brought it.\nThere were in the room a child’s cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a table, a\nchild’s table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew was sitting. The"}, {"page": 513, "text": "curtains were drawn, and a single candle was burning on the table, screened\nby a bound music book so that the light did not fall on the cot.\n“My dear,” said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside the\ncot where she was standing, “better wait a bit... later...”\n“Oh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things off—\nand this is what comes of it!” said Prince Andrew in an exasperated\nwhisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.\n“My dear, really... it’s better not to wake him... he’s asleep,” said the\nprincess in a tone of entreaty.\nPrince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, wineglass in\nhand.\n“Perhaps we’d really better not wake him,” he said hesitating.\n“As you please... really... I think so... but as you please,” said Princess\nMary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had prevailed.\nShe drew her brother’s attention to the maid who was calling him in a\nwhisper.\nIt was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the boy\nwho was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their household doctor\nand expecting another for whom they had sent to town, they had been trying\nfirst one remedy and then another. Worn out by sleeplessness and anxiety\nthey threw their burden of sorrow on one another and reproached and\ndisputed with each other.\n“Pétrusha has come with papers from your father,” whispered the maid.\nPrince Andrew went out.\n“Devil take them!” he muttered, and after listening to the verbal\ninstructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his\nfather’s letter, he returned to the nursery.\n“Well?” he asked.\n“Still the same. Wait, for heaven’s sake. Karl Ivánich always says that\nsleep is more important than anything,” whispered Princess Mary with a\nsigh.\nPrince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.\n“Confound you and your Karl Ivánich!” He took the glass with the drops\nand again went up to the cot."}, {"page": 514, "text": "“Andrew, don’t!” said Princess Mary.\nBut he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes, and\nstooped glass in hand over the infant.\n“But I wish it,” he said. “I beg you—give it him!”\nPrincess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively\nand calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed\nhoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and sat\ndown on a sofa in the next room.\nHe still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them mechanically he\nbegan reading. The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, wrote in\nhis large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:\nHave just this moment received by special messenger very joyful news—\nif it’s not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete victory over\nBuonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing, and the rewards\nsent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a German—I congratulate\nhim! I can’t make out what the commander at Kórchevo—a certain\nKhandrikóv—is up to; till now the additional men and provisions have not\narrived. Gallop off to him at once and say I’ll have his head off if\neverything is not here in a week. Have received another letter about the\nPreussisch-Eylau battle from Pétenka—he took part in it—and it’s all true.\nWhen mischief-makers don’t meddle even a German beats Buonaparte. He\nis said to be fleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop off to Kórchevo\nwithout delay and carry out instructions!\nPrince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It was a\nclosely written letter of two sheets from Bilíbin. He folded it up without\nreading it and reread his father’s letter, ending with the words: “Gallop off\nto Kórchevo and carry out instructions!”\n“No, pardon me, I won’t go now till the child is better,” thought he, going\nto the door and looking into the nursery.\nPrincess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the baby.\n“Ah yes, and what else did he say that’s unpleasant?” thought Prince\nAndrew, recalling his father’s letter. “Yes, we have gained a victory over\nBonaparte, just when I’m not serving. Yes, yes, he’s always poking fun at\nme.... Ah, well! Let him!” And he began reading Bilíbin’s letter which was\nwritten in French. He read without understanding half of it, read only to"}, {"page": 515, "text": "forget, if but for a moment, what he had too long been thinking of so\npainfully to the exclusion of all else."}, {"page": 516, "text": "CHAPTER IX\nBilíbin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and\nthough he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms, he\ndescribed the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and self-derision\ngenuinely Russian. Bilíbin wrote that the obligation of diplomatic discretion\ntormented him, and he was happy to have in Prince Andrew a reliable\ncorrespondent to whom he could pour out the bile he had accumulated at\nthe sight of all that was being done in the army. The letter was old, having\nbeen written before the battle at Preussisch-Eylau.\n“Since the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz,” wrote Bilíbin, “as\nyou know, my dear prince, I never leave headquarters. I have certainly\nacquired a taste for war, and it is just as well for me; what I have seen\nduring these last three months is incredible.\n“I begin ab ovo. ‘The enemy of the human race,’ as you know, attacks the\nPrussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us\nthree times in three years. We take up their cause, but it turns out that ‘the\nenemy of the human race’ pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude\nand savage way throws himself on the Prussians without giving them time\nto finish the parade they had begun, and in two twists of the hand he breaks\nthem to smithereens and installs himself in the palace at Potsdam.\n“‘I most ardently desire,’ writes the King of Prussia to Bonaparte, ‘that\nYour Majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a manner\nagreeable to yourself, and in so far as circumstances allowed, I have\nhastened to take all steps to that end. May I have succeeded!’ The Prussian\ngenerals pride themselves on being polite to the French and lay down their\narms at the first demand.\n“The head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the\nKing of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All this is\nabsolutely true."}, {"page": 517, "text": "“In short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude, it turns\nout that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more, in war on our\nown frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have everything in\nperfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely, a commander in chief.\nAs it was considered that the Austerlitz success might have been more\ndecisive had the commander in chief not been so young, all our\noctogenarians were reviewed, and of Prozoróvski and Kámenski the latter\nwas preferred. The general comes to us, Suvórov-like, in a kibítka, and is\nreceived with acclamations of joy and triumph.\n“On the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails are taken\nto the field marshal’s room, for he likes to do everything himself. I am\ncalled in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us. The field\nmarshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to him. We search, but\nnone are to be found. The field marshal grows impatient and sets to work\nhimself and finds letters from the Emperor to Count T., Prince V., and\nothers. Then he bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and\neverything, seizes the letters, opens them, and reads those from the Emperor\naddressed to others. ‘Ah! So that’s the way they treat me! No confidence in\nme! Ah, ordered to keep an eye on me! Very well then! Get along with\nyou!’ So he writes the famous order of the day to General Bennigsen:\n“‘I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the\narmy. You have brought your army corps to Pultúsk, routed: here it is\nexposed, and without fuel or forage, so something must be done, and, as\nyou yourself reported to Count Buxhöwden yesterday, you must think of\nretreating to our frontier—which do today.’\n“‘From all my riding,’ he writes to the Emperor, ‘I have got a saddle sore\nwhich, coming after all my previous journeys, quite prevents my riding and\ncommanding so vast an army, so I have passed on the command to the\ngeneral next in seniority, Count Buxhöwden, having sent him my whole\nstaff and all that belongs to it, advising him if there is a lack of bread, to\nmove farther into the interior of Prussia, for only one day’s ration of bread\nremains, and in some regiments none at all, as reported by the division\ncommanders, Ostermann and Sedmorétzki, and all that the peasants had has\nbeen eaten up. I myself will remain in hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover.\nIn regard to which I humbly submit my report, with the information that if"}, {"page": 518, "text": "the army remains in its present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a\nhealthy man left in it by spring.\n“‘Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already in\nany case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious task for\nwhich he was chosen. I shall await your most gracious permission here in\nhospital, that I may not have to play the part of a secretary rather than\ncommander in the army. My removal from the army does not produce the\nslightest stir—a blind man has left it. There are thousands such as I in\nRussia.’\n“The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all, isn’t\nit logical?\n“This is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly\ninteresting and entertaining. After the field marshal’s departure it appears\nthat we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle. Buxhöwden is\ncommander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does not quite see\nit; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the\nenemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle ‘on his\nown hand’ as the Germans say. He does so. This is the battle of Pultúsk,\nwhich is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the\nkind. We civilians, as you know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a\nbattle was won or lost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what\nwe say; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pultúsk. In\nshort, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news\nof a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the\npost of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the\ncommand of the army to General Buxhöwden. During this interregnum we\nbegin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is no\nlonger, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid\nGeneral Buxhöwden who by right of seniority should be our chief. So\nenergetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable river\nwe burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, who at the\nmoment is not Bonaparte but Buxhöwden. General Buxhöwden was all but\nattacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of these\nmaneuvers that enabled us to escape him. Buxhöwden pursues us—we\nscuttle. He hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to the\nother. At last our enemy, Buxhöwden, catches us and attacks. Both generals"}, {"page": 519, "text": "are angry, and the result is a challenge on Buxhöwden’s part and an\nepileptic fit on Bennigsen’s. But at the critical moment the courier who\ncarried the news of our victory at Pultúsk to Petersburg returns bringing our\nappointment as commander in chief, and our first foe, Buxhöwden, is\nvanquished; we can now turn our thoughts to the second, Bonaparte. But as\nit turns out, just at that moment a third enemy rises before us—namely the\nOrthodox Russian soldiers, loudly demanding bread, meat, biscuits, fodder,\nand whatnot! The stores are empty, the roads impassable. The Orthodox\nbegin looting, and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no\nidea. Half the regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put\neverything to fire and sword. The inhabitants are totally ruined, the\nhospitals overflow with sick, and famine is everywhere. Twice the\nmarauders even attack our headquarters, and the commander in chief has to\nask for a battalion to disperse them. During one of these attacks they carried\noff my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown. The Emperor proposes\nto give all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I\nmuch fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other.”\nAt first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after a while, in spite\nof himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust Bilíbin), what he\nhad read began to interest him more and more. When he had read thus far,\nhe crumpled the letter up and threw it away. It was not what he had read\nthat vexed him, but the fact that the life out there in which he had now no\npart could perturb him. He shut his eyes, rubbed his forehead as if to rid\nhimself of all interest in what he had read, and listened to what was passing\nin the nursery. Suddenly he thought he heard a strange noise through the\ndoor. He was seized with alarm lest something should have happened to the\nchild while he was reading the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door\nand opened it.\nJust as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him\nwith a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot.\n“My dear,” he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind\nhim.\nAs often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was seized\nby an unreasoning panic—it occurred to him that the child was dead. All\nthat he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror."}, {"page": 520, "text": "“All is over,” he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He\nwent to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find it empty and that the\nnurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the curtain aside and for\nsome time his frightened, restless eyes could not find the baby. At last he\nsaw him: the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with his\nhead lower than the pillow, and was smacking his lips in his sleep and\nbreathing evenly.\nPrince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had already\nlost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had taught him, tried with his\nlips whether the child was still feverish. The soft forehead was moist. Prince\nAndrew touched the head with his hand; even the hair was wet, so profusely\nhad the child perspired. He was not dead, but evidently the crisis was over\nand he was convalescent. Prince Andrew longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to\nhold to his heart, this helpless little creature, but dared not do so. He stood\nover him, gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed\nunder the blanket. He heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared\nunder the curtain of the cot. He did not look round, but still gazing at the\ninfant’s face listened to his regular breathing. The dark shadow was\nPrincess Mary, who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps, lifted the\ncurtain, and dropped it again behind her. Prince Andrew recognized her\nwithout looking and held out his hand to her. She pressed it.\n“He has perspired,” said Prince Andrew.\n“I was coming to tell you so.”\nThe child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead\nagainst the pillow.\nPrince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain her\nluminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that\nwere in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him, slightly\ncatching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a warning gesture and\nstood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing to leave that\nseclusion where they three were shut off from all the world. Prince Andrew\nwas the first to move away, ruffling his hair against the muslin of the\ncurtain.\n“Yes, this is the one thing left me now,” he said with a sigh."}, {"page": 521, "text": "CHAPTER X\nSoon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre went to the\nKiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs, taking with him\nfull directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to what\nhe should do on his estates.\nWhen he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and\nexplained to them his intentions and wishes. He told them that steps would\nbe taken immediately to free his serfs—and that till then they were not to be\noverburdened with labor, women while nursing their babies were not to be\nsent to work, assistance was to be given to the serfs, punishments were to\nbe admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals, asylums, and schools were\nto be established on all the estates. Some of the stewards (there were\nsemiliterate foremen among them) listened with alarm, supposing these\nwords to mean that the young count was displeased with their management\nand embezzlement of money, some after their first fright were amused by\nPierre’s lisp and the new words they had not heard before, others simply\nenjoyed hearing how the master talked, while the cleverest among them,\nincluding the chief steward, understood from this speech how they could\nbest handle the master for their own ends.\nThe chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre’s intentions, but\nremarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the\ngeneral state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.\nDespite Count Bezúkhov’s enormous wealth, since he had come into an\nincome which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year,\nPierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an\nallowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the following\nbudget:\nAbout 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank,\nabout 30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town"}, {"page": 522, "text": "house, and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in\npensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was sent to\nthe countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The building of a new\nchurch, previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the last two\nyears, and he did not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was spent,\nand almost every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the chief\nsteward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests, or of the\nnecessity of rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first task Pierre had\nto face was one for which he had very little aptitude or inclination—\npractical business.\nHe discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. But he felt\nthat this did not forward matters at all. He felt that these consultations were\ndetached from real affairs and did not link up with them or make them\nmove. On the one hand, the chief steward put the state of things to him in\nthe very worst light, pointing out the necessity of paying off the debts and\nundertaking new activities with serf labor, to which Pierre did not agree. On\nthe other hand, Pierre demanded that steps should be taken to liberate the\nserfs, which the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying off the\nloans from the Land Bank, and the consequent impossibility of a speedy\nemancipation.\nThe steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested selling the\nforests in the province of Kostromá, the land lower down the river, and the\nCrimean estate, in order to make it possible: all of which operations\naccording to him were connected with such complicated measures—the\nremoval of injunctions, petitions, permits, and so on—that Pierre became\nquite bewildered and only replied:\n“Yes, yes, do so.”\nPierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him\nto attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried to\npretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The steward for his part\ntried to pretend to the count that he considered these consultations very\nvaluable for the proprietor and troublesome to himself.\nIn Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened to\nmake his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, the\nlargest landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierre’s greatest\nweakness—the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the Lodge"}, {"page": 523, "text": "—were so strong that he could not resist them. Again whole days, weeks,\nand months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied\nwith evening parties, dinners, lunches, and balls, giving him no time for\nreflection, as in Petersburg. Instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he\nstill lived the old life, only in new surroundings.\nOf the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not fulfill\nthe one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral life, and\nthat of the seven virtues he lacked two—morality and the love of death. He\nconsoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another of the precepts—\nthat of reforming the human race—and had other virtues—love of his\nneighbor, and especially generosity.\nIn the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. On the way he\nintended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders had\nbeen carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had entrusted\nto his care and whom he intended to benefit.\nThe chief steward, who considered the young count’s attempts almost\ninsane—unprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the serfs—made some\nconcessions. Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as\nimpracticable, he arranged for the erection of large buildings—schools,\nhospitals, and asylums—on all the estates before the master arrived.\nEverywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes (which\nhe knew Pierre would not like), but for just such gratefully religious ones,\nwith offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality, as, according to\nhis understanding of his master, would touch and delude him.\nThe southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna carriage,\nand the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on Pierre. The\nestates he had not before visited were each more picturesque than the other;\nthe serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grateful for the\nbenefits conferred on them. Everywhere were receptions, which though\nthey embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart.\nIn one place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an icon of\nSaint Peter and Saint Paul, asking permission, as a mark of their gratitude\nfor the benefits he had conferred on them, to build a new chantry to the\nchurch at their own expense in honor of Peter and Paul, his patron saints. In\nanother place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him for\nreleasing them from hard work. On a third estate the priest, bearing a cross,"}, {"page": 524, "text": "came to meet him surrounded by children whom, by the count’s generosity,\nhe was instructing in reading, writing, and religion. On all his estates Pierre\nsaw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection, all\non one plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were soon to be\nopened. Everywhere he saw the stewards’ accounts, according to which the\nserfs’ manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the touching thanks of\ndeputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue coats.\nWhat Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him\nwith bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and Paul\nwas a market village where a fair was held on St. Peter’s day, and that the\nrichest peasants (who formed the deputation) had begun the chantry long\nbefore, but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of\nthe greatest poverty. He did not know that since the nursing mothers were\nno longer sent to work on his land, they did still harder work on their own\nland. He did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed\nthe peasants by his exactions, and that the pupils’ parents wept at having to\nlet him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments. He\ndid not know that the brick buildings, built to plan, were being built by serfs\nwhose manorial labor was thus increased, though lessened on paper. He did\nnot know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the\nserfs’ payments had been diminished by a third, their obligatory manorial\nwork had been increased by a half. And so Pierre was delighted with his\nvisit to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he\nhad left Petersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his “brother-instructor”\nas he called the Grand Master.\n“How easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,” thought\nPierre, “and how little attention we pay to it!”\nHe was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at receiving\nit. This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these\nsimple, kindly people.\nThe chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly\nthrough the naïve and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy,\nseeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre, pressed him\nstill harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all the uselessness of\nfreeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was."}, {"page": 525, "text": "Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult\nto imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would happen to\nthem when they were free, but he insisted, though reluctantly, on what he\nthought right. The steward promised to do all in his power to carry out the\ncount’s wishes, seeing clearly that not only would the count never be able to\nfind out whether all measures had been taken for the sale of the land and\nforests and to release them from the Land Bank, but would probably never\neven inquire and would never know that the newly erected buildings were\nstanding empty and that the serfs continued to give in money and work all\nthat other people’s serfs gave—that is to say, all that could be got out of\nthem."}, {"page": 526, "text": "CHAPTER XI\nReturning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state of\nmind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his friend\nBolkónski, whom he had not seen for two years.\nBoguchárovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields\nand forests of fir and birch, which were partly cut down. The house lay\nbehind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks still\nbare of grass. It was at the end of a village that stretched along the highroad\nin the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir trees.\nThe homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables, a\nbathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular façade still in\ncourse of construction. Round the house was a garden newly laid out. The\nfences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a water cart,\npainted green, stood in a shed; the paths were straight, the bridges were\nstrong and had handrails. Everything bore an impress of tidiness and good\nmanagement. Some domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply to inquiries as to\nwhere the prince lived, pointed out a small newly built lodge close to the\npond. Antón, a man who had looked after Prince Andrew in his boyhood,\nhelped Pierre out of his carriage, said that the prince was at home, and\nshowed him into a clean little anteroom.\nPierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after\nthe brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in Petersburg.\nHe quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered\nwooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone farther, but Antón ran\nahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.\n“Well, what is it?” came a sharp, unpleasant voice.\n“A visitor,” answered Antón.\n“Ask him to wait,” and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed\nback."}, {"page": 527, "text": "Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face\nwith Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking old. Pierre\nembraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek and\nlooked at him closely.\n“Well, I did not expect you, I am very glad,” said Prince Andrew.\nPierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise. He was\nstruck by the change in him. His words were kindly and there was a smile\non his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in spite of his\nevident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and glad sparkle.\nPrince Andrew had grown thinner, paler, and more manly-looking, but what\namazed and estranged Pierre till he got used to it were his inertia and a\nwrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one\nthought.\nAs is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation, it\nwas long before their conversation could settle on anything. They put\nquestions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be talked\nover at length. At last the conversation gradually settled on some of the\ntopics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans for the future, Pierre’s\njourneys and occupations, the war, and so on. The preoccupation and\ndespondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend’s look was now still\nmore clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre,\nespecially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future. It\nwas as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre\nwas saying, but could not. The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to\nspeak of his enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in\nPrince Andrew’s presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic\nviews, which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late\ntour. He checked himself, fearing to seem naïve, yet he felt an irresistible\ndesire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite\ndifferent, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.\n“I can’t tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly know\nmyself again.”\n“Yes, we have altered much, very much, since then,” said Prince Andrew.\n“Well, and you? What are your plans?”\n“Plans!” repeated Prince Andrew ironically. “My plans?” he said, as if\nastonished at the word. “Well, you see, I’m building. I mean to settle here"}, {"page": 528, "text": "altogether next year....”\nPierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew’s face, which\nhad grown much older.\n“No, I meant to ask...” Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted him.\n“But why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels and all\nyou have been doing on your estates.”\nPierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far as\npossible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made.\nPrince Andrew several times prompted Pierre’s story of what he had been\ndoing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened not only\nwithout interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him.\nPierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend’s company and\nat last became silent.\n“I’ll tell you what, my dear fellow,” said Prince Andrew, who evidently\nalso felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, “I am only bivouacking\nhere and have just come to look round. I am going back to my sister today. I\nwill introduce you to her. But of course you know her already,” he said,\nevidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he now found nothing in\ncommon. “We will go after dinner. And would you now like to look round\nmy place?”\nThey went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of the political\nnews and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other\nintimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of\nthe new homestead he was constructing and its buildings, but even here,\nwhile on the scaffolding, in the midst of a talk explaining the future\narrangements of the house, he interrupted himself:\n“However, this is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and then we’ll\nset off.”\nAt dinner, conversation turned on Pierre’s marriage.\n“I was very much surprised when I heard of it,” said Prince Andrew.\nPierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said\nhurriedly: “I will tell you some time how it all happened. But you know it is\nall over, and forever.”\n“Forever?” said Prince Andrew. “Nothing’s forever.”"}, {"page": 529, "text": "“But you know how it all ended, don’t you? You heard of the duel?”\n“And so you had to go through that too!”\n“One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,” said Pierre.\n“Why so?” asked Prince Andrew. “To kill a vicious dog is a very good\nthing really.”\n“No, to kill a man is bad—wrong.”\n“Why is it wrong?” urged Prince Andrew. “It is not given to man to know\nwhat is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will err, and in\nnothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.”\n“What does harm to another is wrong,” said Pierre, feeling with pleasure\nthat for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused, had begun\nto talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to his present state.\n“And who has told you what is bad for another man?” he asked.\n“Bad! Bad!” exclaimed Pierre. “We all know what is bad for ourselves.”\n“Yes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is\nsomething I cannot inflict on others,” said Prince Andrew, growing more\nand more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to\nPierre. He spoke in French. “I only know two very real evils in life: remorse\nand illness. The only good is the absence of those evils. To live for myself\navoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now.”\n“And love of one’s neighbor, and self-sacrifice?” began Pierre. “No, I\ncan’t agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and not to have to\nrepent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for myself and ruined my life.\nAnd only now when I am living, or at least trying” (Pierre’s modesty made\nhim correct himself) “to live for others, only now have I understood all the\nhappiness of life. No, I shall not agree with you, and you do not really\nbelieve what you are saying.” Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with\nan ironic smile.\n“When you see my sister, Princess Mary, you’ll get on with her,” he said.\n“Perhaps you are right for yourself,” he added after a short pause, “but\neveryone lives in his own way. You lived for yourself and say you nearly\nruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for others.\nI experienced just the reverse. I lived for glory.—And after all what is\nglory? The same love of others, a desire to do something for them, a desire"}, {"page": 530, "text": "for their approval.—So I lived for others, and not almost, but quite, ruined\nmy life. And I have become calmer since I began to live only for myself.”\n“But what do you mean by living only for yourself?” asked Pierre,\ngrowing excited. “What about your son, your sister, and your father?”\n“But that’s just the same as myself—they are not others,” explained\nPrince Andrew. “The others, one’s neighbors, le prochain, as you and\nPrincess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and evil. Le prochain\n—your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good.”\nAnd he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He\nevidently wished to draw him on.\n“You are joking,” replied Pierre, growing more and more excited. “What\nerror or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even doing a little\n—though I did very little and did it very badly? What evil can there be in it\nif unfortunate people, our serfs, people like ourselves, were growing up and\ndying with no idea of God and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless\nprayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in future life,\nretribution, recompense, and consolation? What evil and error are there in\nit, if people were dying of disease without help while material assistance\ncould so easily be rendered, and I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital,\nand an asylum for the aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if\na peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give them\nrest and leisure?” said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. “And I have done that\nthough badly and to a small extent; but I have done something toward it and\nyou cannot persuade me that it was not a good action, and more than that,\nyou can’t make me believe that you do not think so yourself. And the main\nthing is,” he continued, “that I know, and know for certain, that the\nenjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happiness in life.”\n“Yes, if you put it like that it’s quite a different matter,” said Prince\nAndrew. “I build a house and lay out a garden, and you build hospitals. The\none and the other may serve as a pastime. But what’s right and what’s good\nmust be judged by one who knows all, but not by us. Well, you want an\nargument,” he added, “come on then.”\nThey rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which\nserved as a veranda.\n“Come, let’s argue then,” said Prince Andrew, “You talk of schools,” he\nwent on, crooking a finger, “education and so forth; that is, you want to"}, {"page": 531, "text": "raise him” (pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap)\n“from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs, while it\nseems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible, and that\nis just what you want to deprive him of. I envy him, but you want to make\nhim what I am, without giving him my means. Then you say, ‘lighten his\ntoil.’ But as I see it, physical labor is as essential to him, as much a\ncondition of his existence, as mental activity is to you or me. You can’t help\nthinking. I go to bed after two in the morning, thoughts come and I can’t\nsleep but toss about till dawn, because I think and can’t help thinking, just\nas he can’t help plowing and mowing; if he didn’t, he would go to the drink\nshop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical labor but\nshould die of it in a week, so he could not stand my physical idleness, but\nwould grow fat and die. The third thing—what else was it you talked\nabout?” and Prince Andrew crooked a third finger. “Ah, yes, hospitals,\nmedicine. He has a fit, he is dying, and you come and bleed him and patch\nhim up. He will drag about as a cripple, a burden to everybody, for another\nten years. It would be far easier and simpler for him to die. Others are being\nborn and there are plenty of them as it is. It would be different if you\ngrudged losing a laborer—that’s how I regard him—but you want to cure\nhim from love of him. And he does not want that. And besides, what a\nnotion that medicine ever cured anyone! Killed them, yes!” said he,\nfrowning angrily and turning away from Pierre.\nPrince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was\nevident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he spoke\nreadily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time. His\nglance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless.\n“Oh, that is dreadful, dreadful!” said Pierre. “I don’t understand how one\ncan live with such ideas. I had such moments myself not long ago, in\nMoscow and when traveling, but at such times I collapsed so that I don’t\nlive at all—everything seems hateful to me... myself most of all. Then I\ndon’t eat, don’t wash... and how is it with you?...”\n“Why not wash? That is not cleanly,” said Prince Andrew; “on the\ncontrary one must try to make one’s life as pleasant as possible. I’m alive,\nthat is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best I can without hurting\nothers.”"}, {"page": 532, "text": "“But with such ideas what motive have you for living?

They could not\nunderstand that I have not the necessary qualifications for it—the kind of\ngood-natured, fussy shallowness necessary for the position. Then there’s\nthis house, which must be built in order to have a nook of one’s own in\nwhich to be quiet. And now there’s this recruiting.”\n“Why aren’t you serving in the army?”\n“After Austerlitz!” said Prince Andrew gloomily. “No, thank you very\nmuch! I have promised myself not to serve again in the active Russian\narmy. And I won’t—not even if Bonaparte were here at Smolénsk\nthreatening Bald Hills—even then I wouldn’t serve in the Russian army!\nWell, as I was saying,” he continued, recovering his composure, “now\nthere’s this recruiting. My father is chief in command of the Third District,\nand my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under him.”\n“Then you are serving?”\n“I am.”\nHe paused a little while.\n“And why do you serve?”\n“Why, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men of\nhis time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too\nenergetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is\nterrible, and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of the\nrecruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had been two hours late a fortnight\nago he would have had a paymaster’s clerk at Yúkhnovna hanged,” said\nPrince Andrew with a smile. “So I am serving because I alone have any\ninfluence with my father, and now and then can save him from actions\nwhich would torment him afterwards.”\n“Well, there you see!”\n“Yes, but it is not as you imagine,” Prince Andrew continued. “I did not,\nand do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen\nsome boots from the recruits; I should even have been very glad to see him\nhanged, but I was sorry for my father—that again is for myself.”"}, {"page": 533, "text": "Prince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered\nfeverishly while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no\ndesire to do good to his neighbor.\n“There now, you wish to liberate your serfs,” he continued; “that is a very\ngood thing, but not for you—I don’t suppose you ever had anyone flogged\nor sent to Siberia—and still less for your serfs. If they are beaten, flogged,\nor sent to Siberia, I don’t suppose they are any the worse off. In Siberia they\nlead the same animal life, and the stripes on their bodies heal, and they are\nhappy as before.

You may\nnot have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those traditions\nof unlimited power, in time when they grow more irritable, become cruel\nand harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot restrain themselves and grow\nmore and more miserable.”\nPrince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking that\nthese thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his father’s case.\nHe did not reply.\n“So that’s what I’m sorry for—human dignity, peace of mind, purity, and\nnot the serfs’ backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave as you may,\nalways remain the same backs and foreheads.”\n“No, no!

Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence now and\nthen with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper.\nPointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in\nhis husbandry.\nPierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and\napparently immersed in his own thoughts.\nHe was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did\nnot see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid, enlighten, and raise\nhim. But as soon as he thought of what he should say, he felt that Prince\nAndrew with one word, one argument, would upset all his teaching, and he\nshrank from beginning, afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what to him\nwas precious and sacred.\n“No, but why do you think so?” Pierre suddenly began, lowering his head\nand looking like a bull about to charge, “why do you think so? You should\nnot think so.”\n“Think? What about?” asked Prince Andrew with surprise.\n“About life, about man’s destiny. It can’t be so. I myself thought like that,\nand do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, don’t smile.\nFreemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought it was:\nFreemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal, aspects of\nhumanity.”\nAnd he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince\nAndrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed from\nthe bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood, and\nlove.\n“Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest is a\ndream,” said Pierre. “Understand, my dear fellow, that outside this union all"}, {"page": 535, "text": "is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you that nothing is left\nfor an intelligent and good man but to live out his life, like you, merely\ntrying not to harm others.

More than once, when the noise of the wheels prevented his\ncatching what Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it, and by the peculiar\nglow that came into Prince Andrew’s eyes and by his silence, Pierre saw\nthat his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would not interrupt\nhim or laugh at what he said.\nThey reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to\ncross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being placed on it, they\nalso stepped on the raft.\nPrince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed silently at the\nflooding waters glittering in the setting sun.\n“Well, what do you think about it?” Pierre asked. “Why are you silent?”\n“What do I think about it? I am listening to you. It’s all very well.... You\nsay: join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life, the destiny\nof man, and the laws which govern the world. But who are we? Men.

You see a\nreign of goodness and truth on earth, but I don’t see it.”\nPierre interrupted him.\n“Do you believe in a future life?” he asked.\n“A future life?” Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no time\nto reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as he knew Prince\nAndrew’s former atheistic convictions.\n“You say you can’t see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor could\nI, and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of\neverything.

I feel that\nbeyond me and above me there are spirits, and that in this world there is\ntruth.”\n“Yes, that is Herder’s theory,” said Prince Andrew, “but it is not that\nwhich can convince me, dear friend—life and death are what convince.\nWhat convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound up with one’s\nown life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right”\n(Prince Andrew’s voice trembled and he turned away), “and suddenly that\nbeing is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to exist.... Why? It cannot be\nthat there is no answer. And I believe there is.... That’s what convinces, that\nis what has convinced me,” said Prince Andrew.\n“Yes, yes, of course,” said Pierre, “isn’t that what I’m saying?”\n“No. All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the necessity\nof a future life, but this: when you go hand in hand with someone and all at\nonce that person vanishes there, into nowhere, and you yourself are left\nfacing that abyss, and look in.

The carriage and horses had long since been\ntaken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The sun had sunk half\nbelow the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near the\nferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment of the footmen,\ncoachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on the raft and talked.\n“If there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and man’s\nhighest happiness consists in striving to attain them.

Two women ran out after them, and all four,\nlooking round at the carriage, ran in dismay up the steps of the back porch.\n“Those are Mary’s ‘God’s folk,’” said Prince Andrew. “They have\nmistaken us for my father. This is the one matter in which she disobeys him.\nHe orders these pilgrims to be driven away, but she receives them.”\n“But what are ‘God’s folk’?” asked Pierre.\nPrince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet\nthem, and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected\nback soon.\nThe old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute.\nPrince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept\nin perfect order and readiness for him in his father’s house; he himself went\nto the nursery.\n“Let us go and see my sister,” he said to Pierre when he returned. “I have\nnot found her yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her ‘God’s folk.’ It will\nserve her right, she will be confused, but you will see her ‘God’s folk.’ It’s\nreally very curious.”\n“What are ‘God’s folk’?” asked Pierre.\n“Come, and you’ll see for yourself.”\nPrincess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face\nwhen they went in.

Je suis très contente de vous voir,” * she said to\nPierre as he kissed her hand.

Ivánushka,\nsipping out of her saucer, looked with sly womanish eyes from under her\nbrows at the young men.\n“Where have you been? To Kiev?” Prince Andrew asked the old woman.\n“I have, good sir,” she answered garrulously. “Just at Christmastime I\nwas deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the\nshrine of the saint. And now I’m from Kolyázin, master, where a great and\nwonderful blessing has been revealed.”\n“And was Ivánushka with you?”\n“I go by myself, benefactor,” said Ivánushka, trying to speak in a bass\nvoice. “I only came across Pelagéya in Yúkhnovo....”\nPelagéya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell what\nshe had seen.\n“In Kolyázin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.”\n“What is it?

The regiment\nwas also a home, and as unalterably dear and precious as his parents’ house.\nWhen he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had\nbeen reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone out\nforaging, when he had again entered into all the little interests of the\nregiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one narrow,\nunchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of moral\nsupport, and the same sense of being at home here in his own place, as he\nhad felt under the parental roof. But here was none of all that turmoil of the\nworld at large, where he did not know his right place and took mistaken\ndecisions; here was no Sónya with whom he ought, or ought not, to have an\nexplanation; here was no possibility of going there or not going there; here\nthere were not twenty-four hours in the day which could be spent in such a\nvariety of ways; there was not that innumerable crowd of people of whom\nnot one was nearer to him or farther from him than another; there were none\nof those uncertain and undefined money relations with his father, and\nnothing to recall that terrible loss to Dólokhov. Here, in the regiment, all\nwas clear and simple. The whole world was divided into two unequal parts:\none, our Pávlograd regiment; the other, all the rest. And the rest was no"}, {"page": 547, "text": "concern of his. In the regiment, everything was definite: who was\nlieutenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad one, and most\nof all, who was a comrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, one’s pay\ncame every four months, there was nothing to think out or decide, you had\nonly to do nothing that was considered bad in the Pávlograd regiment and,\nwhen given an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly, and definitely\nordered—and all would be well.\nHaving once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental\nlife, Rostóv felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to rest.\nLife in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter for him,\nbecause, after his loss to Dólokhov (for which, in spite of all his family’s\nefforts to console him, he could not forgive himself), he had made up his\nmind to atone for his fault by serving, not as he had done before, but really\nwell, and by being a perfectly first-rate comrade and officer—in a word, a\nsplendid man altogether, a thing which seemed so difficult out in the world,\nbut so possible in the regiment.\nAfter his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents in\nfive years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved to take\nonly two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his parents.\nOur army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at Pultúsk and\nPreussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting the\nEmperor’s arrival and the beginning of a new campaign.\nThe Pávlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had\nserved in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in Russia,\nand arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the campaign. It had\nbeen neither at Pultúsk nor at Preussisch-Eylau and, when it joined the army\nin the field in the second half of the campaign, was attached to Plátov’s\ndivision.\nPlátov’s division was acting independently of the main army. Several\ntimes parts of the Pávlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy,\nhad taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal Oudinot’s\ncarriages. In April the Pávlograds were stationed immovably for some\nweeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village.\nA thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river broke, and\nthe roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the men nor\nfodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could arrive, the"}, {"page": 548, "text": "men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages, searching for\npotatoes, but found few even of these.\nEverything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled—if any\nremained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken\nfrom them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead of taking\nanything from them, often gave them the last of their rations.\nThe Pávlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, but\nhad lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the hospitals,\ndeath was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or the swelling that\ncame from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and hardly able to drag\ntheir legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals. When spring came\non, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the ground that looked\nlike asparagus, which, for some reason, they called “Máshka’s sweet root.”\nIt was very bitter, but they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it\nout with their sabers and ate it, though they were ordered not to do so, as it\nwas a noxious plant. That spring a new disease broke out among the\nsoldiers, a swelling of the arms, legs, and face, which the doctors attributed\nto eating this root. But in spite of all this, the soldiers of Denísov’s squadron\nfed chiefly on “Máshka’s sweet root,” because it was the second week that\nthe last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a\nman and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.\nThe horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched\nroofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered with tufts of felty\nwinter hair.\nDespite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on living just as\nusual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms, the hussars\nformed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed their horses, polished\ntheir arms, brought in straw from the thatched roofs in place of fodder, and\nsat down to dine round the caldrons from which they rose up hungry, joking\nabout their nasty food and their hunger. As usual, in their spare time, they lit\nbonfires, steamed themselves before them naked; smoked, picked out and\nbaked sprouting rotten potatoes, told and listened to stories of Potëmkin’s\nand Suvórov’s campaigns, or to legends of Alësha the Sly, or the priest’s\nlaborer Mikólka.\nThe officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless, half-ruined\nhouses.

The younger ones occupied themselves as before, some\nplaying cards (there was plenty of money, though there was no food), some\nwith more innocent games, such as quoits and skittles. The general trend of\nthe campaign was rarely spoken of, partly because nothing certain was\nknown about it, partly because there was a vague feeling that in the main it\nwas going badly.\nRostóv lived, as before, with Denísov, and since their furlough they had\nbecome more friendly than ever. Denísov never spoke of Rostóv’s family,\nbut by the tender friendship his commander showed him, Rostóv felt that\nthe elder hussar’s luckless love for Natásha played a part in strengthening\ntheir friendship. Denísov evidently tried to expose Rostóv to danger as\nseldom as possible, and after an action greeted his safe return with evident\njoy. On one of his foraging expeditions, in a deserted and ruined village to\nwhich he had come in search of provisions, Rostóv found a family\nconsisting of an old Pole and his daughter with an infant in arms. They were\nhalf clad, hungry, too weak to get away on foot and had no means of\nobtaining a conveyance. Rostóv brought them to his quarters, placed them\nin his own lodging, and kept them for some weeks while the old man was\nrecovering. One of his comrades, talking of women, began chaffing Rostóv,\nsaying that he was more wily than any of them and that it would not be a\nbad thing if he introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had saved.\nRostóv took the joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasant things\nto the officer that it was all Denísov could do to prevent a duel. When the\nofficer had gone away, Denísov, who did not himself know what Rostóv’s\nrelations with the Polish girl might be, began to upbraid him for his\nquickness of temper, and Rostóv replied:\n“Say what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I can’t tell you how it\noffended me... because... well, for that reason....”\nDenísov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room\nwithout looking at Rostóv, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.\n“Ah, what a mad bweed you Wostóvs are!” he muttered, and Rostóv\nnoticed tears in his eyes."}, {"page": 550, "text": "CHAPTER XVI\nIn April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor’s arrival, but\nRostóv had no chance of being present at the review he held at Bartenstein,\nas the Pávlograds were at the outposts far beyond that place.\nThey were bivouacking. Denísov and Rostóv were living in an earth hut,\ndug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf. The hut\nwas made in the following manner, which had then come into vogue. A\ntrench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight inches deep, and\neight feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were cut out and these\nformed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself was the room, in which\nthe lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board, lying on\npiles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On each side of\nthe trench, the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet,\nand this did duty for bedsteads and couches. The roof was so constructed\nthat one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on\nthe beds if one drew close to the table. Denísov, who was living luxuriously\nbecause the soldiers of his squadron liked him, had also a board in the roof\nat the farther end, with a piece of (broken but mended) glass in it for a\nwindow. When it was very cold, embers from the soldiers’ campfire were\nplaced on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the “reception room”—as\nDenísov called that part of the hut—and it was then so warm that the\nofficers, of whom there were always some with Denísov and Rostóv, sat in\ntheir shirt sleeves.\nIn April, Rostóv was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and\neight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed his rain-\nsoaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm, then tidied up\nthe things on the table and in his own corner, and, his face glowing from\nexposure to the wind and with nothing on but his shirt, lay down on his\nback, putting his arms under his head. He was pleasantly considering the\nprobability of being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering"}, {"page": 551, "text": "expedition, and was awaiting Denísov, who had gone out somewhere and\nwith whom he wanted a talk.\nSuddenly he heard Denísov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut,\nevidently much excited. Rostóv moved to the window to see whom he was\nspeaking to, and saw the quartermaster, Topchéenko.\n“I ordered you not to let them eat that Máshka woot stuff!” Denísov was\nshouting. “And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchúk bwought some\nfwom the fields.”\n“I have given the order again and again, your honor, but they don’t obey,”\nanswered the quartermaster.\nRostóv lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: “Let him\nfuss and bustle now, my job’s done and I’m lying down—capitally!” He\ncould hear that Lavrúshka—that sly, bold orderly of Denísov’s—was\ntalking, as well as the quartermaster. Lavrúshka was saying something\nabout loaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen he had seen when he had gone out\nfor provisions.\nThen Denísov’s voice was heard shouting farther and farther away.\n“Saddle! Second platoon!”\n“Where are they off to now?” thought Rostóv.\nFive minutes later, Denísov came into the hut, climbed with muddy boots\non the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things about, took his leaded\nwhip, buckled on his saber, and went out again. In answer to Rostóv’s\ninquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly that he had\nsome business.\n“Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!” said Denísov\ngoing out, and Rostóv heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through\nthe mud. He did not even trouble to find out where Denísov had gone.\nHaving got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till\ntoward evening. Denísov had not yet returned. The weather had cleared up,\nand near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing sváyka,\nlaughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft\nmud. Rostóv joined them. In the middle of the game, the officers saw some\nwagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind\nthem. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a\ncrowd of hussars surrounded them."}, {"page": 552, "text": "“There now, Denísov has been worrying,” said Rostóv, “and here are the\nprovisions.”\n“So they are!” said the officers. “Won’t the soldiers be glad!”\nA little behind the hussars came Denísov, accompanied by two infantry\nofficers with whom he was talking.\nRostóv went to meet them.\n“I warn you, Captain,” one of the officers, a short thin man, evidently\nvery angry, was saying.\n“Haven’t I told you I won’t give them up?” replied Denísov.\n“You will answer for it, Captain. It is mutiny—seizing the transport of\none’s own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two days.”\n“And mine have had nothing for two weeks,” said Denísov.\n“It is robbery! You’ll answer for it, sir!” said the infantry officer, raising\nhis voice.\n“Now, what are you pestewing me for?” cried Denísov, suddenly losing\nhis temper. “I shall answer for it and not you, and you’d better not buzz\nabout here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!” he shouted at the officers.\n“Very well, then!” shouted the little officer, undaunted and not riding\naway. “If you are determined to rob, I’ll...”\n“Go to the devil! quick ma’ch, while you’re safe and sound!” and\nDenísov turned his horse on the officer.\n“Very well, very well!” muttered the officer, threateningly, and turning\nhis horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.\n“A dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!” shouted Denísov\nafter him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a\nmounted infantryman) and riding up to Rostóv, he burst out laughing.\n“I’ve taken twansports from the infantwy by force!” he said. “After all,\ncan’t let our men starve.”\nThe wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an\ninfantry regiment, but learning from Lavrúshka that the transport was\nunescorted, Denísov with his hussars had seized it by force. The soldiers\nhad biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared them with the\nother squadrons."}, {"page": 553, "text": "The next day the regimental commander sent for Denísov, and holding\nhis fingers spread out before his eyes said:\n“This is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and won’t begin\nproceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff and settle the business\nthere in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such\nand such stores received. If not, as the demand was booked against an\ninfantry regiment, there will be a row and the affair may end badly.”\nFrom the regimental commander’s, Denísov rode straight to the staff with\na sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he came back to his\ndugout in a state such as Rostóv had never yet seen him in. Denísov could\nnot speak and gasped for breath. When Rostóv asked what was the matter,\nhe only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse, feeble voice.\nAlarmed at Denísov’s condition, Rostóv suggested that he should\nundress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.\n“Twy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but\nI’ll always thwash scoundwels... and I’ll tell the Empewo’...

I enter, and at the table... who do\nyou think? No, but wait a bit!...

So it’s you who’s starving us to death! Is it? Take this\nand this!’ and I hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... ‘Ah, what a... what\na...!’ and I sta’ted fwashing him...

Calm yourself,” said Rostóv. “You’ve\nset your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up again.”\nDenísov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke calm\nand cheerful.\nBut at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostóv’s and\nDenísov’s dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed\nthem a paper addressed to Major Denísov from the regimental commander\nin which inquiries were made about yesterday’s occurrence. The adjutant\ntold them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn: that a court-\nmartial had been appointed, and that in view of the severity with which\nmarauding and insubordination were now regarded, degradation to the\nranks would be the best that could be hoped for.\nThe case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, after seizing\nthe transports, Major Denísov, being drunk, went to the chief quartermaster\nand without any provocation called him a thief, threatened to strike him,\nand on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a\nthrashing, and dislocated the arm of one of them.\nIn answer to Rostóv’s renewed questions, Denísov said, laughing, that he\nthought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it, but\nthat it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not in the least fear any kind\nof trial, and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an\nanswer that they would not easily forget.\nDenísov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but Rostóv knew\nhim too well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) at heart he\nfeared a court-martial and was worried over the affair, which was evidently\ntaking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices from the court\narrived, and on the first of May, Denísov was ordered to hand the squadron\nover to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division to\nexplain his violence at the commissariat office. On the previous day Plátov\nreconnoitered with two Cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars.\nDenísov, as was his wont, rode out in front of the outposts, parading his\ncourage.

Rostóv, who felt\nhis friend’s absence very much, having no news of him since he left and\nfeeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs, took\nadvantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Denísov in hospital.\nThe hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated\nby Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when it is so\nbeautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a particularly dismal\nappearance with its broken roofs and fences, its foul streets, tattered\ninhabitants, and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about.\nThe hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and\npanes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence\nthat had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged soldiers, with pale swollen\nfaces, were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard.\nDirectly Rostóv entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of\nputrefaction and hospital air.

The foul air, to which he had already\nbegun to get used in the corridor, was still stronger here. It was a little\ndifferent, more pungent, and one felt that this was where it originated.\nIn the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows,\nthe sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls, and\nleaving a passage in the middle.

He had not at all expected\nsuch a sight. Just before him, almost across the middle of the passage on the\nbare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge by the cut of his\nhair. The man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs outstretched. His face\nwas purple, his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen, and\non his bare legs and arms which were still red, the veins stood out like\ncords. He was knocking the back of his head against the floor, hoarsely\nuttering some word which he kept repeating. Rostóv listened and made out\nthe word. It was “drink, drink, a drink!” Rostóv glanced round, looking for\nsomeone who would put this man back in his place and bring him water.\n“Who looks after the sick here?” he asked the assistant.\nJust then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came in from the next\nroom, marching stiffly, and drew up in front of Rostóv.\n“Good day, your honor!” he shouted, rolling his eyes at Rostóv and\nevidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities."}, {"page": 559, "text": "“Get him to his place and give him some water,” said Rostóv, pointing to\nthe Cossack.\n“Yes, your honor,” the soldier replied complacently, and rolling his eyes\nmore than ever he drew himself up still straighter, but did not move.\n“No, it’s impossible to do anything here,” thought Rostóv, lowering his\neyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an intense look fixed on\nhim on his right, and he turned. Close to the corner, on an overcoat, sat an\nold, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier as thin as a skeleton, with a stern\nsallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rostóv. The man’s neighbor on one\nside whispered something to him, pointing at Rostóv, who noticed that the\nold man wanted to speak to him.

The\nfirst person Rostóv met in the officers’ ward was a thin little man with one\narm, who was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital\ndressing gown, with a pipe between his teeth.

My neighbor,”\nhe added, when he heard who Rostóv wanted. “Here, here,” and Túshin led\nhim into the next room, from whence came sounds of several laughing\nvoices.\n“How can they laugh, or even live at all here?” thought Rostóv, still\naware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the\nsoldiers’ ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious looks\nwhich had followed him out from both sides, and the face of that young\nsoldier with eyes rolled back.\nDenísov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket, though it\nwas nearly noon.\n“Ah, Wostóv? How are you, how are you?” he called out, still in the same\nvoice as in the regiment, but Rostóv noticed sadly that under this habitual\nease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling showed itself in the\nexpression of Denísov’s face and the intonations of his voice.\nHis wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed even now, six weeks\nafter he had been hit. His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces of"}, {"page": 561, "text": "the other hospital patients, but it was not this that struck Rostóv. What\nstruck him was that Denísov did not seem glad to see him, and smiled at\nhim unnaturally. He did not ask about the regiment, nor about the general\nstate of affairs, and when Rostóv spoke of these matters did not listen.\nRostóv even noticed that Denísov did not like to be reminded of the\nregiment, or in general of that other free life which was going on outside the\nhospital. He seemed to try to forget that old life and was only interested in\nthe affair with the commissariat officers. On Rostóv’s inquiry as to how the\nmatter stood, he at once produced from under his pillow a paper he had\nreceived from the commission and the rough draft of his answer to it. He\nbecame animated when he began reading his paper and specially drew\nRostóv’s attention to the stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies. His\nhospital companions, who had gathered round Rostóv—a fresh arrival from\nthe world outside—gradually began to disperse as soon as Denísov began\nreading his answer. Rostóv noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen\nhad already heard that story more than once and were tired of it. Only the\nman who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed,\ngloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and little one-armed Túshin still\nlistened, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the reading, the\nUhlan interrupted Denísov.\n“But what I say is,” he said, turning to Rostóv, “it would be best simply\nto petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards will now be\ndistributed, and surely a pardon would be granted....”\n“Me petition the Empewo’!” exclaimed Denísov, in a voice to which he\ntried hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like an\nexpression of irritable impotence. “What for? If I were a wobber I would\nask mercy, but I’m being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers to book.\nLet them twy me, I’m not afwaid of anyone. I’ve served the Tsar and my\ncountwy honowably and have not stolen! And am I to be degwaded?...\nListen, I’m w’iting to them stwaight. This is what I say: ‘If I had wobbed\nthe Tweasuwy...’”\n“It’s certainly well written,” said Túshin, “but that’s not the point, Vasíli\nDmítrich,” and he also turned to Rostóv. “One has to submit, and Vasíli\nDmítrich doesn’t want to. You know the auditor told you it was a bad\nbusiness.”\n“Well, let it be bad,” said Denísov."}, {"page": 562, "text": "“The auditor wrote out a petition for you,” continued Túshin, “and you\nought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt he” (indicating\nRostóv) “has connections on the staff. You won’t find a better opportunity.”\n“Haven’t I said I’m not going to gwovel?” Denísov interrupted him, went\non reading his paper.\nRostóv had not the courage to persuade Denísov, though he instinctively\nfelt that the way advised by Túshin and the other officers was the safest,\nand though he would have been glad to be of service to Denísov. He knew\nhis stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper.\nWhen the reading of Denísov’s virulent reply, which took more than an\nhour, was over, Rostóv said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day in a\nmost dejected state of mind amid Denísov’s hospital comrades, who had\ngathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to their\nstories. Denísov was moodily silent all the evening.\nLate in the evening, when Rostóv was about to leave, he asked Denísov\nwhether he had no commission for him.\n“Yes, wait a bit,” said Denísov, glancing round at the officers, and taking\nhis papers from under his pillow he went to the window, where he had an\ninkpot, and sat down to write.\n“It seems it’s no use knocking one’s head against a wall!” he said,\ncoming from the window and giving Rostóv a large envelope. In it was the\npetition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in which Denísov, without\nalluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials, simply asked for\npardon.\n“Hand it in. It seems...”\nHe did not finish, but gave a painfully unnatural smile."}, {"page": 563, "text": "CHAPTER XIX\nHaving returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of\nDenísov’s affairs, Rostóv rode to Tilsit with the letter to the Emperor.\nOn the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in\nTilsit. Borís Drubetskóy had asked the important personage on whom he\nwas in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at Tilsit.\n“I should like to see the great man,” he said, alluding to Napoleon, whom\nhitherto he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.\n“You are speaking of Buonaparte?” asked the general, smiling.\nBorís looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was\nbeing tested.\n“I am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,” he replied. The\ngeneral patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.\n“You will go far,” he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.\nBorís was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two\nEmperors met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napoleon\npass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river, saw the\npensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the\nbank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleon’s arrival, saw both Emperors get\ninto boats, and saw how Napoleon—reaching the raft first—stepped quickly\nforward to meet Alexander and held out his hand to him, and how they both\nretired into the pavilion. Since he had begun to move in the highest circles\nBorís had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him\nand to note it down. At the time of the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names\nof those who had come with Napoleon and about the uniforms they wore,\nand listened attentively to words spoken by important personages. At the\nmoment the Emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch, and\ndid not forget to look at it again when Alexander came out. The interview\nhad lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes. He noted this down that same"}, {"page": 564, "text": "evening, among other facts he felt to be of historic importance. As the\nEmperor’s suite was a very small one, it was a matter of great importance,\nfor a man who valued his success in the service, to be at Tilsit on the\noccasion of this interview between the two Emperors, and having succeeded\nin this, Borís felt that henceforth his position was fully assured. He had not\nonly become known, but people had grown accustomed to him and\naccepted him. Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself,\nso that the latter knew his face, and all those at court, far from cold-\nshouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer, would\nnow have been surprised had he been absent.\nBorís lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count Zhilínski. Zhilínski,\na Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately fond of the French,\nand almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, French officers of the Guard and\nfrom French headquarters were dining and lunching with him and Borís.\nOn the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhilínski arranged a\nsupper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of\nNapoleon’s, there were also several French officers of the Guard, and a\npage of Napoleon’s, a young lad of an old aristocratic French family. That\nsame day, Rostóv, profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in\ncivilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by Borís and\nZhilínski.\nRostóv, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far\nfrom having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the\nFrench—who from being foes had suddenly become friends—that had\ntaken place at headquarters and in Borís. In the army, Bonaparte and the\nFrench were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, contempt, and\nfear. Only recently, talking with one of Plátov’s Cossack officers, Rostóv\nhad argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as\na sovereign, but as a criminal. Quite lately, happening to meet a wounded\nFrench colonel on the road, Rostóv had maintained with heat that peace was\nimpossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte.\nRostóv was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of French officers\nin Borís’ lodging, dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from\nquite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank. As soon as he\nnoticed a French officer, who thrust his head out of the door, that warlike\nfeeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy"}, {"page": 565, "text": "suddenly seized him. He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian\nwhether Drubetskóy lived there. Borís, hearing a strange voice in the\nanteroom, came out to meet him. An expression of annoyance showed itself\nfor a moment on his face on first recognizing Rostóv.\n“Ah, it’s you? Very glad, very glad to see you,” he said, however, coming\ntoward him with a smile. But Rostóv had noticed his first impulse.\n“I’ve come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, but I have\nbusiness,” he said coldly.\n“No, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment.\nDans un moment je suis à vous,” * he said, answering someone who called\nhim.\n* “In a minute I shall be at your disposal.”\n“I see I’m intruding,” Rostóv repeated.\nThe look of annoyance had already disappeared from Borís’ face: having\nevidently reflected and decided how to act, he very quietly took both\nRostóv’s hands and led him into the next room. His eyes, looking serenely\nand steadily at Rostóv, seemed to be veiled by something, as if screened by\nblue spectacles of conventionality. So it seemed to Rostóv.\n“Oh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!” said Borís, and\nhe led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced\nhim to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian, but an hussar\nofficer, and an old friend of his.\n“Count Zhilínski—le Comte N. N.—le Capitaine S. S.,” said he, naming\nhis guests. Rostóv looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed reluctantly,\nand remained silent.\nZhilínski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very\nwillingly into his circle and did not speak to Rostóv. Borís did not appear to\nnotice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the same pleasant\ncomposure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he had met\nRostóv, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the Frenchmen, with the\npoliteness characteristic of his countrymen, addressed the obstinately\ntaciturn Rostóv, saying that the latter had probably come to Tilsit to see the\nEmperor.\n“No, I came on business,” replied Rostóv, briefly."}, {"page": 566, "text": "Rostóv had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of\ndissatisfaction on Borís’ face, and as always happens to those in a bad\nhumor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that\nhe was in everybody’s way. He really was in their way, for he alone took no\npart in the conversation which again became general. The looks the visitors\ncast on him seemed to say: “And what is he sitting here for?” He rose and\nwent up to Borís.\n“Anyhow, I’m in your way,” he said in a low tone. “Come and talk over\nmy business and I’ll go away.”\n“Oh, no, not at all,” said Borís. “But if you are tired, come and lie down\nin my room and have a rest.”\n“Yes, really...”\nThey went into the little room where Borís slept. Rostóv, without sitting\ndown, began at once, irritably (as if Borís were to blame in some way)\ntelling him about Denísov’s affair, asking him whether, through his general,\nhe could and would intercede with the Emperor on Denísov’s behalf and get\nDenísov’s petition handed in. When he and Borís were alone, Rostóv felt\nfor the first time that he could not look Borís in the face without a sense of\nawkwardness. Borís, with one leg crossed over the other and stroking his\nleft hand with the slender fingers of his right, listened to Rostóv as a general\nlistens to the report of a subordinate, now looking aside and now gazing\nstraight into Rostóv’s eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this\nhappened Rostóv felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes.\n“I have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe in\nsuch affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the Emperor, but\nto apply to the commander of the corps.... But in general, I think...”\n“So you don’t want to do anything? Well then, say so!” Rostóv almost\nshouted, not looking Borís in the face.\nBorís smiled.\n“On the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought...”\nAt that moment Zhilínski’s voice was heard calling Borís.\n“Well then, go, go, go...” said Rostóv, and refusing supper and remaining\nalone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long time, hearing the\nlighthearted French conversation from the next room."}, {"page": 567, "text": "CHAPTER XX\nRostóv had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on\nDenísov’s behalf. He could not himself go to the general in attendance as he\nwas in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission to do so, and Borís,\neven had he wished to, could not have done so on the following day. On\nthat day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were signed. The Emperors\nexchanged decorations: Alexander received the Cross of the Legion of\nHonor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the First Degree, and a\ndinner had been arranged for the evening, given by a battalion of the French\nGuards to the Preobrazhénsk battalion. The Emperors were to be present at\nthat banquet.\nRostóv felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Borís that, when the\nlatter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and early next\nmorning went away, avoiding Borís. In his civilian clothes and a round hat,\nhe wandered about the town, staring at the French and their uniforms and at\nthe streets and houses where the Russian and French Emperors were\nstaying. In a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for\nthe dinner; he saw the Russian and French colors draped from side to side\nof the streets, with huge monograms A and N. In the windows of the houses\nalso flags and bunting were displayed.\n“Borís doesn’t want to help me and I don’t want to ask him. That’s\nsettled,” thought Nicholas. “All is over between us, but I won’t leave here\nwithout having done all I can for Denísov and certainly not without getting\nhis letter to the Emperor. The Emperor!... He is here!” thought Rostóv, who\nhad unconsciously returned to the house where Alexander lodged.\nSaddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were\nassembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.\n“I may see him at any moment,” thought Rostóv. “If only I were to hand\nthe letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really arrest me for my"}, {"page": 568, "text": "civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand on whose side justice\nlies. He understands everything, knows everything. Who can be more just,\nmore magnanimous than he? And even if they did arrest me for being here,\nwhat would it matter?” thought he, looking at an officer who was entering\nthe house the Emperor occupied. “After all, people do go in.... It’s all\nnonsense! I’ll go in and hand the letter to the Emperor myself so much the\nworse for Drubetskóy who drives me to it!” And suddenly with a\ndetermination he himself did not expect, Rostóv felt for the letter in his\npocket and went straight to the house.\n“No, I won’t miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz,” he\nthought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious of\nthe blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. “I will fall at his feet and\nbeseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even thank me. ‘I am\nhappy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is the greatest\nhappiness,’” Rostóv fancied the sovereign saying. And passing people who\nlooked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch of the Emperor’s\nhouse.\nA broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right he saw a\nclosed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading to the lower\nfloor.\n“Whom do you want?” someone inquired.\n“To hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty,” said Nicholas, with a\ntremor in his voice.\n“A petition? This way, to the officer on duty” (he was shown the door\nleading downstairs), “only it won’t be accepted.”\nOn hearing this indifferent voice, Rostóv grew frightened at what he was\ndoing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so\nfascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away, but\nthe official who had questioned him opened the door, and Rostóv entered.\nA short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots and a\nbatiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing in that room,\nand his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of\nhandsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some reason, attracted Rostóv’s\nattention. This man was speaking to someone in the adjoining room."}, {"page": 569, "text": "“A good figure and in her first bloom,” he was saying, but on seeing\nRostóv, he stopped short and frowned.\n“What is it? A petition?”\n“What is it?” asked the person in the other room.\n“Another petitioner,” answered the man with the braces.\n“Tell him to come later. He’ll be coming out directly, we must go.”\n“Later... later! Tomorrow. It’s too late...”\nRostóv turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces stopped\nhim.\n“Whom have you come from? Who are you?”\n“I come from Major Denísov,” answered Rostóv.\n“Are you an officer?”\n“Lieutenant Count Rostóv.”\n“What audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with\nyou... go,” and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him.\nRostóv went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were\nmany officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to pass.\nCursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of finding himself at\nany moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to shame and\narrested in his presence, fully alive now to the impropriety of his conduct\nand repenting of it, Rostóv, with downcast eyes, was making his way out of\nthe house through the brilliant suite when a familiar voice called him and a\nhand detained him.\n“What are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?” asked a deep voice.\nIt was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor’s special favor\nduring this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the division in\nwhich Rostóv was serving.\nRostóv, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the kindly, jocular\nface of the general, he took him aside and in an excited voice told him the\nwhole affair, asking him to intercede for Denísov, whom the general knew.\nHaving heard Rostóv to the end, the general shook his head gravely.\n“I’m sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter.”"}, {"page": 570, "text": "Hardly had Rostóv handed him the letter and finished explaining\nDenísov’s case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on\nthe stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the porch. The gentlemen of\nthe Emperor’s suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses. Hayne, the\nsame groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the Emperor’s horse, and\nthe faint creak of a footstep Rostóv knew at once was heard on the stairs.\nForgetting the danger of being recognized, Rostóv went close to the porch,\ntogether with some inquisitive civilians, and again, after two years, saw\nthose features he adored: that same face and same look and step, and the\nsame union of majesty and mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm and\nlove for his sovereign rose again in Rostóv’s soul in all its old force. In the\nuniform of the Preobrazhénsk regiment—white chamois-leather breeches\nand high boots—and wearing a star Rostóv did not know (it was that of the\nLégion d’honneur), the monarch came out into the porch, putting on his\ngloves and carrying his hat under his arm. He stopped and looked about\nhim, brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a few words to\nsome of the generals, and, recognizing the former commander of Rostóv’s\ndivision, smiled and beckoned to him.\nAll the suite drew back and Rostóv saw the general talking for some time\nto the Emperor.\nThe Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse.\nAgain the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers (among whom\nwas Rostóv) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside his horse, with\nhis hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the cavalry general and said\nin a loud voice, evidently wishing to be heard by all:\n“I cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is stronger than I,” and\nhe raised his foot to the stirrup.\nThe general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted and\nrode down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm, Rostóv\nran after him with the crowd."}, {"page": 571, "text": "CHAPTER XXI\nThe Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a battalion of\nthe Preobrazhénsk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the French\nGuards in their bearskin caps on the left.\nAs the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which presented arms,\nanother group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and at the\nhead of them Rostóv recognized Napoleon. It could be no one else. He\ncame at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over a white\nvest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder. He was riding a very fine\nthoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered\nsaddlecloth. On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did so,\nRostóv, with his cavalryman’s eye, could not help noticing that Napoleon\ndid not sit well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions shouted “Hurrah!”\nand “Vive l’Empereur!” Napoleon said something to Alexander, and both\nEmperors dismounted and took each other’s hands. Napoleon’s face wore\nan unpleasant and artificial smile. Alexander was saying something affable\nto him.\nIn spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes’ horses, which were\npushing back the crowd, Rostóv kept his eyes on every movement of\nAlexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander treated\nBonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the Tsar, as\nif such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter to him.\nAlexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites, approached\nthe right flank of the Preobrazhénsk battalion and came straight up to the\ncrowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the\nEmperors that Rostóv, standing in the front row, was afraid he might be\nrecognized.\n“Sire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the bravest\nof your soldiers,” said a sharp, precise voice, articulating every letter."}, {"page": 572, "text": "This was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight into\nAlexander’s eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to him\nand, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.\n“To him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,” added\nNapoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance\nexasperating to Rostóv, he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn up\nbefore him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their Emperor.\n“Will Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?” said Alexander and\ntook a few hasty steps toward Prince Kozlóvski, the commander of the\nbattalion.\nBonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand,\ntore it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind him rushed\nforward and picked it up.\n“To whom shall it be given?” the Emperor Alexander asked Kozlóvski, in\nRussian in a low voice.\n“To whomever Your Majesty commands.”\nThe Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing back,\nremarked:\n“But we must give him an answer.”\nKozlóvski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rostóv in his\nscrutiny.\n“Can it be me?” thought Rostóv.\n“Lázarev!” the colonel called, with a frown, and Lázarev, the first soldier\nin the rank, stepped briskly forward.\n“Where are you off to? Stop here!” voices whispered to Lázarev who did\nnot know where to go. Lázarev stopped, casting a sidelong look at his\ncolonel in alarm. His face twitched, as often happens to soldiers called\nbefore the ranks.\nNapoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out\nbehind him as if to take something. The members of his suite, guessing at\nonce what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed\nsomething from one to another, and a page—the same one Rostóv had seen\nthe previous evening at Borís’—ran forward and, bowing respectfully over\nthe outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment, laid in it an"}, {"page": 573, "text": "Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, without looking, pressed two fingers\ntogether and the badge was between them. Then he approached Lázarev\n(who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch), looked\nround at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was\ndone for the sake of his ally, and the small white hand holding the Order\ntouched one of Lázarev’s buttons. It was as if Napoleon knew that it was\nonly necessary for his hand to deign to touch that soldier’s breast for the\nsoldier to be forever happy, rewarded, and distinguished from everyone else\nin the world. Napoleon merely laid the cross on Lázarev’s breast and,\ndropping his hand, turned toward Alexander as though sure that the cross\nwould adhere there. And it really did.\nOfficious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the cross and\nfastened it to the uniform. Lázarev glanced morosely at the little man with\nwhite hands who was doing something to him and, still standing motionless\npresenting arms, looked again straight into Alexander’s eyes, as if asking\nwhether he should stand there, or go away, or do something else. But\nreceiving no orders, he remained for some time in that rigid position.\nThe Emperors remounted and rode away. The Preobrazhénsk battalion,\nbreaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables\nprepared for them.\nLázarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers embraced\nhim, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of officers and\ncivilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of Russian and French\nvoices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square. Two officers\nwith flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, passed by Rostóv.\n“What d’you think of the treat? All on silver plate,” one of them was\nsaying. “Have you seen Lázarev?”\n“I have.”\n“Tomorrow, I hear, the Preobrazhénskis will give them a dinner.”\n“Yes, but what luck for Lázarev! Twelve hundred francs’ pension for\nlife.”\n“Here’s a cap, lads!” shouted a Preobrazhénsk soldier, donning a shaggy\nFrench cap.\n“It’s a fine thing! First-rate!”"}, {"page": 574, "text": "“Have you heard the password?” asked one Guards’ officer of another.\n“The day before yesterday it was ‘Napoléon, France, bravoure’; yesterday,\n‘Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.’ One day our Emperor gives it and next day\nNapoleon.

He must respond in kind.”\nBorís, too, with his friend Zhilínski, came to see the Preobrazhénsk\nbanquet. On his way back, he noticed Rostóv standing by the corner of a\nhouse.\n“Rostóv! How d’you do? We missed one another,” he said, and could not\nrefrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and troubled\nwas Rostóv’s face.\n“Nothing, nothing,” replied Rostóv.\n“You’ll call round?”\n“Yes, I will.”\nRostóv stood at that corner for a long time, watching the feast from a\ndistance. In his mind, a painful process was going on which he could not\nbring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose in his soul. Now he remembered\nDenísov with his changed expression, his submission, and the whole\nhospital, with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease. So vividly did\nhe recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round to see\nwhere the smell came from. Next he thought of that self-satisfied\nBonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an Emperor, liked and\nrespected by Alexander. Then why those severed arms and legs and those\ndead men?... Then again he thought of Lázarev rewarded and Denísov\npunished and unpardoned. He caught himself harboring such strange\nthoughts that he was frightened.\nThe smell of the food the Preobrazhénskis were eating and a sense of\nhunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to eat\nbefore going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning. There\nhe found so many people, among them officers who, like himself, had come\nin civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in getting a dinner. Two officers of\nhis own division joined him. The conversation naturally turned on the\npeace. The officers, his comrades, like most of the army, were dissatisfied\nwith the peace concluded after the battle of Friedland.

The\nprocess in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion.\nHe feared to give way to his thoughts, yet could not get rid of them.\nSuddenly, on one of the officers’ saying that it was humiliating to look at\nthe French, Rostóv began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore\nmuch to the surprise of the officers:\n“How can you judge what’s best?” he cried, the blood suddenly rushing\nto his face. “How can you judge the Emperor’s actions? What right have we\nto argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperor’s aims or his actions!”\n“But I never said a word about the Emperor!” said the officer, justifying\nhimself, and unable to understand Rostóv’s outburst, except on the\nsupposition that he was drunk.\nBut Rostóv did not listen to him.\n“We are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,” he\nwent on. “If we are ordered to die, we must die. If we’re punished, it means\nthat we have deserved it, it’s not for us to judge. If the Emperor pleases to\nrecognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance with him, it\nmeans that that is the right thing to do. If once we begin judging and\narguing about everything, nothing sacred will be left! That way we shall be\nsaying there is no God—nothing!” shouted Nicholas, banging the table—\nvery little to the point as it seemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to\nthe course of his own thoughts.\n“Our business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That’s all....”\nsaid he.\n“And to drink,” said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.\n“Yes, and to drink,” assented Nicholas. “Hullo there!

In the forest it was almost hot, no wind could be\nfelt. The birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless, and lilac-\ncolored flowers and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and\nlifting last year’s leaves.

How early! The birches and cherry and alders too are coming\nout.... But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah, here is one oak!”\nAt the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times the age of the\nbirches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and twice as tall as\nthey. It was an enormous tree, its girth twice as great as a man could\nembrace, and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken off\nand its bark scarred. With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling\nunsymmetrically, and its gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an aged, stern,\nand scornful monster among the smiling birch trees. Only the dead-looking\nevergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak, refused to yield to the\ncharm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine.\n“Spring, love, happiness!” this oak seemed to say. “Are you not weary of\nthat stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud?

He heard merry girlish cries behind some\ntrees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross the path of his\ncalèche. Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a dark-haired, remarkably\nslim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress, with a white handkerchief on her\nhead from under which loose locks of hair escaped. The girl was shouting\nsomething but, seeing that he was a stranger, ran back laughing without\nlooking at him.\nSuddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang. The day was so beautiful,\nthe sun so bright, everything around so gay, but that slim pretty girl did not\nknow, or wish to know, of his existence and was contented and cheerful in\nher own separate—probably foolish—but bright and happy life. “What is\nshe so glad about? What is she thinking of? Not of the military regulations\nor of the arrangement of the Ryazán serfs’ quitrents. Of what is she\nthinking? Why is she so happy?” Prince Andrew asked himself with\ninstinctive curiosity.\nIn 1809 Count Ilyá Rostóv was living at Otrádnoe just as he had done in\nformer years, that is, entertaining almost the whole province with hunts,\ntheatricals, dinners, and music.

Why is she so glad?”\nThat night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable to sleep. He\nread awhile and then put out his candle, but relit it. It was hot in the room,\nthe inside shutters of which were closed. He was cross with the stupid old\nman (as he called Rostóv), who had made him stay by assuring him that\nsome necessary documents had not yet arrived from town, and he was\nvexed with himself for having stayed.\nHe got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened the\nshutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst into\nthe room. He opened the casement. The night was fresh, bright, and very\nstill. Just before the window was a row of pollard trees, looking black on\none side and with a silvery light on the other. Beneath the trees grew some\nkind of lush, wet, bushy vegetation with silver-lit leaves and stems here and\nthere. Farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew, to the\nright was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches, and above it\nshone the moon, nearly at its full, in a pale, almost starless, spring sky.\nPrince Andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested\non that sky.\nHis room was on the first floor.

In the forest the harness bells sounded\nyet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all was\nthick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not\njar on the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood around, were\ndelicately green with fluffy young shoots.\nThe whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only\na small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the road and\nthe sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was dark in the shade, the right\nside glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the\nbreeze. Everything was in blossom, the nightingales trilled, and their voices\nreverberated now near, now far away.\n“Yes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed,” thought\nPrince Andrew. “But where is it?” he again wondered, gazing at the left side\nof the road, and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the\nvery oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured, spreading out a canopy\nof sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of\nthe evening sun. Neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and\nsorrows were any of them in evidence now. Through the hard century-old\nbark, even where there were no twigs, leaves had sprouted such as one\ncould hardly believe the old veteran could have produced.\n“Yes, it is the same oak,” thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he was\nseized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal.

A whole series of\nsensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go\nto Petersburg, and even to re-enter the service, kept springing up in his\nmind. He could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted\nthe necessity of taking an active share in life, just as a month before he had\nnot understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter\nhis head. It now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be\nsenselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again\nplayed an active part in life. He did not even remember how formerly, on\nthe strength of similar wretched logical arguments, it had seemed obvious\nthat he would be degrading himself if he now, after the lessons he had had\nin life, allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in\nthe possibility of happiness or love. Now reason suggested quite the\nopposite. After that journey to Ryazán he found the country dull; his former\npursuits no longer interested him, and often when sitting alone in his study\nhe got up, went to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own face. Then\nhe would turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise, who with hair curled à\nla grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame. She did\nnot now say those former terrible words to him, but looked simply, merrily,\nand inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing his arms behind him,\nlong paced the room, now frowning, now smiling, as he reflected on those\nirrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as a crime, which altered his whole\nlife and were connected with Pierre, with fame, with the girl at the window,\nthe oak, and woman’s beauty and love.

That is what follows\nfrom the fact that it is cold; and not that a child who needs fresh air should\nremain at home,” he would add with extreme logic, as if punishing someone\nfor those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him.\nAt such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work dries\nmen up."}, {"page": 588, "text": "CHAPTER IV\nPrince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August, 1809. It was the time\nwhen the youthful Speránski was at the zenith of his fame and his reforms\nwere being pushed forward with the greatest energy. That same August the\nEmperor was thrown from his calèche, injured his leg, and remained three\nweeks at Peterhof, receiving Speránski every day and no one else. At that\ntime the two famous decrees were being prepared that so agitated society—\nabolishing court ranks and introducing examinations to qualify for the\ngrades of Collegiate Assessor and State Councilor—and not merely these\nbut a whole state constitution, intended to change the existing order of\ngovernment in Russia: legal, administrative, and financial, from the Council\nof State down to the district tribunals. Now those vague liberal dreams with\nwhich the Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne, and which he had\ntried to put into effect with the aid of his associates, Czartorýski,\nNovosíltsev, Kochubéy, and Strógonov—whom he himself in jest had\ncalled his Comité de salut public—were taking shape and being realized.\nNow all these men were replaced by Speránski on the civil side, and\nArakchéev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew, as a\ngentleman of the chamber, presented himself at court and at a levee. The\nEmperor, though he met him twice, did not favor him with a single word. It\nhad always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic to the\nEmperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality generally, and\nin the cold, repellent glance the Emperor gave him, he now found further\nconfirmation of this surmise. The courtiers explained the Emperor’s neglect\nof him by His Majesty’s displeasure at Bolkónski’s not having served since\n1805.\n“I know myself that one cannot help one’s sympathies and antipathies,”\nthought Prince Andrew, “so it will not do to present my proposal for the\nreform of the army regulations to the Emperor personally, but the project\nwill speak for itself.”"}, {"page": 589, "text": "He mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal, a friend of his\nfather’s. The field marshal made an appointment to see him, received him\ngraciously, and promised to inform the Emperor. A few days later Prince\nAndrew received notice that he was to go to see the Minister of War, Count\nArakchéev.\nOn the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakchéev’s waiting\nroom at nine in the morning.\nHe did not know Arakchéev personally, had never seen him, and all he\nhad heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man.\n“He is Minister of War, a man trusted by the Emperor, and I need not\nconcern myself about his personal qualities: he has been commissioned to\nconsider my project, so he alone can get it adopted,” thought Prince Andrew\nas he waited among a number of important and unimportant people in\nCount Arakchéev’s waiting room.\nDuring his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen the\nanterooms of many important men, and the different types of such rooms\nwere well known to him. Count Arakchéev’s anteroom had quite a special\ncharacter. The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an\naudience showed embarrassment and servility; the faces of those of higher\nrank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness, covered by a mask of\nunconcern and ridicule of themselves, their situation, and the person for\nwhom they were waiting. Some walked thoughtfully up and down, others\nwhispered and laughed. Prince Andrew heard the nickname “Síla\nAndréevich” and the words, “Uncle will give it to us hot,” in reference to\nCount Arakchéev. One general (an important personage), evidently feeling\noffended at having to wait so long, sat crossing and uncrossing his legs and\nsmiling contemptuously to himself.\nBut the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all faces\n—that of fear. Prince Andrew for the second time asked the adjutant on duty\nto take in his name, but received an ironical look and was told that his turn\nwould come in due course. After some others had been shown in and out of\nthe minister’s room by the adjutant on duty, an officer who struck Prince\nAndrew by his humiliated and frightened air was admitted at that terrible\ndoor.

There are many laws but no one to\ncarry out the old ones. Nowadays everybody designs laws, it is easier\nwriting than doing.”\n“I came at His Majesty the Emperor’s wish to learn from your excellency\nhow you propose to deal with the memorandum I have presented,” said\nPrince Andrew politely.\n“I have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the\ncommittee.

In Petersburg he now\nexperienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle, when\ntroubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling circles\nwhere the future, on which the fate of millions depended, was being shaped.\nFrom the irritation of the older men, the curiosity of the uninitiated, the\nreserve of the initiated, the hurry and preoccupation of everyone, and the\ninnumerable committees and commissions of whose existence he learned\nevery day, he felt that now, in 1809, here in Petersburg a vast civil conflict\nwas in preparation, the commander in chief of which was a mysterious\nperson he did not know, but who was supposed to be a man of genius—\nSperánski. And this movement of reconstruction of which Prince Andrew\nhad a vague idea, and Speránski its chief promoter, began to interest him so\nkeenly that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a\nsecondary place in his consciousness.\nPrince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the\nhighest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The reforming party\ncordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place because he was\nreputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly because by liberating\nhis serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal. The party of the\nold and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations, turned to him expecting\nhis sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms, simply because he was the\nson of his father. The feminine society world welcomed him gladly, because\nhe was rich, distinguished, a good match, and almost a newcomer, with a\nhalo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his\nwife.

Speránski’s whole figure was of a peculiar\ntype that made him easily recognizable. In the society in which Prince\nAndrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward and\nclumsy gestures possessed such calmness and self-assurance; he had never\nseen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half-closed, rather\nhumid eyes, or so firm a smile that expressed nothing; nor had he heard\nsuch a refined, smooth, soft voice; above all he had never seen such delicate\nwhiteness of face or hands—hands which were broad, but very plump, soft,\nand white. Such whiteness and softness Prince Andrew had only seen on the\nfaces of soldiers who had been long in hospital. This was Speránski,\nSecretary of State, reporter to the Emperor and his companion at Erfurt,\nwhere he had more than once met and talked with Napoleon.\nSperánski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people\ninvoluntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to speak.\nHe spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be listened to, and he looked\nonly at the person with whom he was conversing.\nPrince Andrew followed Speránski’s every word and movement with\nparticular attention. As happens to some people, especially to men who\njudge those near to them severely, he always on meeting anyone new—\nespecially anyone whom, like Speránski, he knew by reputation—expected\nto discover in him the perfection of human qualities.\nSperánski told Kochubéy he was sorry he had been unable to come\nsooner as he had been detained at the palace. He did not say that the\nEmperor had kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation of\nmodesty. When Kochubéy introduced Prince Andrew, Speránski slowly\nturned his eyes to Bolkónski with his customary smile and looked at him in\nsilence.\n“I am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard of you, as\neveryone has,” he said after a pause.\nKochubéy said a few words about the reception Arakchéev had given\nBolkónski. Speránski smiled more markedly.\n“The chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend\nMonsieur Magnítski,” he said, fully articulating every word and syllable,"}, {"page": 595, "text": "“and if you like I can put you in touch with him.” He paused at the full stop.\n“I hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to co-operate in promoting\nall that is reasonable.”\nA circle soon formed round Speránski, and the old man who had talked\nabout his subordinate Pryánichnikov addressed a question to him.\nPrince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every\nmovement of Speránski’s: this man, not long since an insignificant divinity\nstudent, who now, Bolkónski thought, held in his hands—those plump\nwhite hands—the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the\nextraordinarily disdainful composure with which Speránski answered the\nold man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from an\nimmeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud, Speránski\nsmiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of\nwhat pleased the sovereign.\nHaving talked for a little while in the general circle, Speránski rose and\ncoming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the room. It\nwas clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in Bolkónski.\n“I had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated\nconversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,” he said with\na mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he and\nPrince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he\nhad just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. “I have known of you\nfor a long time: first from your action with regard to your serfs, a first\nexample, of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators;\nand secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who\nhave not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the\nranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so much gossip and tittle-\ntattle.”\n“No,” said Prince Andrew, “my father did not wish me to take advantage\nof the privilege. I began the service from the lower grade.”\n“Your father, a man of the last century, evidently stands above our\ncontemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely re-establishes\nnatural justice.”\n“I think, however, that these condemnations have some ground,” returned\nPrince Andrew, trying to resist Speránski’s influence, of which he began to\nbe conscious. He did not like to agree with him in everything and felt a"}, {"page": 596, "text": "wish to contradict. Though he usually spoke easily and well, he felt a\ndifficulty in expressing himself now while talking with Speránski. He was\ntoo much absorbed in observing the famous man’s personality.\n“Grounds of personal ambition maybe,” Speránski put in quietly.\n“And of state interest to some extent,” said Prince Andrew.\n“What do you mean?” asked Speránski quietly, lowering his eyes.\n“I am an admirer of Montesquieu,” replied Prince Andrew, “and his idea\nthat le principe des monarchies est l’honneur me paraît incontestable.\nCertains droits et privilèges de la noblesse me paraissent être des moyens\nde soutenir ce sentiment.” *\n* “The principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable. Certain\nrights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that\nsentiment.”\nThe smile vanished from Speránski’s white face, which was much\nimproved by the change. Probably Prince Andrew’s thought interested him.\n“Si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue,” * he began,\npronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking even slower than\nin Russian but quite calmly.\n* “If you regard the question from that point of view.”\nSperánski went on to say that honor, l’honneur, cannot be upheld by\nprivileges harmful to the service; that honor, l’honneur, is either a negative\nconcept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of emulation in\npursuit of commendation and rewards, which recognize it. His arguments\nwere concise, simple, and clear.\n“An institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, is one similar\nto the Légion d’honneur of the great Emperor Napoleon, not harmful but\nhelpful to the success of the service, but not a class or court privilege.”\n“I do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court privileges have\nattained the same end,” returned Prince Andrew. “Every courtier considers\nhimself bound to maintain his position worthily.”\n“Yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince,” said\nSperánski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an\nargument which was embarrassing for his companion. “If you will do me\nthe honor of calling on me on Wednesday,” he added, “I will, after talking"}, {"page": 597, "text": "with Magnítski, let you know what may interest you, and shall also have the\npleasure of a more detailed chat with you.”\nClosing his eyes, he bowed à la française, without taking leave, and\ntrying to attract as little attention as possible, he left the room."}, {"page": 598, "text": "CHAPTER VI\nDuring the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the\nwhole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite\novershadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city.\nOn returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook\nfour or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours. The\nmechanism of life, the arrangement of the day so as to be in time\neverywhere, absorbed the greater part of his vital energy. He did nothing,\ndid not even think or find time to think, but only talked, and talked\nsuccessfully, of what he had thought while in the country.\nHe sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same\nremark on the same day in different circles. But he was so busy for whole\ndays together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing.\nAs he had done on their first meeting at Kochubéy’s, Speránski produced\na strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, when he received\nhim tête-à-tête at his own house and talked to him long and confidentially.\nTo Bolkónski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant\ncreatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that\nperfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that in Speránski\nhe had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous man. Had\nSperánski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed the same\nbreeding and traditions, Bolkónski would soon have discovered his weak,\nhuman, unheroic sides; but as it was, Speránski’s strange and logical turn of\nmind inspired him with respect all the more because he did not quite\nunderstand him. Moreover, Speránski, either because he appreciated the\nother’s capacity or because he considered it necessary to win him to his\nside, showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness before Prince\nAndrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which goes hand in hand\nwith self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption that one’s companion"}, {"page": 599, "text": "is the only man besides oneself capable of understanding the folly of the\nrest of mankind and the reasonableness and profundity of one’s own ideas.\nDuring their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Speránski more\nthan once remarked: “We regard everything that is above the common level\nof rooted custom...” or, with a smile: “But we want the wolves to be fed and\nthe sheep to be safe...” or: “They cannot understand this...” and all in a way\nthat seemed to say: “We, you and I, understand what they are and who we\nare.”\nThis first long conversation with Speránski only strengthened in Prince\nAndrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting.\nHe saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by his\nenergy and persistence had attained power, which he was using solely for\nthe welfare of Russia. In Prince Andrew’s eyes Speránski was the man he\nwould himself have wished to be—one who explained all the facts of life\nreasonably, considered important only what was rational, and was capable\nof applying the standard of reason to everything. Everything seemed so\nsimple and clear in Speránski’s exposition that Prince Andrew involuntarily\nagreed with him about everything. If he replied and argued, it was only\nbecause he wished to maintain his independence and not submit to\nSperánski’s opinions entirely. Everything was right and everything was as it\nshould be: only one thing disconcerted Prince Andrew. This was\nSperánski’s cold, mirrorlike look, which did not allow one to penetrate to\nhis soul, and his delicate white hands, which Prince Andrew involuntarily\nwatched as one does watch the hands of those who possess power. This\nmirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritated Prince Andrew, he knew\nnot why. He was unpleasantly struck, too, by the excessive contempt for\nothers that he observed in Speránski, and by the diversity of lines of\nargument he used to support his opinions. He made use of every kind of\nmental device, except analogy, and passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince\nAndrew, from one to another. Now he would take up the position of a\npractical man and condemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and laugh\nironically at his opponents; now grow severely logical, or suddenly rise to\nthe realm of metaphysics. (This last resource was one he very frequently\nemployed.) He would transfer a question to metaphysical heights, pass on to\ndefinitions of space, time, and thought, and, having deduced the refutation\nhe needed, would again descend to the level of the original discussion."}, {"page": 600, "text": "In general the trait of Speránski’s mentality which struck Prince Andrew\nmost was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority of\nreason. It was evident that the thought could never occur to him which to\nPrince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is after all impossible to\nexpress all one thinks; and that he had never felt the doubt, “Is not all I\nthink and believe nonsense?” And it was just this peculiarity of Speránski’s\nmind that particularly attracted Prince Andrew.\nDuring the first period of their acquaintance Bolkónski felt a passionate\nadmiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for Bonaparte. The\nfact that Speránski was the son of a village priest, and that stupid people\nmight meanly despise him on account of his humble origin (as in fact many\ndid), caused Prince Andrew to cherish his sentiment for him the more, and\nunconsciously to strengthen it.\nOn that first evening Bolkónski spent with him, having mentioned the\nCommission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, Speránski told him\nsarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and fifty years,\nhad cost millions, and had done nothing except that Rosenkampf had stuck\nlabels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes.\n“And that is all the state has for the millions it has spent,” said he. “We\nwant to give the Senate new juridical powers, but we have no laws. That is\nwhy it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to serve in these times!”\nPrince Andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was\nneeded which he did not possess.\n“But nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious circle\nfrom which we must break a way out.”\nA week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army\nRegulations and—what he had not at all expected—was chairman of a\nsection of the committee for the revision of the laws. At Speránski’s request\nhe took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up and, with\nthe aid of the Code Napoléon and the Institutes of Justinian, he worked at\nformulating the section on Personal Rights."}, {"page": 601, "text": "CHAPTER VII\nNearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to Petersburg\nafter visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading\nposition among the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and funeral\nlodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various\nlodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection of\ntemples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms, in\nregard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular. He\nsupported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in\nPetersburg.\nHis life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations and\ndissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he considered it\nimmoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the bachelor\ncircles in which he moved.\nAmid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre at the\nend of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest upon it, the\nmore Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him. At the same\ntime he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the closer bound he\ninvoluntarily became to the order. When he had joined the Freemasons he\nhad experienced the feeling of one who confidently steps onto the smooth\nsurface of a bog. When he put his foot down it sank in. To make quite sure\nof the firmness of the ground, he put his other foot down and sank deeper\nstill, became stuck in it, and involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog.\nJoseph Alexéevich was not in Petersburg—he had of late stood aside\nfrom the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost entirely in\nMoscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew in ordinary\nlife, and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as Brothers in\nFreemasonry and not as Prince B. or Iván Vasílevich D., whom he knew in\nsociety mostly as weak and insignificant men. Under the Masonic aprons\nand insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in"}, {"page": 602, "text": "ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and reckoning up twenty to thirty\nrubles received for the most part in promises from a dozen members, of\nwhom half were as well able to pay as himself, Pierre remembered the\nMasonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote all his belongings\nto his neighbor, and doubts on which he tried not to dwell arose in his soul.\nHe divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the first he put\nthose who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges or in human\naffairs, but were exclusively occupied with the mystical science of the\norder: with questions of the threefold designation of God, the three\nprimordial elements—sulphur, mercury, and salt—or the meaning of the\nsquare and all the various figures of the temple of Solomon. Pierre\nrespected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged,\nincluding, Pierre thought, Joseph Alexéevich himself, but he did not share\ntheir interests. His heart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry.\nIn the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him,\nseeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight\nand comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.\nIn the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw\nnothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized\nthe strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport\nor significance. Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master of the\nprincipal lodge.\nFinally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged,\nparticularly those who had lately joined. These according to Pierre’s\nobservations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for\nanything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy\nyoung Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank, and\nof whom there were very many in the lodge.\nPierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry, at\nany rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely on\nexternals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but suspected\nthat Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original\nprinciples. And so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated\ninto the higher secrets of the order.\nIn the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg.

The Petersburg Freemasons all came to see him, tried to ingratiate\nthemselves with him, and it seemed to them all that he was preparing\nsomething for them and concealing it.\nA solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened, at\nwhich Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers what he\nhad to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order. The meeting\nwas a full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began his\naddress.\n“Dear Brothers,” he began, blushing and stammering, with a written\nspeech in his hand, “it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in the\nseclusion of our lodge—we must act—act! We are drowsing, but we must\nact.” Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.\n“For the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of virtue,”\nhe read, “we must cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse principles in\nharmony with the spirit of the times, undertake the education of the young,\nunite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the wisest men, boldly yet\nprudently overcome superstitions, infidelity, and folly, and form of those\ndevoted to us a body linked together by unity of purpose and possessed of\nauthority and power.\n“To attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice\nand must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this world,\nreceive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great endeavors we are\ngravely hampered by the political institutions of today. What is to be done\nin these circumstances? To favor revolutions, overthrow everything, repel\nforce by force?... No! We are very far from that. Every violent reform\ndeserves censure, for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what\nthey are, and also because wisdom needs no violence.\n“The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing\nmen of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of conviction—aiming\nat the punishment of vice and folly, and patronizing talent and virtue:\nraising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our Brotherhood.\nOnly then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands of\nthe protectors of disorder and to control them without their being aware of"}, {"page": 604, "text": "it. In a word, we must found a form of government holding universal sway,\nwhich should be diffused over the whole world without destroying the\nbonds of citizenship, and beside which all other governments can continue\nin their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great\naim of our order, which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice. This\naim was that of Christianity itself. It taught men to be wise and good and\nfor their own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and\nwisest men.\n“At that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching alone\nwas of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her with special\nstrength, but now we need much more powerful methods. It is now\nnecessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in virtue a charm\npalpable to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate the passions; but we\nmust strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it is therefore necessary that\neveryone should be able to satisfy his passions within the limits of virtue.\nOur order should provide means to that end.\n“As soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state, each\nof them again training two others and all being closely united, everything\nwill be possible for our order, which has already in secret accomplished\nmuch for the welfare of mankind.”\nThis speech not only made a strong impression, but created excitement in\nthe lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it dangerous designs of\nIlluminism, * met it with a coldness that surprised Pierre. The Grand Master\nbegan answering him, and Pierre began developing his views with more and\nmore warmth. It was long since there had been so stormy a meeting. Parties\nwere formed, some accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others supporting him. At\nthat meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of men’s\nminds, which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself identically to two\npersons. Even those members who seemed to be on his side understood him\nin their own way with limitations and alterations he could not agree to, as\nwhat he always wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he\nhimself understood it.\n* The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical institutions.\nAt the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will\nreproved Bezúkhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue"}, {"page": 605, "text": "alone, but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute.

For three\ndays after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at home\nreceiving no one and going nowhere.\nIt was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who implored him\nto see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and how she wished\nto devote her whole life to him.\nAt the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would\nreturn to Petersburg from abroad.\nFollowing this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre respected\nless than the others forced his way in to see him and, turning the\nconversation upon Pierre’s matrimonial affairs, by way of fraternal advice\nexpressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong and that he\nwas neglecting one of the first rules of Freemasonry by not forgiving the\npenitent.\nAt the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vasíli’s wife, sent to him\nimploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most\nimportant matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and\nthat they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then was,\nthis was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him. Nothing in\nlife seemed to him of much importance, and under the influence of the\ndepression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his\nresolution to punish his wife.\n“No one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to blame,” he\nthought.\nIf he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it was\nonly because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step.\nHad his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away.

This is what he noted in his diary:\nMoscow, 17th November\nI have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I\nhave experienced. Joseph Alexéevich is living poorly and has for three\nyears been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has ever\nheard him utter a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till late at\nnight, except when he eats his very plain food, he is working at science. He\nreceived me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay. I\nmade the sign of the Knights of the East and of Jerusalem, and he\nresponded in the same manner, asking me with a mild smile what I had\nlearned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges. I told him\neverything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed to our\nPetersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of my rupture\nwith the Brothers. Joseph Alexéevich, having remained silent and\nthoughtful for a good while, told me his view of the matter, which at once\nlit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow. He\nsurprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of the\norder: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery. (2) The purification\nand reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The improvement of the\nhuman race by striving for such purification. Which is the principal aim of\nthese three? Certainly self-reformation and self-purification. Only to this\naim can we always strive independently of circumstances. But at the same\ntime just this aim demands the greatest efforts of us; and so, led astray by\npride, losing sight of this aim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery\nwhich in our impurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation\nof the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and\nprofligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is attracted by\nsocial activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground Joseph Alexéevich\ncondemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the depth of my soul I\nagreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he said to me, “the chief duty\nof a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in perfecting himself. We often\nthink that by removing all the difficulties of our life we shall more quickly"}, {"page": 608, "text": "reach our aim, but on the contrary, my dear sir, it is only in the midst of\nworldly cares that we can attain our three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledge—\nfor man can only know himself by comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which\ncan only be attained by conflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief virtue\n—love of death. Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and\ndevelop our innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life.” These words\nare all the more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical\nsufferings, Joseph Alexéevich is never weary of life though he loves death,\nfor which—in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man—he does\nnot yet feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained to\nme fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out to me\nthat the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He advised me\nnot to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but to take up only\nsecond-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while diverting the Brothers from\npride, to turn them toward the true path self-knowledge and self-perfecting.\nBesides this he advised me for myself personally above all to keep a watch\nover myself, and to that end he gave me a notebook, the one I am now\nwriting in and in which I will in future note down all my actions.\nPetersburg, 23rd November\nI am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears\nand said that Hélène was here and that she implored me to hear her; that she\nwas innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I knew that if I\nonce let myself see her I should not have strength to go on refusing what\nshe wanted. In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and advice to seek.\nHad my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do. I went to\nmy room and reread Joseph Alexéevich’s letters and recalled my\nconversations with him, and deduced from it all that I ought not to refuse a\nsupplicant, and ought to reach a helping hand to everyone—especially to\none so closely bound to me—and that I must bear my cross. But if I forgive\nher for the sake of doing right, then let union with her have only a spiritual\naim. That is what I decided, and what I wrote to Joseph Alexéevich. I told\nmy wife that I begged her to forget the past, to forgive me whatever wrong I\nmay have done her, and that I had nothing to forgive. It gave me joy to tell\nher this. She need not know how hard it was for me to see her again.

The largest of these was the French circle of the Napoleonic\nalliance, the circle of Count Rumyántsev and Caulaincourt. In this group\nHélène, as soon as she had settled in Petersburg with her husband, took a\nvery prominent place. She was visited by the members of the French\nembassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for their intellect\nand polished manners.\nHélène had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the Emperors\nand had brought from there these connections with the Napoleonic\nnotabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant. Napoleon himself had\nnoticed her in the theater and said of her: “C’est un superbe animal.” * Her\nsuccess as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise Pierre, for she\nhad become even handsomer than before. What did surprise him was that\nduring these last two years his wife had succeeded in gaining the reputation\n“d’ une femme charmante, aussi spirituelle que belle.” *(2) The\ndistinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her eight-page letters. Bilíbin saved up\nhis epigrams to produce them in Countess Bezúkhova’s presence. To be\nreceived in the Countess Bezúkhova’s salon was regarded as a diploma of\nintellect. Young men read books before attending Hélène’s evenings, to\nhave something to say in her salon, and secretaries of the embassy, and even\nambassadors, confided diplomatic secrets to her, so that in a way Hélène\nwas a power. Pierre, who knew she was very stupid, sometimes attended,\nwith a strange feeling of perplexity and fear, her evenings and dinner\nparties, where politics, poetry, and philosophy were discussed. At these\nparties his feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his\ntrick to be found out at any moment.

He was\nthat absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband who was in no one’s\nway, and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the\ndrawing room, he served, by the contrast he presented to her, as an\nadvantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife. Pierre during the\nlast two years, as a result of his continual absorption in abstract interests\nand his sincere contempt for all else, had acquired in his wife’s circle,\nwhich did not interest him, that air of unconcern, indifference, and\nbenevolence toward all, which cannot be acquired artificially and therefore\ninspires involuntary respect. He entered his wife’s drawing room as one\nenters a theater, was acquainted with everybody, equally pleased to see\neveryone, and equally indifferent to them all. Sometimes he joined in a\nconversation which interested him and, regardless of whether any\n“gentlemen of the embassy” were present or not, lispingly expressed his\nviews, which were sometimes not at all in accord with the accepted tone of\nthe moment. But the general opinion concerning the queer husband of “the\nmost distinguished woman in Petersburg” was so well established that no\none took his freaks seriously.\nAmong the many young men who frequented her house every day, Borís\nDrubetskóy, who had already achieved great success in the service, was the\nmost intimate friend of the Bezúkhov household since Hélène’s return from\nErfurt. Hélène spoke of him as “mon page” and treated him like a child.\nHer smile for him was the same as for everybody, but sometimes that smile\nmade Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him Borís behaved with a particularly\ndignified and sad deference. This shade of deference also disturbed Pierre.\nHe had suffered so painfully three years before from the mortification to\nwhich his wife had subjected him that he now protected himself from the\ndanger of its repetition, first by not being a husband to his wife, and\nsecondly by not allowing himself to suspect."}, {"page": 611, "text": "“No, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced\nher former infatuations,” he told himself. “There has never been an instance\nof a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the heart”—a statement\nwhich, though gathered from an unknown source, he believed implicitly.\nYet strange to say Borís’ presence in his wife’s drawing room (and he was\nalmost always there) had a physical effect upon Pierre; it constricted his\nlimbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom of his movements.\n“What a strange antipathy,” thought Pierre, “yet I used to like him very\nmuch.”\nIn the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather blind\nand absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who did nothing\nbut harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured fellow. But a\ncomplex and difficult process of internal development was taking place all\nthis time in Pierre’s soul, revealing much to him and causing him many\nspiritual doubts and joys."}, {"page": 612, "text": "CHAPTER X\nPierre went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it during that\ntime:\n24th November\nGot up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties.

On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God, help\nand strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the Scriptures, but\nwithout proper feeling.

It was\nBorís Drubetskóy who was admitted. I nominated him and was the Rhetor.\nA strange feeling agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the dark\nchamber. I caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which I\nvainly tried to overcome. That is why I should really like to save him from\nevil and lead him into the path of truth, but evil thoughts of him did not\nleave me. It seemed to me that his object in entering the Brotherhood was\nmerely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge. Apart from\nthe fact that he had asked me several times whether N. and S. were\nmembers of our lodge (a question to which I could not reply) and that\naccording to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for our holy\norder and is too preoccupied and satisfied with the outer man to desire\nspiritual improvement, I had no cause to doubt him, but he seemed to me\ninsincere, and all the time I stood alone with him in the dark temple it\nseemed to me that he was smiling contemptuously at my words, and I\nwished really to stab his bare breast with the sword I held to it.

Afterwards went and\npaced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but instead my\nimagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago, when Dólokhov,\nmeeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I was enjoying perfect\npeace of mind in spite of my wife’s absence. At the time I gave him no\nanswer. Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in my mind gave\nhim the most malevolent and bitter replies. I recollected myself and drove\naway that thought only when I found myself glowing with anger, but I did\nnot sufficiently repent. Afterwards Borís Drubetskóy came and began\nrelating various adventures. His coming vexed me from the first, and I said\nsomething disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared up and said much that\nwas unpleasant and even rude to him. He became silent, and I recollected\nmyself only when it was too late. My God, I cannot get on with him at all.\nThe cause of this is my egotism. I set myself above him and so become\nmuch worse than he, for he is lenient to my rudeness while I on the contrary\nnourish contempt for him. O God, grant that in his presence I may rather\nsee my own vileness, and behave so that he too may benefit. After dinner I\nfell asleep and as I was drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my\nleft ear, “Thy day!”\nI dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by\ndogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left\nthigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it with my\nhands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger one, began biting\nme. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the bigger and heavier it grew.\nAnd suddenly Brother A. came and, taking my arm, led me to a building to\nenter which we had to pass along a narrow plank. I stepped on it, but it bent\nand gave way and I began to clamber up a fence which I could scarcely\nreach with my hands. After much effort I dragged myself up, so that my leg"}, {"page": 615, "text": "hung down on one side and my body on the other.

It seemed as if I chattered\nincessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could not\nplease him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace him. But as\nsoon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young, and\nhe was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order, but so\nsoftly that I could not hear it. Then it seemed that we all left the room and\nsomething strange happened. We were sitting or lying on the floor. He was\ntelling me something, and I wished to show him my sensibility, and not\nlistening to what he was saying I began picturing to myself the condition of\nmy inner man and the grace of God sanctifying me. And tears came into my\neyes, and I was glad he noticed this. But he looked at me with vexation and\njumped up, breaking off his remarks. I felt abashed and asked whether what\nhe had been saying did not concern me; but he did not reply, gave me a kind\nlook, and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a\ndouble bed. He lay down on the edge of it and I burned with longing to\ncaress him and lie down too. And he said, “Tell me frankly what is your\nchief temptation? Do you know it? I think you know it already.” Abashed\nby this question, I replied that sloth was my chief temptation. He shook his\nhead incredulously; and even more abashed, I said that though I was living\nwith my wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her husband. To\nthis he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one’s embraces and\ngave me to understand that that was my duty. But I replied that I should be\nashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I awoke and\nfound in my mind the text from the Gospel: “The life was the light of men.\nAnd the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.”"}, {"page": 616, "text": "Joseph Alexéevich’s face had looked young and bright.

I seemed to know at once that the process\nof regeneration had already taken place in him, and I rushed to meet him. I\nembraced him and kissed his hands, and he said, “Hast thou noticed that my\nface is different?” I looked at him, still holding him in my arms, and saw\nthat his face was young, but that he had no hair on his head and his features\nwere quite changed. And I said, “I should have known you had I met you by\nchance,” and I thought to myself, “Am I telling the truth?” And suddenly I\nsaw him lying like a dead body; then he gradually recovered and went with\nme into my study carrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper; I said,\n“I drew that,” and he answered by bowing his head. I opened the book, and\non all the pages there were excellent drawings. And in my dream I knew\nthat these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its\nbeloved. And on its pages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in\ntransparent garments and with a transparent body, flying up to the clouds.\nAnd I seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a\nrepresentation of the Song of Songs.

The only resource\nobviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official post,\nso he had come to Petersburg to look for one and also, as he said, to let the\nlassies enjoy themselves for the last time.\nSoon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to Véra and was\naccepted.\nThough in Moscow the Rostóvs belonged to the best society without\nthemselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of\nacquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were\nprovincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without\ninquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them.\nThe Rostóvs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in\nMoscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country\nneighbors from Otrádnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters,\nPerónskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bezúkhov, and the son of their district\npostmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the men who\nvery soon became frequent visitors at the Rostóvs’ house in Petersburg were\nBorís, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with\nhim, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rostóvs’ and paid the eldest\ndaughter, Countess Véra, the attentions a young man pays when he intends\nto propose.\nNot in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at\nAusterlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He narrated"}, {"page": 618, "text": "that episode so persistently and with so important an air that everyone\nbelieved in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he had obtained two\ndecorations for Austerlitz.\nIn the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had picked\nup the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near the\ncommander in chief and had taken it to his commander. Just as he had done\nafter Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at such length and so insistently\nthat everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this, and he\nreceived two decorations for the Finnish war also. In 1809 he was a captain\nin the Guards, wore medals, and held some special lucrative posts in\nPetersburg.\nThough some skeptics smiled when told of Berg’s merits, it could not be\ndenied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent terms with\nhis superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant career before him and\nan assured position in society.\nFour years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow\ntheater, Berg had pointed out Véra Rostóva to him and had said in German,\n“das soll mein Weib werden,” * and from that moment had made up his\nmind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered the Rostóvs’\nposition and his own, he decided that the time had come to propose.\n* “That girl shall be my wife.”\nBerg’s proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not\nflattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure\nLivonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess Rostóva; but\nBerg’s chief characteristic was such a naïve and good natured egotism that\nthe Rostóvs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing, since he\nhimself was so firmly convinced that it was good, indeed excellent.\nMoreover, the Rostóvs’ affairs were seriously embarrassed, as the suitor\ncould not but know; and above all, Véra was twenty-four, had been taken\nout everywhere, and though she was certainly good-looking and sensible,\nno one up to now had proposed to her. So they gave their consent.\n“You see,” said Berg to his comrade, whom he called “friend” only\nbecause he knew that everyone has friends, “you see, I have considered it\nall, and should not marry if I had not thought it all out or if it were in any\nway unsuitable.

In the family’s\nfeeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and constraint was\nevident, as if they were ashamed of not having loved Véra sufficiently and\nof being so ready to get her off their hands. The old count felt this most. He\nwould probably have been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment,\nbut it resulted from the state of his affairs. He did not know at all how much\nhe had, what his debts amounted to, or what dowry he could give Véra.\nWhen his daughters were born he had assigned to each of them, for her\ndowry, an estate with three hundred serfs; but one of these estates had\nalready been sold, and the other was mortgaged and the interest so much in\narrears that it would have to be sold, so that it was impossible to give it to\nVéra. Nor had he any money.\nBerg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained\nbefore the wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the\nquestion of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At one time the count\nthought of giving her the Ryazán estate or of selling a forest, at another time\nof borrowing money on a note of hand.

But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did not\nknow for certain how much Véra would have and did not receive at least\npart of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters off.\n“Because, consider, Count—if I allowed myself to marry now without\nhaving definite means to maintain my wife, I should be acting badly....”\nThe conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and to\navoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand for\neighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on the\nshoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was impossible for\nhim to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in ready\nmoney. “Or at least twenty thousand, Count,” he added, “and then a note of\nhand for only sixty thousand.”\n“Yes, yes, all right!” said the count hurriedly. “Only excuse me, my dear\nfellow, I’ll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty thousand\nas well.

Before Sónya and her mother, if Borís\nhappened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of that episode as of some\nchildish, long-forgotten matter that was not worth mentioning. But in the\nsecret depths of her soul the question whether her engagement to Borís was\na jest or an important, binding promise tormented her.\nSince Borís left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the\nRostóvs. He had been in Moscow several times, and had passed near\nOtrádnoe, but had never been to see them.\nSometimes it occurred to Natásha that he did not wish to see her, and this\nconjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke of him.\n“Nowadays old friends are not remembered,” the countess would say\nwhen Borís was mentioned.\nAnna Mikháylovna also had of late visited them less frequently, seemed\nto hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke rapturously and\ngratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on which he had\nentered. When the Rostóvs came to Petersburg Borís called on them.\nHe drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of Natásha was\nhis most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention of letting\nher and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and\nNatásha could not be binding either on her or on him. He had a brilliant\nposition in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess Bezúkhova, a\nbrilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an important\npersonage whose complete confidence he enjoyed, and he was beginning to\nmake plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in Petersburg, plans\nwhich might very easily be realized.

This expression on\nhis face pleased Natásha.\n“Well, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?” asked the\ncountess.\nBorís kissed Natásha’s hand and said that he was astonished at the\nchange in her.\n“How handsome you have grown!”\n“I should think so!” replied Natásha’s laughing eyes.\n“And is Papa older?” she asked.\nNatásha sat down and, without joining in Borís’ conversation with the\ncountess, silently and minutely studied her childhood’s suitor. He felt the\nweight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her\noccasionally.\nBorís’ uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were all\ncomme il faut and in the latest fashion. This Natásha noticed at once. He sat\nrather sideways in the armchair next to the countess, arranging with his\nright hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand like a skin, and he\nspoke with a particularly refined compression of his lips about the\namusements of the highest Petersburg society, recalling with mild irony old\ntimes in Moscow and Moscow acquaintances. It was not accidentally,\nNatásha felt, that he alluded, when speaking of the highest aristocracy, to an\nambassador’s ball he had attended, and to invitations he had received from\nN.N. and S.S.\nAll this time Natásha sat silent, glancing up at him from under her brows.\nThis gaze disturbed and confused Borís more and more. He looked round\nmore frequently toward her, and broke off in what he was saying. He did\nnot stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave. The same\ninquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still looked at him.

It seemed to him that he ought to have\nan explanation with Natásha and tell her that the old times must be\nforgotten, that in spite of everything... she could not be his wife, that he had\nno means, and they would never let her marry him. But he failed to do so\nand felt awkward about entering on such an explanation. From day to day\nhe became more and more entangled. It seemed to her mother and Sónya\nthat Natásha was in love with Borís as of old. She sang him his favorite\nsongs, showed him her album, making him write in it, did not allow him to\nallude to the past, letting it be understood how delightful was the present;\nand every day he went away in a fog, without having said what he meant to,\nand not knowing what he was doing or why he came, or how it would all\nend.

The\ncountess—her prayerful mood dispelled—looked round and frowned. She\nwas finishing her last prayer: “Can it be that this couch will be my grave?”\nNatásha, flushed and eager, seeing her mother in prayer, suddenly checked\nher rush, half sat down, and unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding\nherself.

There’s no need for me to marry him.

All her\npowers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they all—she\nherself, Mamma, and Sónya—should be as well dressed as possible. Sónya\nand her mother put themselves entirely in her hands. The countess was to\nwear a claret-colored velvet dress, and the two girls white gauze over pink\nsilk slips, with roses on their bodices and their hair dressed à la grecque.\nEverything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks, and ears\nwashed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the openwork silk\nstockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on; the\nhairdressing was almost done. Sónya was finishing dressing and so was the\ncountess, but Natásha, who had bustled about helping them all, was\nbehindhand.

The prospect was so\nsplendid that she hardly believed it would come true, so out of keeping was\nit with the chill darkness and closeness of the carriage. She understood all\nthat awaited her only when, after stepping over the red baize at the entrance,\nshe entered the hall, took off her fur cloak, and, beside Sónya and in front of\nher mother, mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers.\nOnly then did she remember how she must behave at a ball, and tried to\nassume the majestic air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an\noccasion. But, fortunately for her, she felt her eyes growing misty, she saw\nnothing clearly, her pulse beat a hundred to the minute, and the blood\nthrobbed at her heart. She could not assume that pose, which would have\nmade her ridiculous, and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and\ntrying with all her might to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that\nbecame her best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering, also\ntalking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on the landing\nreflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with diamonds and\npearls on their bare necks and arms.\nNatásha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection\nfrom the others. All was blended into one brilliant procession. On entering\nthe ballroom the regular hum of voices, footsteps, and greetings deafened\nNatásha, and the light and glitter dazzled her still more. The host and\nhostess, who had already been standing at the door for half an hour\nrepeating the same words to the various arrivals, “Charmé de vous voir,” *\ngreeted the Rostóvs and Perónskaya in the same manner."}, {"page": 633, "text": "* “Delighted to see you.”\nThe two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her black hair,\nboth curtsied in the same way, but the hostess’ eye involuntarily rested\nlonger on the slim Natásha. She looked at her and gave her alone a special\nsmile in addition to her usual smile as hostess. Looking at her she may have\nrecalled the golden, irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own\nfirst ball. The host also followed Natásha with his eyes and asked the count\nwhich was his daughter.\n“Charming!” said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.\nIn the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the\nEmperor. The countess took up a position in one of the front rows of that\ncrowd. Natásha heard and felt that several people were asking about her and\nlooking at her. She realized that those noticing her liked her, and this\nobservation helped to calm her.\n“There are some like ourselves and some worse,” she thought.\nPerónskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people at\nthe ball.\n“That is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired man,” she\nsaid, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly hair, who\nwas surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said.\n“Ah, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess Bezúkhova,” said\nPerónskaya, indicating Hélène who had just entered. “How lovely! She is\nquite equal to Márya Antónovna. See how the men, young and old, pay\ncourt to her. Beautiful and clever... they say Prince —— is quite mad about\nher. But see, those two, though not good-looking, are even more run after.”\nShe pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very\nplain daughter.\n“She is a splendid match, a millionairess,” said Perónskaya. “And look,\nhere come her suitors.”\n“That is Bezúkhova’s brother, Anatole Kurágin,” she said, indicating a\nhandsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them with head erect,\nlooking at something over the heads of the ladies. “He’s handsome, isn’t\nhe? I hear they will marry him to that rich girl. But your cousin,\nDrubetskóy, is also very attentive to her. They say she has millions. Oh yes,\nthat’s the French ambassador himself!” she replied to the countess’ inquiry"}, {"page": 634, "text": "about Caulaincourt. “Looks as if he were a king!

He pushed through, evidently looking for\nsomeone.\nNatásha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, “the buffoon,” as\nPerónskaya had called him, and knew he was looking for them, and for her\nin particular. He had promised to be at the ball and introduce partners to her.\nBut before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome, dark\nman of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a window\ntalking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. Natásha at once recognized\nthe shorter and younger man in the white uniform: it was Bolkónski, who\nseemed to her to have grown much younger, happier, and better-looking.\n“There’s someone else we know—Bolkónski, do you see, Mamma?” said\nNatásha, pointing out Prince Andrew. “You remember, he stayed a night\nwith us at Otrádnoe.”\n“Oh, you know him?” said Perónskaya. “I can’t bear him. Il fait à présent\nla pluie et le beau temps. * He’s too proud for anything. Takes after his\nfather. And he’s hand in glove with Speránski, writing some project or\nother.

Behind him walked his\nhost and hostess. He walked in rapidly, bowing to right and left as if\nanxious to get the first moments of the reception over. The band played the\npolonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that had been set to\nit, beginning: “Alexander, Elisaveta, all our hearts you ravish quite...” The\nEmperor passed on to the drawing room, the crowd made a rush for the\ndoors, and several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again.\nThen the crowd hastily retired from the drawing room door, at which the\nEmperor reappeared talking to the hostess. A young man, looking\ndistraught, pounced down on the ladies, asking them to move aside. Some\nladies, with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules of\ndecorum, pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets. The men began to\nchoose partners and take their places for the polonaise.\nEveryone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing\nroom leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music. The\nhost followed with Márya Antónovna Narýshkina; then came ambassadors,\nministers, and various generals, whom Perónskaya diligently named. More\nthan half the ladies already had partners and were taking up, or preparing to\ntake up, their positions for the polonaise. Natásha felt that she would be left\nwith her mother and Sónya among a minority of women who crowded near\nthe wall, not having been invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms\nhanging down, her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly, and\nwith bated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed straight before her,\nevidently prepared for the height of joy or misery. She was not concerned\nabout the Emperor or any of those great people whom Perónskaya was\npointing out—she had but one thought: “Is it possible no one will ask me,\nthat I shall not be among the first to dance? Is it possible that not one of all"}, {"page": 636, "text": "these men will notice me? They do not even seem to see me, or if they do\nthey look as if they were saying, ‘Ah, she’s not the one I’m after, so it’s not\nworth looking at her!’ No, it’s impossible,” she thought. “They must know\nhow I long to dance, how splendidly I dance, and how they would enjoy\ndancing with me.”\nThe strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable\ntime, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Natásha’s ears. She\nwanted to cry. Perónskaya had left them. The count was at the other end of\nthe room. She and the countess and Sónya were standing by themselves as\nin the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers, with no one interested\nin them and not wanted by anyone. Prince Andrew with a lady passed by,\nevidently not recognizing them. The handsome Anatole was smilingly\ntalking to a partner on his arm and looked at Natásha as one looks at a wall.\nBorís passed them twice and each time turned away. Berg and his wife, who\nwere not dancing, came up to them.\nThis family gathering seemed humiliating to Natásha—as if there were\nnowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did not listen to\nor look at Véra, who was telling her something about her own green dress.\nAt last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced with\nthree) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the Rostóvs\nrequesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they were already\nclose to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the distinct, precise,\nenticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. The Emperor looked smilingly\ndown the room. A minute passed but no one had yet begun dancing. An\naide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went up to Countess Bezúkhova\nand asked her to dance. She smilingly raised her hand and laid it on his\nshoulder without looking at him. The aide-de-camp, an adept in his art,\ngrasping his partner firmly round her waist, with confident deliberation\nstarted smoothly, gliding first round the edge of the circle, then at the corner\nof the room he caught Hélène’s left hand and turned her, the only sound\naudible, apart from the ever-quickening music, being the rhythmic click of\nthe spurs on his rapid, agile feet, while at every third beat his partner’s\nvelvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round. Natásha\ngazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she who was dancing\nthat first turn of the waltz."}, {"page": 637, "text": "Prince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing\nstockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in the front\nrow of the circle not far from the Rostóvs. Baron Firhoff was talking to him\nabout the first sitting of the Council of State to be held next day. Prince\nAndrew, as one closely connected with Speránski and participating in the\nwork of the legislative commission, could give reliable information about\nthat sitting, concerning which various rumors were current. But not\nlistening to what Firhoff was saying, he was gazing now at the sovereign\nand now at the men intending to dance who had not yet gathered courage to\nenter the circle.\nPrince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor’s\npresence, and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to\ndance.\nPierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.\n“You always dance. I have a protégée, the young Rostóva, here. Ask her,”\nhe said.\n“Where is she?” asked Bolkónski. “Excuse me!” he added, turning to the\nbaron, “we will finish this conversation elsewhere—at a ball one must\ndance.” He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated. The\ndespairing, dejected expression of Natásha’s face caught his eye. He\nrecognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her début, remembered\nher conversation at the window, and with an expression of pleasure on his\nface approached Countess Rostóva.\n“Allow me to introduce you to my daughter,” said the countess, with\nheightened color.\n“I have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess\nremembers me,” said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite\nbelying Perónskaya’s remarks about his rudeness, and approaching Natásha\nhe held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his\ninvitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on Natásha’s\nface, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly brightened into a\nhappy, grateful, childlike smile.\n“I have long been waiting for you,” that frightened happy little girl\nseemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as she raised\nher hand to Prince Andrew’s shoulder. They were the second couple to enter\nthe circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of his day and"}, {"page": 638, "text": "Natásha danced exquisitely.

She noticed and saw nothing of\nwhat occupied everyone else. Not only did she fail to notice that the\nEmperor talked a long time with the French ambassador, and how\nparticularly gracious he was to a certain lady, or that Prince So-and-so and\nSo-and-so did and said this and that, and that Hélène had great success and\nwas honored by the special attention of So-and-so, but she did not even see\nthe Emperor, and only noticed that he had gone because the ball became\nlivelier after his departure. For one of the merry cotillions before supper\nPrince Andrew was again her partner. He reminded her of their first\nencounter in the Otrádnoe avenue, and how she had been unable to sleep\nthat moonlight night, and told her how he had involuntarily overheard her.\nNatásha blushed at that recollection and tried to excuse herself, as if there\nhad been something to be ashamed of in what Prince Andrew had\noverheard.\nLike all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked meeting\nsomeone there not of the conventional society stamp. And such was\nNatásha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and even her mistakes\nin speaking French. With her he behaved with special care and tenderness,\nsitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most unimportant matters;\nhe admired her shy grace. In the middle of the cotillion, having completed\none of the figures, Natásha, still out of breath, was returning to her seat\nwhen another dancer chose her. She was tired and panting and evidently\nthought of declining, but immediately put her hand gaily on the man’s\nshoulder, smiling at Prince Andrew.\n“I’d be glad to sit beside you and rest: I’m tired; but you see how they\nkeep asking me, and I’m glad of it, I’m happy and I love everybody, and"}, {"page": 640, "text": "you and I understand it all,” and much, much more was said in her smile.\nWhen her partner left her Natásha ran across the room to choose two ladies\nfor the figure.\n“If she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she will be my\nwife,” said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own surprise, as he\nwatched her. She did go first to her cousin.\n“What rubbish sometimes enters one’s head!” thought Prince Andrew,\n“but what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original, that she\nwon’t be dancing here a month before she will be married.... Such as she are\nrare here,” he thought, as Natásha, readjusting a rose that was slipping on\nher bodice, settled herself beside him.\nWhen the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to the\ndancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and asked his\ndaughter whether she was enjoying herself. Natásha did not answer at once\nbut only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully: “How can you ask\nsuch a question?”\n“I have never enjoyed myself so much before!” she said, and Prince\nAndrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her father\nand instantly dropped again. Natásha was happier than she had ever been in\nher life. She was at that height of bliss when one becomes completely kind\nand good and does not believe in the possibility of evil, unhappiness, or\nsorrow.\nAt that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position his\nwife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and absent-minded. A deep\nfurrow ran across his forehead, and standing by a window he stared over his\nspectacles seeing no one.\nOn her way to supper Natásha passed him.\nPierre’s gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of him.\nShe wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of her own\nhappiness.\n“How delightful it is, Count!” said she. “Isn’t it?”\nPierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said.\n“Yes, I am very glad,” he said.\n“How can people be dissatisfied with anything?” thought Natásha.\n“Especially such a capital fellow as Bezúkhov!” In Natásha’s eyes all the"}, {"page": 641, "text": "people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid people, loving one\nanother; none of them capable of injuring another—and so they ought all to\nbe happy."}, {"page": 642, "text": "CHAPTER XVIII\nNext day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did not dwell\non it long. “Yes, it was a very brilliant ball,” and then... “Yes, that little\nRostóva is very charming.

He kept criticizing his own work, as he often did,\nand was glad when he heard someone coming.\nThe visitor was Bítski, who served on various committees, frequented all\nthe societies in Petersburg, and was a passionate devotee of the new ideas\nand of Speránski, and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger—one of those men\nwho choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion, but\nwho for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans.

He had just heard particulars of\nthat morning’s sitting of the Council of State opened by the Emperor, and\nhe spoke of it enthusiastically. The Emperor’s speech had been\nextraordinary. It had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs\ndeliver. “The Sovereign plainly said that the Council and Senate are estates\nof the realm, he said that the government must rest not on authority but on\nsecure bases. The Emperor said that the fiscal system must be reorganized\nand the accounts published,” recounted Bítski, emphasizing certain words\nand opening his eyes significantly.\n“Ah, yes! Today’s events mark an epoch, the greatest epoch in our\nhistory,” he concluded.\nPrince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the Council of\nState, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached\nsuch importance, and was surprised that this event, now that it had taken"}, {"page": 643, "text": "place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite insignificant. He listened\nwith quiet irony to Bítski’s enthusiastic account of it. A very simple thought\noccurred to him: “What does it matter to me or to Bítski what the Emperor\nwas pleased to say at the Council? Can all that make me any happier or\nbetter?”\nAnd this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince\nAndrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to dine that\nevening at Speránski’s, “with only a few friends,” as the host had said when\ninviting him. The prospect of that dinner in the intimate home circle of the\nman he so admired had greatly interested Prince Andrew, especially as he\nhad not yet seen Speránski in his domestic surroundings, but now he felt\ndisinclined to go to it.\nAt the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house Speránski\nowned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room of this small\nhouse, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting that of a\nmonastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the friendly\ngathering of Speránski’s intimate acquaintances already assembled at five\no’clock. There were no ladies present except Speránski’s little daughter\n(long-faced like her father) and her governess. The other guests were\nGervais, Magnítski, and Stolýpin. While still in the anteroom Prince\nAndrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugh—a laugh such as\none hears on the stage. Someone—it sounded like Speránski—was\ndistinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew had never before heard\nSperánski’s famous laugh, and this ringing, high-pitched laughter from a\nstatesman made a strange impression on him.\nHe entered the dining room. The whole company were standing between\ntwo windows at a small table laid with hors-d’oeuvres. Speránski, wearing a\ngray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast, and evidently still the same\nwaistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of the Council of\nState, stood at the table with a beaming countenance. His guests surrounded\nhim. Magnítski, addressing himself to Speránski, was relating an anecdote,\nand Speránski was laughing in advance at what Magnítski was going to say.\nWhen Prince Andrew entered the room Magnítski’s words were again\ncrowned by laughter. Stolýpin gave a deep bass guffaw as he munched a\npiece of bread and cheese. Gervais laughed softly with a hissing chuckle,\nand Speránski in a high-pitched staccato manner."}, {"page": 644, "text": "Still laughing, Speránski held out his soft white hand to Prince Andrew.\n“Very pleased to see you, Prince,” he said. “One moment...” he went on,\nturning to Magnítski and interrupting his story. “We have agreed that this is\na dinner for recreation, with not a word about business!” and turning again\nto the narrator he began to laugh afresh.\nPrince Andrew looked at the laughing Speránski with astonishment,\nregret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not Speránski but\nsomeone else. Everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and\nfascinating in Speránski suddenly became plain and unattractive.\nAt dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to\nconsist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before Magnítski had\nfinished his story someone else was anxious to relate something still\nfunnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the state service, related to\npeople in the service. It seemed that in this company the insignificance of\nthose people was so definitely accepted that the only possible attitude\ntoward them was one of good humored ridicule. Speránski related how at\nthe Council that morning a deaf dignitary, when asked his opinion, replied\nthat he thought so too. Gervais gave a long account of an official revision,\nremarkable for the stupidity of everybody concerned. Stolýpin, stuttering,\nbroke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that\nexisted under the former order of things—threatening to give a serious turn\nto the conversation. Magnítski starting quizzing Stolýpin about his\nvehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk reverted to its\nformer lively tone.\nEvidently Speránski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement in a\ncircle of friends, and his guests, understanding his wish, tried to enliven him\nand amuse themselves. But their gaiety seemed to Prince Andrew mirthless\nand tiresome. Speránski’s high-pitched voice struck him unpleasantly, and\nthe incessant laughter grated on him like a false note. Prince Andrew did\nnot laugh and feared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the\ncompany, but no one took any notice of his being out of harmony with the\ngeneral mood. They all seemed very gay.\nHe tried several times to join in the conversation, but his remarks were\ntossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water, and he could not\njest with them."}, {"page": 645, "text": "There was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was witty and\nmight have been funny, but it lacked just that something which is the salt of\nmirth, and they were not even aware that such a thing existed.\nAfter dinner Speránski’s daughter and her governess rose. He patted the\nlittle girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that gesture, too, seemed\nunnatural to Prince Andrew.\nThe men remained at table over their port—English fashion. In the midst\nof a conversation that was started about Napoleon’s Spanish affairs, which\nthey all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to express a contrary\nopinion. Speránski smiled and, with an evident wish to prevent the\nconversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a story that had no\nconnection with the previous conversation. For a few moments all were\nsilent.\nHaving sat some time at table, Speránski corked a bottle of wine and,\nremarking, “Nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,” passed it to\nthe servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly went into the\ndrawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were handed to Speránski\nand he took them to his study. As soon as he had left the room the general\nmerriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly and quietly\nwith one another.\n“Now for the recitation!” said Speránski on returning from his study. “A\nwonderful talent!” he said to Prince Andrew, and Magnítski immediately\nassumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in French which\nhe had composed about various well-known Petersburg people. He was\ninterrupted several times by applause. When the verses were finished Prince\nAndrew went up to Speránski and took his leave.\n“Where are you off to so early?” asked Speránski.\n“I promised to go to a reception.”\nThey said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike,\nimpenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have\nexpected anything from Speránski and from any of his own activities\nconnected with him, or ever to have attributed importance to what\nSperánski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang in Prince\nAndrew’s ears long after he had left the house."}, {"page": 646, "text": "When he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in\nPetersburg during those last four months as if it were something new. He\nrecalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of his project of\narmy reform, which had been accepted for consideration and which they\nwere trying to pass over in silence simply because another, a very poor one,\nhad already been prepared and submitted to the Emperor. He thought of the\nmeetings of a committee of which Berg was a member. He remembered\nhow carefully and at what length everything relating to form and procedure\nwas discussed at those meetings, and how sedulously and promptly all that\nrelated to the gist of the business was evaded. He recalled his labors on the\nLegal Code, and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of the\nRoman and French codes into Russian, and he felt ashamed of himself.\nThen he vividly pictured to himself Boguchárovo, his occupations in the\ncountry, his journey to Ryazán; he remembered the peasants and Dron the\nvillage elder, and mentally applying to them the Personal Rights he had\ndivided into paragraphs, he felt astonished that he could have spent so much\ntime on such useless work."}, {"page": 647, "text": "CHAPTER XIX\nNext day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before,\nand among them at the Rostóvs’ with whom he had renewed acquaintance\nat the ball. Apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the\ncall, he wanted to see that original, eager girl who had left such a pleasant\nimpression on his mind, in her own home.\nNatásha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing a dark-blue\nhouse dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier than in her\nball dress. She and all the Rostóv family welcomed him as an old friend,\nsimply and cordially. The whole family, whom he had formerly judged\nseverely, now seemed to him to consist of excellent, simple, and kindly\npeople. The old count’s hospitality and good nature, which struck one\nespecially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise, were such that Prince\nAndrew could not refuse to stay to dinner. “Yes,” he thought, “they are\ncapital people, who of course have not the slightest idea what a treasure\nthey possess in Natásha; but they are kindly folk and form the best possible\nsetting for this strikingly poetic, charming girl, overflowing with life!”\nIn Natásha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely\nalien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world, that in\nthe Otrádnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had already\nbegun to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no longer and\nwas no longer alien to him, but he himself having entered it found in it a\nnew enjoyment.\nAfter dinner Natásha, at Prince Andrew’s request, went to the clavichord\nand began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies\nand listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and\nsuddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had thought impossible for him.\nHe looked at Natásha as she sang, and something new and joyful stirred in\nhis soul. He felt happy and at the same time sad. He had absolutely nothing\nto weep about yet he was ready to weep. What about? His former love? The"}, {"page": 648, "text": "little princess? His disillusionments?... His hopes for the future?... Yes and\nno. The chief reason was a sudden, vivid sense of the terrible contrast\nbetween something infinitely great and illimitable within him and that\nlimited and material something that he, and even she, was. This contrast\nweighed on and yet cheered him while she sang.\nAs soon as Natásha had finished she went up to him and asked how he\nliked her voice. She asked this and then became confused, feeling that she\nought not to have asked it. He smiled, looking at her, and said he liked her\nsinging as he liked everything she did.\nPrince Andrew left the Rostóvs’ late in the evening. He went to bed from\nhabit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. Having lit his candle he sat\nup in bed, then got up, then lay down again not at all troubled by his\nsleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had stepped out of a\nstuffy room into God’s own fresh air. It did not enter his head that he was in\nlove with Natásha; he was not thinking about her, but only picturing her to\nhimself, and in consequence all life appeared in a new light. “Why do I\nstrive, why do I toil in this narrow, confined frame, when life, all life with\nall its joys, is open to me?” said he to himself. And for the first time for a\nvery long while he began making happy plans for the future. He decided\nthat he must attend to his son’s education by finding a tutor and putting the\nboy in his charge, then he ought to retire from the service and go abroad,\nand see England, Switzerland and Italy. “I must use my freedom while I feel\nso much strength and youth in me,” he said to himself. “Pierre was right\nwhen he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order to be\nhappy, and now I do believe in it. Let the dead bury their dead, but while\none has life one must live and be happy!” thought he."}, {"page": 649, "text": "CHAPTER XX\nOne morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in\nMoscow and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an immaculate\nbrand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his\ntemples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.\n“I have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately she could\nnot grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more fortunate with\nyou,” he said with a smile.\n“What is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.”\n“I have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count” (Berg said this with\nperfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable), “and so\nI wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wife’s friends.” (He\nsmiled still more pleasantly.) “I wished to ask the countess and you to do\nme the honor of coming to tea and to supper.”\nOnly Countess Hélène, considering the society of such people as the\nBergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation. Berg\nexplained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small but select\ncompany, and why this would give him pleasure, and why though he\ngrudged spending money on cards or anything harmful, he was prepared to\nrun into some expense for the sake of good society—that Pierre could not\nrefuse, and promised to come.\n“But don’t be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten minutes to\neight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general is coming. He is very\ngood to me. We shall have supper, Count. So you will do me the favor.”\nContrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at the Bergs’\nhouse, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.\nHaving prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were ready\nfor their guests’ arrival."}, {"page": 650, "text": "In their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and pictures and\nnew furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely buttoned up in his new\nuniform, sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always could and\nshould be acquainted with people above one, because only then does one\nget satisfaction from acquaintances.\n“You can get to know something, you can ask for something. See how I\nmanaged from my first promotion.” (Berg measured his life not by years\nbut by promotions.) “My comrades are still nobodies, while I am only\nwaiting for a vacancy to command a regiment, and have the happiness to be\nyour husband.” (He rose and kissed Véra’s hand, and on the way to her\nstraightened out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) “And how have I\nobtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances. It\ngoes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical.”\nBerg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and\npaused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak woman\nwho could not understand all that constitutes a man’s dignity, what it was\nein Mann zu sein. * Véra at the same time smiling with a sense of\nsuperiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the same\nunderstood life wrongly, as according to Véra all men did. Berg, judging by\nhis wife, thought all women weak and foolish. Véra, judging only by her\nhusband and generalizing from that observation, supposed that all men,\nthough they understand nothing and are conceited and selfish, ascribe\ncommon sense to themselves alone.\n* To be a man.\nBerg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush her lace\nfichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on the lips.\n“The only thing is, we mustn’t have children too soon,” he continued,\nfollowing an unconscious sequence of ideas.\n“Yes,” answered Véra, “I don’t at all want that. We must live for society.”\n“Princess Yusúpova wore one exactly like this,” said Berg, pointing to the\nfichu with a happy and kindly smile.\nJust then Count Bezúkhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced at\none another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally claiming\nthe honor of this visit."}, {"page": 651, "text": "“This is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances,” thought\nBerg. “This is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself.”\n“But please don’t interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests,” said\nVéra, “because I know what interests each of them and what to say to\ndifferent people.”\nBerg smiled again.\n“It can’t be helped: men must sometimes have masculine conversation,”\nsaid he.\nThey received Pierre in their small, new drawing room, where it was\nimpossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry, neatness,\nand order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that Berg, having\ngenerously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair or of the sofa for\nhis dear guest, but being apparently painfully undecided on the matter\nhimself, eventually left the visitor to settle the question of selection. Pierre\ndisturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself, and Berg and Véra\nimmediately began their evening party, interrupting each other in their\nefforts to entertain their guest.\nVéra, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be entertained\nwith conversation about the French embassy, at once began accordingly.\nBerg, having decided that masculine conversation was required, interrupted\nhis wife’s remarks and touched on the question of the war with Austria, and\nunconsciously jumped from the general subject to personal considerations\nas to the proposals made him to take part in the Austrian campaign and the\nreasons why he had declined them. Though the conversation was very\nincoherent and Véra was angry at the intrusion of the masculine element,\nboth husband and wife felt with satisfaction that, even if only one guest was\npresent, their evening had begun very well and was as like as two peas to\nevery other evening party with its talk, tea, and lighted candles.\nBefore long Borís, Berg’s old comrade, arrived. There was a shade of\ncondescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and Véra. After Borís\ncame a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the Rostóvs,\nand the party became unquestionably exactly like all other evening parties.\nBerg and Véra could not repress their smiles of satisfaction at the sight of\nall this movement in their drawing room, at the sound of the disconnected\ntalk, the rustling of dresses, and the bowing and scraping.

At the card table he happened to\nbe directly facing Natásha, and was struck by a curious change that had\ncome over her since the ball. She was silent, and not only less pretty than at\nthe ball, but only redeemed from plainness by her look of gentle\nindifference to everything around.\n“What’s the matter with her?” thought Pierre, glancing at her. She was\nsitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without looking at him,\nmade some reply to Borís who sat down beside her. After playing out a\nwhole suit and to his partner’s delight taking five tricks, Pierre, hearing\ngreetings and the steps of someone who had entered the room while he was\npicking up his tricks, glanced again at Natásha.\n“What has happened to her?” he asked himself with still greater surprise.\nPrince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to her with a\nlook of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, was looking up at\nhim, flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing. And the\nbright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again alight in\nher. She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had again\nbecome what she had been at the ball.\nPrince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and\nyouthful expression in his friend’s face.\nPierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now with his\nback to Natásha and now facing her, but during the whole of the six rubbers\nhe watched her and his friend.\n“Something very important is happening between them,” thought Pierre,\nand a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him\nneglect the game."}, {"page": 654, "text": "After six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use playing like\nthat, and Pierre was released. Natásha on one side was talking with Sónya\nand Borís, and Véra with a subtle smile was saying something to Prince\nAndrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking whether they were talking\nsecrets, sat down beside them. Véra, having noticed Prince Andrew’s\nattentions to Natásha, decided that at a party, a real evening party, subtle\nallusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and, seizing a\nmoment when Prince Andrew was alone, began a conversation with him\nabout feelings in general and about her sister. With so intellectual a guest as\nshe considered Prince Andrew to be, she felt that she had to employ her\ndiplomatic tact.\nWhen Pierre went up to them he noticed that Véra was being carried\naway by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed,\na thing that rarely happened with him.\n“What do you think?” Véra was saying with an arch smile. “You are so\ndiscerning, Prince, and understand people’s characters so well at a glance.\nWhat do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her attachments?\nCould she, like other women” (Véra meant herself), “love a man once for\nall and remain true to him forever? That is what I consider true love. What\ndo you think, Prince?”\n“I know your sister too little,” replied Prince Andrew, with a sarcastic\nsmile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment, “to be able to\nsolve so delicate a question, and then I have noticed that the less attractive a\nwoman is the more constant she is likely to be,” he added, and looked up at\nPierre who was just approaching them.\n“Yes, that is true, Prince. In our days,” continued Véra—mentioning “our\ndays” as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing, imagining that\nthey have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of “our days” and that\nhuman characteristics change with the times—“in our days a girl has so\nmuch freedom that the pleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling in\nher. And it must be confessed that Natalie is very susceptible.” This return\nto the subject of Natalie caused Prince Andrew to knit his brows with\ndiscomfort: he was about to rise, but Véra continued with a still more subtle\nsmile:\n“I think no one has been more courted than she,” she went on, “but till\nquite lately she never cared seriously for anyone. Now you know, Count,”"}, {"page": 655, "text": "she said to Pierre, “even our dear cousin Borís, who, between ourselves,\nwas very far gone in the land of tenderness...” (alluding to a map of love\nmuch in vogue at that time).\nPrince Andrew frowned and remained silent.\n“You are friendly with Borís, aren’t you?” asked Véra.\n“Yes, I know him....”\n“I expect he has told you of his childish love for Natásha?”\n“Oh, there was childish love?” suddenly asked Prince Andrew, blushing\nunexpectedly.\n“Yes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love. Le\ncousinage est un dangereux voisinage. * Don’t you think so?”\n* “Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.”\n“Oh, undoubtedly!” said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural\nliveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful with\nhis fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these jesting remarks\nhe rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside.\n“Well?” asked Pierre, seeing his friend’s strange animation with surprise,\nand noticing the glance he turned on Natásha as he rose.\n“I must... I must have a talk with you,” said Prince Andrew. “You know\nthat pair of women’s gloves?” (He referred to the Masonic gloves given to a\nnewly initiated Brother to present to the woman he loved.) “I... but no, I\nwill talk to you later on,” and with a strange light in his eyes and\nrestlessness in his movements, Prince Andrew approached Natásha and sat\ndown beside her.

The smile of pleasure never left his face.\nThe party was very successful and quite like other parties he had seen.\nEverything was similar: the ladies’ subtle talk, the cards, the general raising\nhis voice at the card table, and the samovar and the tea cakes; only one\nthing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening parties he wished\nto imitate.

Not only in the\nsoul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured Natásha, but in the whole\nhouse, there was a feeling of awe at something important that was bound to\nhappen. The countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes at Prince\nAndrew when he talked to Natásha and timidly started some artificial\nconversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way. Sónya was afraid to\nleave Natásha and afraid of being in the way when she was with them.\nNatásha grew pale, in a panic of expectation, when she remained alone with\nhim for a moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by his timidity. She felt that\nhe wanted to say something to her but could not bring himself to do so.\nIn the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to\nNatásha and whispered: “Well, what?”\n“Mamma! For heaven’s sake don’t ask me anything now! One can’t talk\nabout that,” said Natásha.\nBut all the same that night Natásha, now agitated and now frightened, lay\na long time in her mother’s bed gazing straight before her. She told her how\nhe had complimented her, how he told her he was going abroad, asked her\nwhere they were going to spend the summer, and then how he had asked her\nabout Borís.\n“But such a... such a... never happened to me before!” she said. “Only I\nfeel afraid in his presence. I am always afraid when I’m with him. What\ndoes that mean? Does it mean that it’s the real thing? Yes?

Mummy!\nsuch a thing never happened to me before,” she said, surprised and alarmed\nat the feeling she was aware of in herself. “And could we ever have\nthought!...”\nIt seemed to Natásha that even at the time she first saw Prince Andrew at\nOtrádnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as if she feared this\nstrange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had then\nchosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and of finding him, as it\nseemed, not indifferent to her.\n“And it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg while\nwe are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that ball. It is fate.\nClearly it is fate that everything led up to this! Already then, directly I saw\nhim I felt something peculiar.”\n“What else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...” said\nher mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew had\nwritten in Natásha’s album.\n“Mamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?”\n“Don’t, Natásha! Pray to God. ‘Marriages are made in heaven,’” said her\nmother.\n“Darling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!” cried Natásha,\nshedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother.\nAt that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him\nof his love for Natásha and his firm resolve to make her his wife.\nThat day Countess Hélène had a reception at her house. The French\nambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late\nbecome a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies and gentlemen.\nPierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the rooms and struck\neveryone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and morose air.\nSince the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression and\nhad made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the intimacy of his wife with\nthe royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly been made a gentleman of the\nbedchamber, and from that time he had begun to feel oppressed and\nashamed in court society, and dark thoughts of the vanity of all things\nhuman came to him oftener than before. At the same time the feeling he had\nnoticed between his protégée Natásha and Prince Andrew accentuated his"}, {"page": 659, "text": "gloom by the contrast between his own position and his friend’s. He tried\nequally to avoid thinking about his wife, and about Natásha and Prince\nAndrew; and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison\nwith eternity; again the question: for what? presented itself; and he forced\nhimself to work day and night at Masonic labors, hoping to drive away the\nevil spirit that threatened him. Toward midnight, after he had left the\ncountess’ apartments, he was sitting upstairs in a shabby dressing gown,\ncopying out the original transaction of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a\ntable in his low room cloudy with tobacco smoke, when someone came in.\nIt was Prince Andrew.\n“Ah, it’s you!” said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air. “And I,\nyou see, am hard at it.” He pointed to his manuscript book with that air of\nescaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at their work.\nPrince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life on\nhis face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look, smiled at\nhim with the egotism of joy.\n“Well, dear heart,” said he, “I wanted to tell you about it yesterday and I\nhave come to do so today. I never experienced anything like it before. I am\nin love, my friend!”\nSuddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down\non the sofa beside Prince Andrew.\n“With Natásha Rostóva, yes?” said he.\n“Yes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it, but the\nfeeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and suffered, but I\nwould not exchange even that torment for anything in the world, I have not\nlived till now. At last I live, but I can’t live without her! But can she love\nme?... I am too old for her.... Why don’t you speak?”\n“I? I? What did I tell you?” said Pierre suddenly, rising and beginning to\npace up and down the room. “I always thought it.... That girl is such a\ntreasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend, I entreat you, don’t\nphilosophize, don’t doubt, marry, marry, marry.... And I am sure there will\nnot be a happier man than you.”\n“But what of her?”\n“She loves you.”"}, {"page": 660, "text": "“Don’t talk rubbish...” said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking into\nPierre’s eyes.\n“She does, I know,” Pierre cried fiercely.\n“But do listen,” returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the arm. “Do\nyou know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to someone.”\n“Well, go on, go on. I am very glad,” said Pierre, and his face really\nchanged, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince Andrew.\nPrince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a different, quite a new man.\nWhere was his spleen, his contempt for life, his disillusionment? Pierre was\nthe only person to whom he made up his mind to speak openly; and to him\nhe told all that was in his soul. Now he boldly and lightly made plans for an\nextended future, said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his father’s\ncaprice, and spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this\nmarriage and love her, or would do without his consent; then he marveled at\nthe feeling that had mastered him as at something strange, apart from and\nindependent of himself.\n“I should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of\nsuch love,” said Prince Andrew. “It is not at all the same feeling that I knew\nin the past. The whole world is now for me divided into two halves: one\nhalf is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the other half is everything\nwhere she is not, and there is all gloom and darkness....”\n“Darkness and gloom,” reiterated Pierre: “yes, yes, I understand that.”\n“I cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very happy!\nYou understand me? I know you are glad for my sake.”\n“Yes, yes,” Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched and sad\nexpression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrew’s lot appeared to him,\nthe gloomier seemed his own."}, {"page": 661, "text": "CHAPTER XXIII\nPrince Andrew needed his father’s consent to his marriage, and to obtain\nthis he started for the country next day.\nHis father received his son’s communication with external composure,\nbut inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter\nhis life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life was already\nending. “If only they would let me end my days as I want to,” thought the\nold man, “then they might do as they please.” With his son, however, he\nemployed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and, adopting\na quiet tone, discussed the whole matter.\nIn the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards birth,\nwealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young as he had\nbeen and his health was poor (the old man laid special stress on this), while\nshe was very young. Thirdly, he had a son whom it would be a pity to\nentrust to a chit of a girl. “Fourthly and finally,” the father said, looking\nironically at his son, “I beg you to put it off for a year: go abroad, take a\ncure, look out as you wanted to for a German tutor for Prince Nicholas.\nThen if your love or passion or obstinacy—as you please—is still as great,\nmarry! And that’s my last word on it. Mind, the last...” concluded the\nprince, in a tone which showed that nothing would make him alter his\ndecision.\nPrince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings, or his\nfiancée’s, would not stand a year’s test, or that he (the old prince himself)\nwould die before then, and he decided to conform to his father’s wish—to\npropose, and postpone the wedding for a year.\nThree weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rostóvs, Prince\nAndrew returned to Petersburg."}, {"page": 662, "text": "Next day after her talk with her mother Natásha expected Bolkónski all\nday, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the same.\nPierre did not come either and Natásha, not knowing that Prince Andrew\nhad gone to see his father, could not explain his absence to herself.\nThree weeks passed in this way. Natásha had no desire to go out\nanywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and listless;\nshe wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the evenings. She\nblushed continually and was irritable. It seemed to her that everybody knew\nabout her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying her. Strong as\nwas her inward grief, this wound to her vanity intensified her misery.\nOnce she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly began\nto cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why it\nis being punished.\nThe countess began to soothe Natásha, who after first listening to her\nmother’s words, suddenly interrupted her:\n“Leave off, Mamma! I don’t think, and don’t want to think about it! He\njust came and then left off, left off....”\nHer voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and went\non quietly:\n“And I don’t at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I have\nnow become quite calm, quite calm.”\nThe day after this conversation Natásha put on the old dress which she\nknew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the\nmornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had\nabandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went to the\nballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud resonance, and began\nsinging her solfeggio. When she had finished her first exercise she stood\nstill in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that particularly\npleased her. She listened joyfully (as though she had not expected it) to the\ncharm of the notes reverberating, filling the whole empty ballroom, and\nslowly dying away; and all at once she felt cheerful. “What’s the good of\nmaking so much of it? Things are nice as it is,” she said to herself, and she\nbegan walking up and down the room, not stepping simply on the\nresounding parquet but treading with each step from the heel to the toe (she\nhad on a new and favorite pair of shoes) and listening to the regular tap of\nthe heel and creak of the toe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own"}, {"page": 663, "text": "voice. Passing a mirror she glanced into it. “There, that’s me!” the\nexpression of her face seemed to say as she caught sight of herself. “Well,\nand very nice too! I need nobody.”\nA footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but\nshe would not let him, and having closed the door behind him continued her\nwalk. That morning she had returned to her favorite mood—love of, and\ndelight in, herself. “How charming that Natásha is!” she said again,\nspeaking as some third, collective, male person. “Pretty, a good voice,\nyoung, and in nobody’s way if only they leave her in peace.” But however\nmuch they left her in peace she could not now be at peace, and immediately\nfelt this.\nIn the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, “At home?” and\nthen footsteps were heard. Natásha was looking at the mirror, but did not\nsee herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When she saw herself, her\nface was pale. It was he. She knew this for certain, though she hardly heard\nhis voice through the closed doors.\nPale and agitated, Natásha ran into the drawing room.\n“Mamma! Bolkónski has come!” she said. “Mamma, it is awful, it is\nunbearable! I don’t want... to be tormented? What am I to do?...”\nBefore the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room with\nan agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw Natásha his face brightened.\nHe kissed the countess’ hand and Natásha’s, and sat down beside the sofa.\n“It is long since we had the pleasure...” began the countess, but Prince\nAndrew interrupted her by answering her intended question, obviously in\nhaste to say what he had to.\n“I have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my\nfather’s. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I only got back\nlast night,” he said glancing at Natásha; “I want to have a talk with you,\nCountess,” he added after a moment’s pause.\nThe countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.\n“I am at your disposal,” she murmured.\nNatásha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so:\nsomething gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared straight\nat Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes.\n“At once? This instant!... No, it can’t be!” she thought."}, {"page": 664, "text": "Again he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she was not\nmistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, her fate would be decided.\n“Go, Natásha! I will call you,” said the countess in a whisper.\nNatásha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at\nher mother and went out.\n“I have come, Countess, to ask for your daughter’s hand,” said Prince\nAndrew.\nThe countess’ face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.\n“Your offer...” she began at last sedately. He remained silent, looking into\nher eyes. “Your offer...” (she grew confused) “is agreeable to us, and I\naccept your offer. I am glad. And my husband... I hope... but it will depend\non her....”\n“I will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it to me?”\nsaid Prince Andrew.\n“Yes,” replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and with a\nmixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his\nforehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him as a son,\nbut felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man. “I am sure my\nhusband will consent,” said the countess, “but your father...”\n“My father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express\ncondition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a year. And\nI wished to tell you of that,” said Prince Andrew.\n“It is true that Natásha is still young, but—so long as that?...”\n“It is unavoidable,” said Prince Andrew with a sigh.\n“I will send her to you,” said the countess, and left the room.\n“Lord have mercy upon us!” she repeated while seeking her daughter.\nSónya said that Natásha was in her bedroom. Natásha was sitting on the\nbed, pale and dry-eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering\nsomething as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped up\nand flew to her.\n“Well, Mamma?... Well?...”\n“Go, go to him. He is asking for your hand,” said the countess, coldly it\nseemed to Natásha. “Go... go,” said the mother, sadly and reproachfully,\nwith a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away."}, {"page": 665, "text": "Natásha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When she\ncame in and saw him she paused. “Is it possible that this stranger has now\nbecome everything to me?” she asked herself, and immediately answered,\n“Yes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than everything in the\nworld.” Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast eyes.\n“I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?”\nHe looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of\nher face. Her face said: “Why ask? Why doubt what you cannot but know?\nWhy speak, when words cannot express what one feels?”\nShe drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it.\n“Do you love me?”\n“Yes, yes!” Natásha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed loudly\nand, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.\n“What is it? What’s the matter?”\n“Oh, I am so happy!” she replied, smiled through her tears, bent over\ncloser to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she might,\nand then kissed him.\nPrince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find in\nhis heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly changed;\nthere was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire, but there\nwas pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear at her devotion and\ntrustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful sense of the duty that now bound\nhim to her forever. The present feeling, though not so bright and poetic as\nthe former, was stronger and more serious.\n“Did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?” asked Prince\nAndrew, still looking into her eyes.\n“Is it possible that I—the ‘chit of a girl,’ as everybody called me,”\nthought Natásha—“is it possible that I am now to be the wife and the equal\nof this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father looks up to? Can it\nbe true? Can it be true that there can be no more playing with life, that now\nI am grown up, that on me now lies a responsibility for my every word and\ndeed? Yes, but what did he ask me?”\n“No,” she replied, but she had not understood his question."}, {"page": 666, "text": "“Forgive me!” he said. “But you are so young, and I have already been\nthrough so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know yourself.”\nNatásha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing to take in\nthe meaning of his words.\n“Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be,” continued Prince\nAndrew, “it will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask you to make me\nhappy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall remain a secret, and\nshould you find that you do not love me, or should you come to love...” said\nPrince Andrew with an unnatural smile.\n“Why do you say that?” Natásha interrupted him. “You know that from\nthe very day you first came to Otrádnoe I have loved you,” she cried, quite\nconvinced that she spoke the truth.\n“In a year you will learn to know yourself....”\n“A whole year!” Natásha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that the\nmarriage was to be postponed for a year. “But why a year? Why a year?...”\nPrince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay. Natásha\ndid not hear him.\n“And can’t it be helped?” she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply, but his\nface expressed the impossibility of altering that decision.\n“It’s awful! Oh, it’s awful! awful!” Natásha suddenly cried, and again\nburst into sobs. “I shall die, waiting a year: it’s impossible, it’s awful!” She\nlooked into her lover’s face and saw in it a look of commiseration and\nperplexity.\n“No, no! I’ll do anything!” she said, suddenly checking her tears. “I am\nso happy.”\nThe father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple\ntheir blessing.\nFrom that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostóvs’ as Natásha’s\naffianced lover."}, {"page": 667, "text": "CHAPTER XXIV\nNo betrothal ceremony took place and Natásha’s engagement to\nBolkónski was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He said that\nas he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it;\nthat he had given his word and bound himself forever, but that he did not\nwish to bind Natásha and gave her perfect freedom. If after six months she\nfelt that she did not love him she would have full right to reject him.\nNaturally neither Natásha nor her parents wished to hear of this, but Prince\nAndrew was firm. He came every day to the Rostóvs’, but did not behave to\nNatásha as an affianced lover: he did not use the familiar thou, but said you\nto her, and kissed only her hand. After their engagement, quite different,\nintimate, and natural relations sprang up between them. It was as if they had\nnot known each other till now. Both liked to recall how they had regarded\neach other when as yet they were nothing to one another; they felt\nthemselves now quite different beings: then they were artificial, now natural\nand sincere. At first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with\nPrince Andrew; he seemed a man from another world, and for a long time\nNatásha trained the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them all that\nhe only appeared to be different, but was really just like all of them, and\nthat she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be. After a few days\nthey grew accustomed to him, and without restraint in his presence pursued\ntheir usual way of life, in which he took his part. He could talk about rural\neconomy with the count, fashions with the countess and Natásha, and about\nalbums and fancywork with Sónya. Sometimes the household both among\nthemselves and in his presence expressed their wonder at how it had all\nhappened, and at the evident omens there had been of it: Prince Andrew’s\ncoming to Otrádnoe and their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness\nbetween Natásha and Prince Andrew which her nurse had noticed on his\nfirst visit, and Andrew’s encounter with Nicholas in 1805, and many other\nincidents betokening that it had to be."}, {"page": 668, "text": "In the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always\naccompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting\ntogether everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and go\naway and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely spoke of\ntheir future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to speak of it.\nNatásha shared this as she did all his feelings, which she constantly divined.\nOnce she began questioning him about his son. Prince Andrew blushed, as\nhe often did now—Natásha particularly liked it in him—and said that his\nson would not live with them.\n“Why not?” asked Natásha in a frightened tone.\n“I cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...”\n“How I should have loved him!” said Natásha, immediately guessing his\nthought; “but I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding fault with\nus.”\nSometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask his\nadvice about Pétya’s education or Nicholas’ service. The old countess\nsighed as she looked at them; Sónya was always getting frightened lest she\nshould be in the way and tried to find excuses for leaving them alone, even\nwhen they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew spoke (he could tell a story\nvery well), Natásha listened to him with pride; when she spoke she noticed\nwith fear and joy that he gazed attentively and scrutinizingly at her. She\nasked herself in perplexity: “What does he look for in me? He is trying to\ndiscover something by looking at me! What if what he seeks in me is not\nthere?” Sometimes she fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic\nof her, and then she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince Andrew\nlaughed. He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned himself\nentirely to his laughter, and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him.\nNatásha would have been completely happy if the thought of the separation\nawaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her, just as the mere thought\nof it made him turn pale and cold.\nOn the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought with\nhim Pierre, who had not been to the Rostóvs’ once since the ball. Pierre\nseemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the countess, and\nNatásha sat down beside a little chess table with Sónya, thereby inviting\nPrince Andrew to come too. He did so.\n“You have known Bezúkhov a long time?” he asked. “Do you like him?”"}, {"page": 669, "text": "“Yes, he’s a dear, but very absurd.”\nAnd as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of his\nabsent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.\n“Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known him\nfrom childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie,” Prince Andrew\nsaid with sudden seriousness—“I am going away and heaven knows what\nmay happen. You may cease to... all right, I know I am not to say that. Only\nthis, then: whatever may happen to you when I am not here...”\n“What can happen?”\n“Whatever trouble may come,” Prince Andrew continued, “I beg you,\nMademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for\nadvice and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but he has\na heart of gold.”\nNeither her father, nor her mother, nor Sónya, nor Prince Andrew himself\ncould have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act on\nNatásha. Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day, dry-\neyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding what\nawaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking leave, he kissed her hand\nfor the last time. “Don’t go!” she said in a tone that made him wonder\nwhether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long\nafterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone; but for several days she sat\nin her room dry-eyed, taking no interest in anything and only saying now\nand then, “Oh, why did he go away?”\nBut a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around her, she\nrecovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became her old\nself again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy, as a child gets up\nafter a long illness with a changed expression of face."}, {"page": 670, "text": "CHAPTER XXV\nDuring that year after his son’s departure, Prince Nicholas Bolkónski’s\nhealth and temper became much worse. He grew still more irritable, and it\nwas Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits of\nunprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots so as to\ntorture her mentally as harshly as possible. Princess Mary had two passions\nand consequently two joys—her nephew, little Nicholas, and religion—and\nthese were the favorite subjects of the prince’s attacks and ridicule.\nWhatever was spoken of he would bring round to the superstitiousness of\nold maids, or the petting and spoiling of children. “You want to make\nhim”—little Nicholas—“into an old maid like yourself! A pity! Prince\nAndrew wants a son and not an old maid,” he would say. Or, turning to\nMademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in Princess Mary’s presence\nhow she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them.\nHe continually hurt Princess Mary’s feelings and tormented her, but it\ncost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to blame toward her, or could\nher father, whom she knew loved her in spite of it all, be unjust? And what\nis justice? The princess never thought of that proud word “justice.” All the\ncomplex laws of man centered for her in one clear and simple law—the law\nof love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who lovingly suffered for\nmankind though He Himself was God. What had she to do with the justice\nor injustice of other people? She had to endure and love, and that she did.\nDuring the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been\ngay, gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a\nlong time past. She felt that something had happened to him, but he said\nnothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a long talk with his\nfather about something, and Princess Mary noticed that before his departure\nthey were dissatisfied with one another.\nSoon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend\nJulie Karágina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls dream) of"}, {"page": 671, "text": "marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in mourning for her own\nbrother, killed in Turkey.\nSorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.\nYour loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a special\nprovidence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your excellent\nmother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone, can—I will not say\ncomfort us—but save us from despair. Religion alone can explain to us\nwhat without its help man cannot comprehend: why, for what cause, kind\nand noble beings able to find happiness in life—not merely harming no one\nbut necessary to the happiness of others—are called away to God, while\ncruel, useless, harmful persons, or such as are a burden to themselves and to\nothers, are left living. The first death I saw, and one I shall never forget—\nthat of my dear sister-in-law—left that impression on me. Just as you ask\ndestiny why your splendid brother had to die, so I asked why that angel\nLise, who not only never wronged anyone, but in whose soul there were\nnever any unkind thoughts, had to die. And what do you think, dear friend?\nFive years have passed since then, and already I, with my petty\nunderstanding, begin to see clearly why she had to die, and in what way that\ndeath was but an expression of the infinite goodness of the Creator, whose\nevery action, though generally incomprehensible to us, is but a\nmanifestation of His infinite love for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think,\nshe was too angelically innocent to have the strength to perform all a\nmother’s duties. As a young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could\nnot have been so as a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and\nparticularly Prince Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but\nprobably she will there receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not\nto speak of her alone, that early and terrible death has had the most\nbeneficent influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then,\nat the moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should\nthen have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear and\ncertain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince you of the\nGospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not a single hair\nof our heads will fall without His will. And His will is governed only by\ninfinite love for us, and so whatever befalls us is for our good.\nYou ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow.

As you\nknow, I am quite indifferent to politics, but from my father’s remarks and\nhis talks with Michael Ivánovich I know all that goes on in the world and\nespecially about the honors conferred on Buonaparte, who only at Bald\nHills in the whole world, it seems, is not accepted as a great man, still less\nas Emperor of France. And my father cannot stand this. It seems to me that\nit is chiefly because of his political views that my father is reluctant to\nspeak of going to Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result\nfrom his way of expressing his views regardless of anybody.

I do not think my brother will ever marry\nagain, and certainly not her; and this is why: first, I know that though he\nrarely speaks about the wife he has lost, the grief of that loss has gone too\ndeep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and our little\nangel a stepmother.

He wrote that he had never loved as he did\nnow and that only now did he understand and know what life was. He asked\nhis sister to forgive him for not having told her of his resolve when he had\nlast visited Bald Hills, though he had spoken of it to his father.

My father then insisted on a delay of a year\nand now already six months, half of that period, have passed, and my\nresolution is firmer than ever. If the doctors did not keep me here at the spas\nI should be back in Russia, but as it is I have to postpone my return for\nthree months. You know me and my relations with Father. I want nothing\nfrom him. I have been and always shall be independent; but to go against\nhis will and arouse his anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such\na short time, would destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him\nabout the same question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand\nhim the letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and\nwhether there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four\nmonths.”\nAfter long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave the letter\nto her father. The next day the old prince said to her quietly:\n“Write and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It won’t be long—I\nshall soon set him free.”\nThe princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her speak\nand, raising his voice more and more, cried:"}, {"page": 675, "text": "“Marry, marry, my boy!...

Only one thing, no more women are wanted in my house—let him\nmarry and live by himself. Perhaps you will go and live with him too?” he\nadded, turning to Princess Mary. “Go in heaven’s name! Go out into the\nfrost... the frost... the frost!”\nAfter this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter.\nBut repressed vexation at his son’s poor-spirited behavior found expression\nin his treatment of his daughter. To his former pretexts for irony a fresh one\nwas now added—allusions to stepmothers and amiabilities to Mademoiselle\nBourienne.\n“Why shouldn’t I marry her?” he asked his daughter. “She’ll make a\nsplendid princess!”\nAnd latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary noticed\nthat her father was really associating more and more with the\nFrenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his letter,\nbut comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the idea.\nLittle Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and religion were\nPrincess Mary’s joys and consolations; but besides that, since everyone\nmust have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the profoundest depths of her\nheart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation of\nher life. This comforting dream and hope were given her by God’s folk—the\nhalf-witted and other pilgrims who visited her without the prince’s\nknowledge. The longer she lived, the more experience and observation she\nhad of life, the greater was her wonder at the short-sightedness of men who\nseek enjoyment and happiness here on earth: toiling, suffering, struggling,\nand harming one another, to obtain that impossible, visionary, sinful\nhappiness. Prince Andrew had loved his wife, she died, but that was not\nenough: he wanted to bind his happiness to another woman. Her father\nobjected to this because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier\nmatch for Andrew.

To leave\nfamily, home, and all the cares of worldly welfare, in order without clinging\nto anything to wander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed\nname, doing no one any harm but praying for all—for those who drive one\naway as well as for those who protect one: higher than that life and truth\nthere is no life or truth!”\nThere was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called\nTheodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn\nheavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her. Once, when in a\nroom with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of her\nlife, the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of life\nsuddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to\nbecome a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary\nthought about this for a long time, and at last made up her mind that,\nstrange as it might seem, she must go on a pilgrimage. She disclosed this\nthought to no one but to her confessor, Father Akínfi, the monk, and he\napproved of her intention. Under guise of a present for the pilgrims,\nPrincess Mary prepared a pilgrim’s complete costume for herself: a coarse\nsmock, bast shoes, a rough coat, and a black kerchief. Often, approaching\nthe chest of drawers containing this secret treasure, Princess Mary paused,\nuncertain whether the time had not already come to put her project into\nexecution.\nOften, listening to the pilgrims’ tales, she was so stimulated by their\nsimple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaning, that\nseveral times she was on the point of abandoning everything and running\naway from home. In imagination she already pictured herself by\nTheodosia’s side, dressed in coarse rags, walking with a staff, a wallet on\nher back, along the dusty road, directing her wanderings from one saint’s\nshrine to another, free from envy, earthly love, or desire, and reaching at last\nthe place where there is no more sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and\nbliss."}, {"page": 677, "text": "“I shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to get\nused to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther.

Fallen man has\nretained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race not only\nbecause we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but because\nour moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease. An inner\nvoice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle. If man could find a state in\nwhich he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his duty, he would have\nfound one of the conditions of man’s primitive blessedness. And such a\nstate of obligatory and irreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class—\nthe military. The chief attraction of military service has consisted and will\nconsist in this compulsory and irreproachable idleness.\nNicholas Rostóv experienced this blissful condition to the full when, after\n1807, he continued to serve in the Pávlograd regiment, in which he already\ncommanded the squadron he had taken over from Denísov.\nRostóv had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow\nacquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was liked\nand respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was well\ncontented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in letters from home more\nfrequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling into\ngreater and greater disorder, and that it was time for him to come back to\ngladden and comfort his old parents.\nReading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to take him\naway from surroundings in which, protected from all the entanglements of\nlife, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt that sooner or later he\nwould have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with its embarrassments and\naffairs to be straightened out, its accounts with stewards, quarrels, and\nintrigues, its ties, society, and with Sónya’s love and his promise to her. It\nwas all dreadfully difficult and complicated; and he replied to his mother in\ncold, formal letters in French, beginning: “My dear Mamma,” and ending:\n“Your obedient son,” which said nothing of when he would return. In 1810"}, {"page": 681, "text": "he received letters from his parents, in which they told him of Natásha’s\nengagement to Bolkónski, and that the wedding would be in a year’s time\nbecause the old prince made difficulties. This letter grieved and mortified\nNicholas. In the first place he was sorry that Natásha, for whom he cared\nmore than for anyone else in the family, should be lost to the home; and\nsecondly, from his hussar point of view, he regretted not to have been there\nto show that fellow Bolkónski that connection with him was no such great\nhonor after all, and that if he loved Natásha he might dispense with\npermission from his dotard father. For a moment he hesitated whether he\nshould not apply for leave in order to see Natásha before she was married,\nbut then came the maneuvers, and considerations about Sónya and about the\nconfusion of their affairs, and Nicholas again put it off. But in the spring of\nthat year, he received a letter from his mother, written without his father’s\nknowledge, and that letter persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did\nnot come and take matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by\nauction and they would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and\ntrusted Mítenka so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took\nadvantage of him and things were going from bad to worse. “For God’s\nsake, I implore you, come at once if you do not wish to make me and the\nwhole family wretched,” wrote the countess.\nThis letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a matter-of-\nfact man which showed him what he ought to do.\nThe right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate to go\nhome on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his after-dinner\nnap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious gray stallion that\nhad not been ridden for a long time, and when he returned with the horse all\nin a lather, he informed Lavrúshka (Denísov’s servant who had remained\nwith him) and his comrades who turned up in the evening that he was\napplying for leave and was going home. Difficult and strange as it was for\nhim to reflect that he would go away without having heard from the staff—\nand this interested him extremely—whether he was promoted to a captaincy\nor would receive the Order of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it\nwas to think that he would go away without having sold his three roans to\nthe Polish Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses Rostóv\nhad betted he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it\nseemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish\nMademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had given one"}, {"page": 682, "text": "in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would take place\nwithout him—he knew he must go away from this good, bright world to\nsomewhere where everything was stupid and confused. A week later he\nobtained his leave. His hussar comrades—not only those of his own\nregiment, but the whole brigade—gave Rostóv a dinner to which the\nsubscription was fifteen rubles a head, and at which there were two bands\nand two choirs of singers. Rostóv danced the Trepák with Major Básov; the\ntipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped Rostóv; the soldiers of the\nthird squadron tossed him too, and shouted “hurrah!” and then they put him\nin his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first post station.\nDuring the first half of the journey—from Kremenchúg to Kiev—all\nRostóv’s thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with the\nsquadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget his\nthree roans and Dozhoyvéyko, his quartermaster, and to wonder anxiously\nhow things would be at Otrádnoe and what he would find there. Thoughts\nof home grew stronger the nearer he approached it—far stronger, as though\nthis feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of attraction is\nin inverse proportion to the square of the distance. At the last post station\nbefore Otrádnoe he gave the driver a three-ruble tip, and on arriving he ran\nbreathlessly, like a boy, up the steps of his home.\nAfter the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied\nexpectation—the feeling that “everything is just the same, so why did I\nhurry?”—Nicholas began to settle down in his old home world. His father\nand mother were much the same, only a little older. What was new in them\nwas a certain uneasiness and occasional discord, which there used not to be,\nand which, as Nicholas soon found out, was due to the bad state of their\naffairs. Sónya was nearly twenty; she had stopped growing prettier and\npromised nothing more than she was already, but that was enough. She\nexhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas returned, and the\nfaithful, unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him. Pétya\nand Natásha surprised Nicholas most. Pétya was a big handsome boy of\nthirteen, merry, witty, and mischievous, with a voice that was already\nbreaking. As for Natásha, for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed\nwhenever he looked at her.\n“You’re not the same at all,” he said.\n“How? Am I uglier?”"}, {"page": 683, "text": "“On the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!” he whispered to her.\n“Yes, yes, yes!” cried Natásha, joyfully.\nShe told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit to\nOtrádnoe and showed him his last letter.\n“Well, are you glad?” Natásha asked. “I am so tranquil and happy now.”\n“Very glad,” answered Nicholas. “He is an excellent fellow.... And are\nyou very much in love?”\n“How shall I put it?” replied Natásha. “I was in love with Borís, with my\nteacher, and with Denísov, but this is quite different. I feel at peace and\nsettled. I know that no better man than he exists, and I am calm and\ncontented now. Not at all as before.”\nNicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage\nfor a year; but Natásha attacked her brother with exasperation, proving to\nhim that it could not be otherwise, and that it would be a bad thing to enter\na family against the father’s will, and that she herself wished it so.\n“You don’t at all understand,” she said.\nNicholas was silent and agreed with her.\nHer brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not seem at all\nlike a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband. She was even-\ntempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old. This amazed Nicholas\nand even made him regard Bolkónski’s courtship skeptically. He could not\nbelieve that her fate was sealed, especially as he had not seen her with\nPrince Andrew. It always seemed to him that there was something not quite\nright about this intended marriage.\n“Why this delay? Why no betrothal?” he thought. Once, when he had\ntouched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his surprise and\nsomewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her soul she too had doubts\nabout this marriage.\n“You see he writes,” said she, showing her son a letter of Prince\nAndrew’s, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a\ndaughter’s future married happiness, “he writes that he won’t come before\nDecember. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His health is very\ndelicate. Don’t tell Natásha.

To throw off this burden\nas quickly as possible, on the third day after his arrival he went, angry and\nscowling and without answering questions as to where he was going, to\nMítenka’s lodge and demanded an account of everything. But what an\naccount of everything might be Nicholas knew even less than the frightened\nand bewildered Mítenka. The conversation and the examination of the\naccounts with Mítenka did not last long. The village elder, a peasant\ndelegate, and the village clerk, who were waiting in the passage, heard with\nfear and delight first the young count’s voice roaring and snapping and\nrising louder and louder, and then words of abuse, dreadful words,\nejaculated one after the other.\n“Robber!... Ungrateful wretch!... I’ll hack the dog to pieces! I’m not my\nfather!... Robbing us!...” and so on.\nThen with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red in\nthe face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mítenka out by the scruff of the\nneck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility at\nconvenient moments between the words, shouting, “Be off! Never let me\nsee your face here again, you villain!”\nMítenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the\nshrubbery.

She went several times to his door on tiptoe and\nlistened, as he lighted one pipe after another.\nNext day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed\nsmile, said to him:\n“But you know, my dear boy, it’s a pity you got excited! Mítenka has told\nme all about it.”\n“I knew,” thought Nicholas, “that I should never understand anything in\nthis crazy world.”\n“You were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they were\ncarried forward—and you did not look at the other page.”\n“Papa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is!

But once the countess called her son and informed him that\nshe had a promissory note from Anna Mikháylovna for two thousand\nrubles, and asked him what he thought of doing with it.\n“This,” answered Nicholas. “You say it rests with me. Well, I don’t like\nAnna Mikháylovna and I don’t like Borís, but they were our friends and\npoor. Well then, this!” and he tore up the note, and by so doing caused the\nold countess to weep tears of joy.

The verdure had thickened and its bright\ngreen stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye trodden\ndown by the cattle, and against the pale-yellow stubble of the spring\nbuckwheat. The wooded ravines and the copses, which at the end of August\nhad still been green islands amid black fields and stubble, had become\ngolden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The hares had\nalready half changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were beginning to\nscatter, and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was the best time of\nthe year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young sportsman Rostóv\nhad not merely reached hard winter condition, but were so jaded that at a\nmeeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a three days’ rest and\nthen, on the sixteenth of September, to go on a distant expedition, starting\nfrom the oak grove where there was an undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.\nAll that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the air was\nsharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw. On\nthe fifteenth, when young Rostóv, in his dressing gown, looked out of the\nwindow, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting: it was as if\nthe sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind. The only\nmotion in the air was that of the dripping, microscopic particles of drizzling\nmist. The bare twigs in the garden were hung with transparent drops which\nfell on the freshly fallen leaves. The earth in the kitchen garden looked wet\nand black and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance merged into\nthe dull, moist veil of mist. Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy\nporch. There was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog. Mílka, a black-\nspotted, broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes, got up on seeing\nher master, stretched her hind legs, lay down like a hare, and then suddenly\njumped up and licked him right on his nose and mustache.

He doffed his Circassian cap to his master and\nlooked at him scornfully. This scorn was not offensive to his master.\nNicholas knew that this Daniel, disdainful of everybody and who\nconsidered himself above them, was all the same his serf and huntsman.\n“Daniel!” Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the weather, the\nhounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away by that irresistible\npassion for sport which makes a man forget all his previous resolutions, as a\nlover forgets in the presence of his mistress.\n“What orders, your excellency?” said the huntsman in his deep bass, deep\nas a proto-deacon’s and hoarse with hallooing—and two flashing black eyes\ngazed from under his brows at his master, who was silent. “Can you resist\nit?” those eyes seemed to be asking.\n“It’s a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?” asked Nicholas,\nscratching Mílka behind the ears.\nDaniel did not answer, but winked instead.\n“I sent Uvárka at dawn to listen,” his bass boomed out after a minute’s\npause. “He says she’s moved them into the Otrádnoe enclosure. They were\nhowling there.” (This meant that the she-wolf, about whom they both knew,\nhad moved with her cubs to the Otrádnoe copse, a small place a mile and a\nhalf from the house.)\n“We ought to go, don’t you think so?” said Nicholas. “Come to me with\nUvárka.”\n“As you please.”\n“Then put off feeding them.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nFive minutes later Daniel and Uvárka were standing in Nicholas’ big\nstudy.

He was the buffoon, who went by a woman’s name, Nastásya\nIvánovna.\n“Well, Nastásya Ivánovna!” whispered the count, winking at him. “If you\nscare away the beast, Daniel’ll give it you!”\n“I know a thing or two myself!” said Nastásya Ivánovna.\n“Hush!” whispered the count and turned to Simon. “Have you seen the\nyoung countess?” he asked. “Where is she?”\n“With young Count Peter, by the Zhárov rank grass,” answered Simon,\nsmiling. “Though she’s a lady, she’s very fond of hunting.”\n“And you’re surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?” said the count.\n“She’s as good as many a man!”\n“Of course!

After the cry of the hounds came\nthe deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel’s hunting horn; the pack joined\nthe first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry, with that peculiar\nlift in the note that indicates that they are after a wolf. The whippers-in no\nlonger set on the hounds, but changed to the cry of ulyulyu, and above the\nothers rose Daniel’s voice, now a deep bass, now piercingly shrill. His voice\nseemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into the open\nfield.\nAfter listening a few moments in silence, the count and his attendant\nconvinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs: the\nsound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue, began to die away in the\ndistance, the other pack rushed by the wood past the count, and it was with\nthis that Daniel’s voice was heard calling ulyulyu. The sounds of both packs\nmingled and broke apart again, but both were becoming more distant.\nSimon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had\nentangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in his hand,\nopened it and took a pinch. “Back!” cried Simon to a borzoi that was\npushing forward out of the wood. The count started and dropped the\nsnuffbox. Nastásya Ivánovna dismounted to pick it up. The count and\nSimon were looking at him.\nThen, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenly\napproached, as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were just in\nfront of them.\nThe count turned and saw on his right Mítka staring at him with eyes\nstarting out of his head, raising his cap and pointing before him to the other\nside.\n“Look out!” he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that he had long\nfretted to utter that word, and letting the borzois slip he galloped toward the\ncount.\nThe count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a\nwolf which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet lope\nfarther to the left to the very place where they were standing.

The count, like a punished schoolboy, looked\nround, trying by a smile to win Simon’s sympathy for his plight. But Simon\nwas no longer there.

He knew that young and old wolves were there, that the hounds had\nseparated into two packs, that somewhere a wolf was being chased, and that\nsomething had gone wrong. He expected the wolf to come his way any\nmoment. He made thousands of different conjectures as to where and from\nwhat side the beast would come and how he would set upon it. Hope\nalternated with despair. Several times he addressed a prayer to God that the\nwolf should come his way. He prayed with that passionate and shamefaced\nfeeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement arising from\ntrivial causes. “What would it be to Thee to do this for me?” he said to God.\n“I know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to ask this of Thee, but for God’s\nsake do let the old wolf come my way and let Karáy spring at it—in sight of\n‘Uncle’ who is watching from over there—and seize it by the throat in a\ndeath grip!” A thousand times during that half-hour Rostóv cast eager and\nrestless glances over the edge of the wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising\nabove the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its water-worn side and\n“Uncle’s” cap just visible above the bush on his right.\n“No, I shan’t have such luck,” thought Rostóv, “yet what wouldn’t it be\nworth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in war, I am always\nunlucky.” Memories of Austerlitz and of Dólokhov flashed rapidly and\nclearly through his mind. “Only once in my life to get an old wolf, I want\nonly that!” thought he, straining eyes and ears and looking to the left and\nthen to the right and listening to the slightest variation of note in the cries of\nthe dogs.\nAgain he looked to the right and saw something running toward him\nacross the deserted field. “No, it can’t be!” thought Rostóv, taking a deep"}, {"page": 698, "text": "breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for. The\nheight of happiness was reached—and so simply, without warning, or noise,\nor display, that Rostóv could not believe his eyes and remained in doubt for\nover a second. The wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over a gully that\nlay in her path. She was an old animal with a gray back and big reddish\nbelly. She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that no one saw her.\nRostóv, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois. They stood or lay\nnot seeing the wolf or understanding the situation. Old Karáy had turned his\nhead and was angrily searching for fleas, baring his yellow teeth and\nsnapping at his hind legs.\n“Ulyulyulyu!” whispered Rostóv, pouting his lips. The borzois jumped\nup, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears. Karáy finished\nscratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got up with quivering tail\nfrom which tufts of matted hair hung down.\n“Shall I loose them or not?” Nicholas asked himself as the wolf\napproached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolf’s whole\nphysiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never\nseen before—human eyes fixed upon her—and turning her head a little\ntoward Rostóv, she paused.\n“Back or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...” the wolf seemed to say to\nherself, and she moved forward without again looking round and with a\nquiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.\n“Ulyulyu!” cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own accord\nhis good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies to head off\nthe wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still. Nicholas did not\nhear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping, nor see the borzois, nor the\nground over which he went: he saw only the wolf, who, increasing her\nspeed, bounded on in the same direction along the hollow. The first to come\ninto view was Mílka, with her black markings and powerful quarters,\ngaining upon the wolf. Nearer and nearer... now she was ahead of it; but the\nwolf turned its head to face her, and instead of putting on speed as she\nusually did Mílka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs.\n“Ulyulyulyulyu!” shouted Nicholas.\nThe reddish Lyubím rushed forward from behind Mílka, sprang\nimpetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but immediately\njumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her teeth, and again"}, {"page": 699, "text": "rose and bounded forward, followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all\nthe borzois, who did not get any closer to her.\n“She’ll get away! No, it’s impossible!” thought Nicholas, still shouting\nwith a hoarse voice.\n“Karáy, ulyulyu!...” he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi who was\nnow his only hope. Karáy, with all the strength age had left him, stretched\nhimself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped heavily aside to\nintercept it. But the quickness of the wolf’s lope and the borzoi’s slower\npace made it plain that Karáy had miscalculated. Nicholas could already see\nnot far in front of him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape\nshould she reach it. But, coming toward him, he saw hounds and a\nhuntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf. There was still hope. A\nlong, yellowish young borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another\nleash, rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her\nover. But the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have\nexpected and, gnashing her teeth, flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with\na piercing yelp, fell with its head on the ground, bleeding from a gash in its\nside.\n“Karáy? Old fellow!...” wailed Nicholas.\nThanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf’s path, the old\ndog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of it.\nAs if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her eyes on Karáy, tucked her tail\nyet further between her legs, and increased her speed. But here Nicholas\nonly saw that something happened to Karáy—the borzoi was suddenly on\nthe wolf, and they rolled together down into a gully just in front of them.\nThat instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with the\ndogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and outstretched\nhind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears laid back (Karáy\nwas pinning her by the throat), was the happiest moment of his life. With\nhis hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to dismount and stab the wolf,\nwhen she suddenly thrust her head up from among that mass of dogs, and\nthen her forepaws were on the edge of the gully. She clicked her teeth\n(Karáy no longer had her by the throat), leaped with a movement of her\nhind legs out of the gully, and having disengaged herself from the dogs,\nwith tail tucked in again, went forward. Karáy, his hair bristling, and\nprobably bruised or wounded, climbed with difficulty out of the gully."}, {"page": 700, "text": "“Oh my God! Why?” Nicholas cried in despair.\n“Uncle’s” huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolf’s\npath and his borzois once more stopped the animal’s advance. She was\nagain hemmed in.\nNicholas and his attendant, with “Uncle” and his huntsman, were all\nriding round the wolf, crying “ulyulyu!” shouting and preparing to\ndismount each moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward\nagain every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she\nwould be safe.\nAlready, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the ulyulyuing,\nhad rushed out from the wood. He saw Karáy seize the wolf, and checked\nhis horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he saw that the\nhorsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for\nsafety, Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf but straight toward\nthe wood, just as Karáy had run to cut the animal off. As a result of this, he\ngalloped up to the wolf just when she had been stopped a second time by\n“Uncle’s” borzois.\nDaniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand and\nthrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if it were\na flail.\nNicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut, breathing\nheavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel\nlying on the wolf’s back among the dogs, trying to seize her by the ears. It\nwas evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf herself that all was\nnow over. The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and tried to rise, but the\nborzois stuck to her. Daniel rose a little, took a step, and with his whole\nweight, as if lying down to rest, fell on the wolf, seizing her by the ears.\nNicholas was about to stab her, but Daniel whispered, “Don’t! We’ll gag\nher!” and, changing his position, set his foot on the wolf’s neck. A stick was\nthrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a leash, as if bridled, her\nlegs were bound together, and Daniel rolled her over once or twice from\nside to side.\nWith happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a shying\nand snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her, took her to\nthe place where they were all to meet.

Old Count Rostóv also rode up and touched the wolf.\n“Oh, what a formidable one!” said he. “A formidable one, eh?” he asked\nDaniel, who was standing near.\n“Yes, your excellency,” answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.\nThe count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with\nDaniel.\n“Ah, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!” said the count.\nFor sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable smile."}, {"page": 702, "text": "CHAPTER VI\nThe old count went home, and Natásha and Pétya promised to return very\nsoon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. At midday they put the\nhounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees. Nicholas standing\nin a fallow field could see all his whips.\nFacing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood alone\nin a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been loosed\nbefore Nicholas heard one he knew, Voltórn, giving tongue at intervals;\nother hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving tongue. A\nmoment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been\nfound, and the whole pack, joining together, rushed along the ravine toward\nthe ryefield and away from Nicholas.\nHe saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the ravine,\nhe even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself at any\nmoment on the ryefield opposite.\nThe huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois, and\nNicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard\nacross the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew close to the\nfox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper curves,\ntrailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in followed\nby a black one, and everything was in confusion; the borzois formed a star-\nshaped figure, scarcely swaying their bodies and with tails turned away\nfrom the center of the group. Two huntsmen galloped up to the dogs; one in\na red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat.\n“What’s this?” thought Nicholas. “Where’s that huntsman from? He is\nnot ‘Uncle’s’ man.”\nThe huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without strapping\nit to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high saddles, stood near them\nand there too the dogs were lying. The huntsmen waved their arms and did"}, {"page": 703, "text": "something to the fox. Then from that spot came the sound of a horn, with\nthe signal agreed on in case of a fight.\n“That’s Ilágin’s huntsman having a row with our Iván,” said Nicholas’\ngroom.\nNicholas sent the man to call Natásha and Pétya to him, and rode at a\nfootpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together.\nSeveral of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on.\nNicholas dismounted, and with Natásha and Pétya, who had ridden up,\nstopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would end. Out of\nthe bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his\nyoung master, with the fox tied to his crupper. While still at a distance he\ntook off his cap and tried to speak respectfully, but he was pale and\nbreathless and his face was angry. One of his eyes was black, but he\nprobably was not even aware of it.\n“What has happened?” asked Nicholas.\n“A likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And it was my gray\nbitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He snatches at the fox! I gave him\none with the fox. Here it is on my saddle! Do you want a taste of this?...”\nsaid the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and probably imagining himself\nstill speaking to his foe.\nNicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and Pétya to\nwait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy’s, Ilágin’s, hunting party\nwas.\nThe victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there, surrounded\nby inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.\nThe facts were that Ilágin, with whom the Rostóvs had a quarrel and\nwere at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the Rostóvs, and\nhad now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very woods the Rostóvs were\nhunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased.\nNicholas, though he had never seen Ilágin, with his usual absence of\nmoderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports of his\narbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe. He rode in\nangry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully prepared to\ntake the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his enemy."}, {"page": 704, "text": "Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in a\nbeaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse,\naccompanied by two hunt servants.\nInstead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Ilágin a stately and courteous\ngentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young count’s\nacquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, Ilágin raised his beaver cap\nand said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man\npunished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone else’s\nborzois. He hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invited\nhim to draw his covert.\nNatásha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, had\nfollowed him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging friendly\ngreetings, she rode up to them. Ilágin lifted his beaver cap still higher to\nNatásha and said, with a pleasant smile, that the young countess resembled\nDiana in her passion for the chase as well as in her beauty, of which he had\nheard much.\nTo expiate his huntsman’s offense, Ilágin pressed the Rostóvs to come to\nan upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself and\nwhich, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas agreed, and the hunt, now\ndoubled, moved on.\nThe way to Iligin’s upland was across the fields. The hunt servants fell\ninto line. The masters rode together. “Uncle,” Rostóv, and Ilágin kept\nstealthily glancing at one another’s dogs, trying not to be observed by their\ncompanions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzois.\nRostóv was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred, red-\nspotted bitch on Ilágin’s leash, slender but with muscles like steel, a delicate\nmuzzle, and prominent black eyes. He had heard of the swiftness of Ilágin’s\nborzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own Mílka.\nIn the middle of a sober conversation begun by Ilágin about the year’s\nharvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.\n“A fine little bitch, that!” said he in a careless tone. “Is she swift?”\n“That one? Yes, she’s a good dog, gets what she’s after,” answered Ilágin\nindifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erzá, for which, a year before, he had\ngiven a neighbor three families of house serfs. “So in your parts, too, the\nharvest is nothing to boast of, Count?” he went on, continuing the"}, {"page": 705, "text": "conversation they had begun.

For myself, I can tell you, Count, I enjoy\nriding in company such as this... what could be better?” (he again raised his\ncap to Natásha) “but as for counting skins and what one takes, I don’t care\nabout that.”\n“Of course not!”\n“Or being upset because someone else’s borzoi and not mine catches\nsomething. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not so, Count?\nFor I consider that...”\n“A-tu!” came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in, who\nhad halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip aloft, and\nagain repeated his long-drawn cry, “A-tu!” (This call and the uplifted whip\nmeant that he saw a sitting hare.)\n“Ah, he has found one, I think,” said Ilágin carelessly. “Yes, we must ride\nup.... Shall we both course it?” answered Nicholas, seeing in Erzá and\n“Uncle’s” red Rugáy two rivals he had never yet had a chance of pitting\nagainst his own borzois. “And suppose they outdo my Mílka at once!” he\nthought as he rode with “Uncle” and Ilágin toward the hare.\n“A full-grown one?” asked Ilágin as he approached the whip who had\nsighted the hare—and not without agitation he looked round and whistled to\nErzá.\n“And you, Michael Nikanórovich?” he said, addressing “Uncle.”\nThe latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.\n“How can I join in? Why, you’ve given a village for each of your\nborzois! That’s it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours against\none another, you two, and I’ll look on!”"}, {"page": 706, "text": "“Rugáy, hey, hey!” he shouted. “Rugáyushka!” he added, involuntarily\nby this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this\nred borzoi. Natásha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and her\nbrother were trying to conceal, and was herself excited by it.\nThe huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the\ngentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were far off on the\nhorizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but not the gentlefolk,\nalso moved away. All were moving slowly and sedately.\n“How is it pointing?” asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces toward the\nwhip who had sighted the hare.\nBut before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming next\nmorning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash rushed\ndownhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the borzois that were\nnot on leash darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt, who had\nbeen moving slowly, shouted, “Stop!” calling in the hounds, while the\nborzoi whips, with a cry of “A-tu!” galloped across the field setting the\nborzois on the hare. The tranquil Ilágin, Nicholas, Natásha, and “Uncle”\nflew, reckless of where and how they went, seeing only the borzois and the\nhare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant of the chase. The hare\nthey had started was a strong and swift one. When he jumped up he did not\nrun at once, but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling that\nresounded from all sides at once. He took a dozen bounds, not very quickly,\nletting the borzois gain on him, and, finally having chosen his direction and\nrealized his danger, laid back his ears and rushed off headlong. He had been\nlying in the stubble, but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the\nground was soft. The two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him,\nhaving been the nearest, were the first to see and pursue him, but they had\nnot gone far before Ilágin’s red-spotted Erzá passed them, got within a\nlength, flew at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut, and,\nthinking she had seized him, rolled over like a ball. The hare arched his\nback and bounded off yet more swiftly. From behind Erzá rushed the broad-\nhaunched, black-spotted Mílka and began rapidly gaining on the hare.\n“Miláshka, dear!” rose Nicholas’ triumphant cry.

Again Erzá and Mílka were abreast, running like a pair of\ncarriage horses, and began to overtake the hare, but it was easier for the\nhare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so quickly.\n“Rugáy, Rugáyushka! That’s it, come on!” came a third voice just then,\nand “Uncle’s” red borzoi, straining and curving its back, caught up with the\ntwo foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless of the terrible strain,\nput on speed close to the hare, knocked it off the balk onto the ryefield,\nagain put on speed still more viciously, sinking to his knees in the muddy\nfield, and all one could see was how, muddying his back, he rolled over\nwith the hare. A ring of borzois surrounded him. A moment later everyone\nhad drawn up round the crowd of dogs. Only the delighted “Uncle”\ndismounted, and cut off a pad, shaking the hare for the blood to drip off,\nand anxiously glancing round with restless eyes while his arms and legs\ntwitched. He spoke without himself knowing whom to or what about.\n“That’s it, come on! That’s a dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the\nthousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble borzois. That’s it, come on!” said\nhe, panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone,\nas if they were all his enemies and had insulted him, and only now had he at\nlast succeeded in justifying himself. “There are your thousand-ruble ones....\nThat’s it, come on!...”\n“Rugáy, here’s a pad for you!” he said, throwing down the hare’s muddy\npad. “You’ve deserved it, that’s it, come on!”\n“She’d tired herself out, she’d run it down three times by herself,” said\nNicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he were\nheard or not.\n“But what is there in running across it like that?” said Ilágin’s groom.\n“Once she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take it,”\nIlágin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop and his\nexcitement.

The others all followed, dispirited and shamefaced, and\nonly much later were they able to regain their former affectation of\nindifference. For a long time they continued to look at red Rugáy who, his\narched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash, walked\nalong just behind “Uncle’s” horse with the serene air of a conqueror.\n“Well, I am like any other dog as long as it’s not a question of coursing.\nBut when it is, then look out!” his appearance seemed to Nicholas to be\nsaying.\nWhen, much later, “Uncle” rode up to Nicholas and began talking to him,\nhe felt flattered that, after what had happened, “Uncle” deigned to speak to\nhim."}, {"page": 709, "text": "CHAPTER VII\nToward evening Ilágin took leave of Nicholas, who found that they were\nso far from home that he accepted “Uncle’s” offer that the hunting party\nshould spend the night in his little village of Mikháylovna.\n“And if you put up at my house that will be better still. That’s it, come\non!” said “Uncle.” “You see it’s damp weather, and you could rest, and the\nlittle countess could be driven home in a trap.”\n“Uncle’s” offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to Otrádnoe for a\ntrap, while Nicholas rode with Natásha and Pétya to “Uncle’s” house.\nSome five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the front\nporch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and young, as well\nas children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at the hunters\nwho were arriving. The presence of Natásha—a woman, a lady, and on\nhorseback—raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that many of\nthem came up to her, stared her in the face, and unabashed by her presence\nmade remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on show and not\na human being able to hear or understand what was said about her.\n“Arínka!

The house, with\nits bare, unplastered log walls, was not overclean—it did not seem that\nthose living in it aimed at keeping it spotless—but neither was it noticeably\nneglected. In the entry there was a smell of fresh apples, and wolf and fox\nskins hung about.\n“Uncle” led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a\nfolding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a round\nbirchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room where there\nwas a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of Suvórov, of the host’s\nfather and mother, and of himself in military uniform. The study smelt\nstrongly of tobacco and dogs. “Uncle” asked his visitors to sit down and\nmake themselves at home, and then went out of the room. Rugáy, his back\nstill muddy, came into the room and lay down on the sofa, cleaning himself\nwith his tongue and teeth. Leading from the study was a passage in which a\npartition with ragged curtains could be seen. From behind this came\nwomen’s laughter and whispers. Natásha, Nicholas, and Pétya took off their\nwraps and sat down on the sofa. Pétya, leaning on his elbow, fell asleep at\nonce. Natásha and Nicholas were silent. Their faces glowed, they were\nhungry and very cheerful. They looked at one another (now that the hunt\nwas over and they were in the house, Nicholas no longer considered it\nnecessary to show his manly superiority over his sister), Natásha gave him a\nwink, and neither refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing\nlaughter even before they had a pretext ready to account for it.\nAfter a while “Uncle” came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and\nsmall top boots. And Natásha felt that this costume, the very one she had\nregarded with surprise and amusement at Otrádnoe, was just the right thing\nand not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat. “Uncle” too was in\nhigh spirits and far from being offended by the brother’s and sister’s\nlaughter (it could never enter his head that they might be laughing at his\nway of life) he himself joined in the merriment.\n“That’s right, young countess, that’s it, come on!

In spite of her exceptional stoutness, which caused her to\nprotrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head, this woman (who\nwas “Uncle’s” housekeeper) trod very lightly. She went to the table, set\ndown the tray, and with her plump white hands deftly took from it the\nbottles and various hors d’oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the\ntable. When she had finished, she stepped aside and stopped at the door\nwith a smile on her face. “Here I am. I am she! Now do you understand\n‘Uncle’?” her expression said to Rostóv. How could one help\nunderstanding? Not only Nicholas, but even Natásha understood the\nmeaning of his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that slightly\npuckered his lips when Anísya Fëdorovna entered. On the tray was a bottle\nof herb wine, different kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, rye cakes made\nwith buttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and sparkling mead, apples,\nnuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey sweets. Afterwards she brought a\nfreshly roasted chicken, ham, preserves made with honey, and preserves\nmade with sugar.\nAll this was the fruit of Anísya Fëdorovna’s housekeeping, gathered and\nprepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had a smack of Anísya\nFëdorovna herself: a savor of juiciness, cleanliness, whiteness, and pleasant\nsmiles.\n“Take this, little Lady-Countess!” she kept saying, as she offered Natásha\nfirst one thing and then another.\nNatásha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such\nbuttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets, or such a\nchicken anywhere. Anísya Fëdorovna left the room.\nAfter supper, over their cherry brandy, Rostóv and “Uncle” talked of past\nand future hunts, of Rugáy and Ilágin’s dogs, while Natásha sat upright on\nthe sofa and listened with sparkling eyes.

Death will come. That’s\nit, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?”\n“Uncle’s” face was very significant and even handsome as he said this.\nInvoluntarily Rostóv recalled all the good he had heard about him from his\nfather and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province “Uncle” had the\nreputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks. They\ncalled him in to decide family disputes, chose him as executor, confided\nsecrets to him, elected him to be a justice and to other posts; but he always\npersistently refused public appointments, passing the autumn and spring in\nthe fields on his bay gelding, sitting at home in winter, and lying in his\novergrown garden in summer.\n“Why don’t you enter the service, Uncle?”\n“I did once, but gave it up.

Open the door, there!” he\nshouted. “Why have you shut it?”\nThe door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen’s room, as they\ncalled the room for the hunt servants.\nThere was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the door\ninto the huntsmen’s room, from which came the clear sounds of a balaláyka\non which someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was playing.\nNatásha had been listening to those strains for some time and now went out\ninto the passage to hear better.\n“That’s Mítka, my coachman.... I have got him a good balaláyka. I’m\nfond of it,” said “Uncle.”\nIt was the custom for Mítka to play the balaláyka in the huntsmen’s room\nwhen “Uncle” returned from the chase. “Uncle” was fond of such music.\n“How good! Really very good!” said Nicholas with some unintentional\nsuperciliousness, as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him very\nmuch.\n“Very good?” said Natásha reproachfully, noticing her brother’s tone.\n“Not ‘very good’—it’s simply delicious!”"}, {"page": 713, "text": "Just as “Uncle’s” pickled mushrooms, honey, and cherry brandy had\nseemed to her the best in the world, so also that song, at that moment,\nseemed to her the acme of musical delight.\n“More, please, more!” cried Natásha at the door as soon as the balaláyka\nceased. Mítka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming the balaláyka\nto the air of My Lady, with trills and variations. “Uncle” sat listening,\nslightly smiling, with his head on one side. The air was repeated a hundred\ntimes. The balaláyka was retuned several times and the same notes were\nthrummed again, but the listeners did not grow weary of it and wished to\nhear it again and again. Anísya Fëdorovna came in and leaned her portly\nperson against the doorpost.\n“You like listening?” she said to Natásha, with a smile extremely like\n“Uncle’s.” “That’s a good player of ours,” she added.\n“He doesn’t play that part right!” said “Uncle” suddenly, with an\nenergetic gesture. “Here he ought to burst out—that’s it, come on!—ought\nto burst out.”\n“Do you play then?” asked Natásha.\n“Uncle” did not answer, but smiled.\n“Anísya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right. I haven’t\ntouched it for a long time. That’s it—come on! I’ve given it up.”\nAnísya Fëdorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her errand\nand brought back the guitar.\nWithout looking at anyone, “Uncle” blew the dust off it and, tapping the\ncase with his bony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled himself in his\narmchair. He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard, arching his left\nelbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a wink at Anísya\nFëdorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous, and then quietly,\nsmoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow time, not My Lady,\nbut the well-known song: Came a maiden down the street. The tune, played\nwith precision and in exact time, began to thrill in the hearts of Nicholas\nand Natásha, arousing in them the same kind of sober mirth as radiated\nfrom Anísya Fëdorovna’s whole being.

This match was with Julie Karágina, the daughter of excellent\nand virtuous parents, a girl the Rostóvs had known from childhood, and\nwho had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her\nbrothers.\nThe countess had written direct to Julie’s mother in Moscow suggesting a\nmarriage between their children and had received a favorable answer from\nher.

Natásha\ncame into the room, went up to Sónya, glanced at what she was doing, and\nthen went up to her mother and stood without speaking.\n“Why are you wandering about like an outcast?” asked her mother.\n“What do you want?”\n“Him... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!” said Natásha, with\nglittering eyes and no sign of a smile.\nThe countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.\n“Don’t look at me, Mamma! Don’t look; I shall cry directly.”\n“Sit down with me a little,” said the countess.\n“Mamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?”\nHer voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned quickly to\nhide them and left the room.\nShe passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and then\nwent into the maids’ room. There an old maidservant was grumbling at a"}, {"page": 722, "text": "young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold from the\nserfs’ quarters.\n“Stop playing—there’s a time for everything,” said the old woman.\n“Let her alone, Kondrátevna,” said Natásha. “Go, Mavrúshka, go.”\nHaving released Mavrúshka, Natásha crossed the dancing hall and went\nto the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing\ncards. They broke off and rose as she entered.\n“What can I do with them?” thought Natásha.\n“Oh, Nikíta, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the yard and\nfetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some oats.”\n“Just a few oats?” said Misha, cheerfully and readily.\n“Go, go quickly,” the old man urged him.\n“And you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.”\nOn her way past the butler’s pantry she told them to set a samovar,\nthough it was not at all the time for tea.\nFóka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house. Natásha\nliked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order and asked whether\nthe samovar was really wanted.\n“Oh dear, what a young lady!” said Fóka, pretending to frown at Natásha.\nNo one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as\nNatásha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to send them\non some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of them would get\nangry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no one’s orders so readily as\nthey did hers. “What can I do, where can I go?” thought she, as she went\nslowly along the passage.\n“Nastásya Ivánovna, what sort of children shall I have?” she asked the\nbuffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman’s jacket.\n“Why, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers,” answered the buffoon.\n“O Lord, O Lord, it’s always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What am I\nto do with myself?” And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly upstairs to\nsee Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.\nTwo governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which were\nplates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were discussing"}, {"page": 723, "text": "whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. Natásha sat down,\nlistened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air, and then got up again.\n“The island of Madagascar,” she said, “Ma-da-gas-car,” she repeated,\narticulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to Madame Schoss\nwho asked her what she was saying, she went out of the room.\nHer brother Pétya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on him he\nwas preparing fireworks to let off that night.\n“Pétya! Pétya!” she called to him. “Carry me downstairs.”\nPétya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her arms\nround his neck, and he pranced along with her.\n“No, don’t... the island of Madagascar!” she said, and jumping off his\nback she went downstairs.\nHaving as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made\nsure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was dull, Natásha\nbetook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar, sat down in a dark\ncorner behind a bookcase, and began to run her fingers over the strings in\nthe bass, picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had heard in\nPetersburg with Prince Andrew. What she drew from the guitar would have\nhad no meaning for other listeners, but in her imagination a whole series of\nreminiscences arose from those sounds. She sat behind the bookcase with\nher eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and\nlistened to herself and pondered. She was in a mood for brooding on the\npast.\nSónya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Natásha glanced at\nher and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her that she\nremembered the light falling through that crack once before and Sónya\npassing with a glass in her hand. “Yes it was exactly the same,” thought\nNatásha.\n“Sónya, what is this?” she cried, twanging a thick string.\n“Oh, you are there!” said Sónya with a start, and came near and listened.\n“I don’t know. A storm?” she ventured timidly, afraid of being wrong.\n“There! That’s just how she started and just how she came up smiling\ntimidly when all this happened before,” thought Natásha, “and in just the\nsame way I thought there was something lacking in her.”"}, {"page": 724, "text": "“No, it’s the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen!” and Natásha sang\nthe air of the chorus so that Sónya should catch it. “Where were you\ngoing?” she asked.\n“To change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design.”\n“You always find something to do, but I can’t,” said Natásha. “And\nwhere’s Nicholas?”\n“Asleep, I think.”\n“Sónya, go and wake him,” said Natásha. “Tell him I want him to come\nand sing.”\nShe sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened\nbefore could be, and without solving this problem, or at all regretting not\nhaving done so, she again passed in fancy to the time when she was with\nhim and he was looking at her with a lover’s eyes.\n“Oh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be! And,\nworst of all, I am growing old—that’s the thing! There won’t then be in me\nwhat there is now. But perhaps he’ll come today, will come immediately.\nPerhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room. Perhaps he came\nyesterday and I have forgotten it.” She rose, put down the guitar, and went\nto the drawing room.\nAll the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were already at\nthe tea table. The servants stood round the table—but Prince Andrew was\nnot there and life was going on as before.\n“Ah, here she is!” said the old count, when he saw Natásha enter. “Well,\nsit down by me.” But Natásha stayed by her mother and glanced round as if\nlooking for something.\n“Mamma!” she muttered, “give him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly,\nquickly!” and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.\nShe sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the\nelders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. “My God, my God!\nThe same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing in the\nsame way!” thought Natásha, feeling with horror a sense of repulsion rising\nup in her for the whole household, because they were always the same.\nAfter tea, Nicholas, Sónya, and Natásha went to the sitting room, to their\nfavorite corner where their most intimate talks always began."}, {"page": 725, "text": "CHAPTER X\n“Does it ever happen to you,” said Natásha to her brother, when they\nsettled down in the sitting room, “does it ever happen to you to feel as if\nthere were nothing more to come—nothing; that everything good is past?\nAnd to feel not exactly dull, but sad?”\n“I should think so!” he replied. “I have felt like that when everything was\nall right and everyone was cheerful. The thought has come into my mind\nthat I was already tired of it all, and that we must all die. Once in the\nregiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where there was music... and\nsuddenly I felt so depressed...”\n“Oh yes, I know, I know, I know!” Natásha interrupted him. “When I was\nquite little that used to be so with me. Do you remember when I was\npunished once about some plums? You were all dancing, and I sat sobbing\nin the schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and sorry for everyone,\nfor myself, and for everyone. And I was innocent—that was the chief\nthing,” said Natásha. “Do you remember?”\n“I remember,” answered Nicholas. “I remember that I came to you\nafterwards and wanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt ashamed to.\nWe were terribly absurd. I had a funny doll then and wanted to give it to\nyou. Do you remember?”\n“And do you remember,” Natásha asked with a pensive smile, “how\nonce, long, long ago, when we were quite little, Uncle called us into the\nstudy—that was in the old house—and it was dark—we went in and\nsuddenly there stood...”\n“A Negro,” chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. “Of course I\nremember. Even now I don’t know whether there really was a Negro, or if\nwe only dreamed it or were told about him.”\n“He was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and looked\nat us....”"}, {"page": 726, "text": "“Sónya, do you remember?” asked Nicholas.\n“Yes, yes, I do remember something too,” Sónya answered timidly.\n“You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro,” said\nNatásha, “and they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you\nremember!”\n“Of course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.”\n“How strange it is! It’s as if it were a dream! I like that.”\n“And do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom,\nand suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet? Was that\nreal or not? Do you remember what fun it was?”\n“Yes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the\nporch?”\nSo they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: not the sad\nmemories of old age, but poetic, youthful ones—those impressions of one’s\nmost distant past in which dreams and realities blend—and they laughed\nwith quiet enjoyment.\nSónya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they shared\nthe same reminiscences.\nMuch that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what she\nrecalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced. She\nsimply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.\nShe only really took part when they recalled Sónya’s first arrival. She\ntold them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because he had on a corded\njacket and her nurse had told her that she, too, would be sewn up with\ncords.\n“And I remember their telling me that you had been born under a\ncabbage,” said Natásha, “and I remember that I dared not disbelieve it then,\nbut knew that it was not true, and I felt so uncomfortable.”\nWhile they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of the\nsitting room.\n“They have brought the cock, Miss,” she said in a whisper.\n“It isn’t wanted, Pólya. Tell them to take it away,” replied Natásha.\nIn the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and went\nup to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its cloth covering,"}, {"page": 727, "text": "and the harp gave out a jarring sound.\n“Mr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,” came the old\ncountess’ voice from the drawing room.\nDimmler struck a chord and, turning to Natásha, Nicholas, and Sónya,\nremarked: “How quiet you young people are!”\n“Yes, we’re philosophizing,” said Natásha, glancing round for a moment\nand then continuing the conversation. They were now discussing dreams.\nDimmler began to play; Natásha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table,\ntook up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself quietly in her\nformer place. It was dark in the room especially where they were sitting on\nthe sofa, but through the big windows the silvery light of the full moon fell\non the floor. Dimmler had finished the piece but still sat softly running his\nfingers over the strings, evidently uncertain whether to stop or to play\nsomething else.\n“Do you know,” said Natásha in a whisper, moving closer to Nicholas\nand Sónya, “that when one goes on and on recalling memories, one at last\nbegins to remember what happened before one was in the world....”\n“That is metempsychosis,” said Sónya, who had always learned well, and\nremembered everything. “The Egyptians believed that our souls have lived\nin animals, and will go back into animals again.”\n“No, I don’t believe we ever were in animals,” said Natásha, still in a\nwhisper though the music had ceased. “But I am certain that we were angels\nsomewhere there, and have been here, and that is why we remember....”\n“May I join you?” said Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat\ndown by them.\n“If we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?” said Nicholas. “No,\nthat can’t be!”\n“Not lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I was\nbefore?” Natásha rejoined with conviction. “The soul is immortal—well\nthen, if I shall always live I must have lived before, lived for a whole\neternity.”\n“Yes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,” remarked Dimmler, who\nhad joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now\nspoke as quietly and seriously as they."}, {"page": 728, "text": "“Why is it hard to imagine eternity?” said Natásha. “It is now today, and\nit will be tomorrow, and always; and there was yesterday, and the day\nbefore....”\n“Natásha! Now it’s your turn. Sing me something,” they heard the\ncountess say. “Why are you sitting there like conspirators?”\n“Mamma, I don’t at all want to,” replied Natásha, but all the same she\nrose.\nNone of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to break off\ntheir conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room, but Natásha got\nup and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. Standing as usual in the middle\nof the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best, Natásha\nbegan to sing her mother’s favorite song.\nShe had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since she had sung,\nand long before she again sang, as she did that evening. The count, from his\nstudy where he was talking to Mítenka, heard her and, like a schoolboy in a\nhurry to run out to play, blundered in his talk while giving orders to the\nsteward, and at last stopped, while Mítenka stood in front of him also\nlistening and smiling. Nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and drew\nbreath in time with her. Sónya, as she listened, thought of the immense\ndifference there was between herself and her friend, and how impossible it\nwas for her to be anything like as bewitching as her cousin. The old\ncountess sat with a blissful yet sad smile and with tears in her eyes,\noccasionally shaking her head. She thought of Natásha and of her own\nyouth, and of how there was something unnatural and dreadful in this\nimpending marriage of Natásha and Prince Andrew.\nDimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with\nclosed eyes.\n“Ah, Countess,” he said at last, “that’s a European talent, she has nothing\nto learn—what softness, tenderness, and strength....”\n“Ah, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!” said the countess, not\nrealizing to whom she was speaking. Her maternal instinct told her that\nNatásha had too much of something, and that because of this she would not\nbe happy. Before Natásha had finished singing, fourteen-year-old Pétya\nrushed in delightedly, to say that some mummers had arrived.\nNatásha stopped abruptly."}, {"page": 729, "text": "“Idiot!” she screamed at her brother and, running to a chair, threw herself\non it, sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long time.\n“It’s nothing, Mamma, really it’s nothing; only Pétya startled me,” she\nsaid, trying to smile, but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked her.\nThe mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, Turks,\ninnkeepers, and ladies—frightening and funny—bringing in with them the\ncold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first timidly, into the\nanteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed into the ballroom\nwhere, shyly at first and then more and more merrily and heartily, they\nstarted singing, dancing, and playing Christmas games. The countess, when\nshe had identified them and laughed at their costumes, went into the\ndrawing room. The count sat in the ballroom, smiling radiantly and\napplauding the players. The young people had disappeared.\nHalf an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the\nballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt—this was Nicholas. A Turkish girl\nwas Pétya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was Natásha, and a Circassian\nwas Sónya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.\nAfter the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from those\nwho were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided that their\ncostumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere.\nNicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted to take\nthem all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with them about a dozen\nof the serf mummers and drive to “Uncle’s.”\n“No, why disturb the old fellow?” said the countess. “Besides, you\nwouldn’t have room to turn round there. If you must go, go to the\nMelyukóvs’.”\nMelyukóva was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors and\ngovernesses, lived three miles from the Rostóvs.\n“That’s right, my dear,” chimed in the old count, thoroughly aroused.\n“I’ll dress up at once and go with them. I’ll make Pashette open her eyes.”\nBut the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad leg all\nthese last days. It was decided that the count must not go, but that if Louisa\nIvánovna (Madame Schoss) would go with them, the young ladies might go\nto the Melyukóvs’, Sónya, generally so timid and shy, more urgently than\nanyone begging Louisa Ivánovna not to refuse."}, {"page": 730, "text": "Sónya’s costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows were\nextraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very handsome,\nand she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her. Some inner\nvoice told her that now or never her fate would be decided, and in her male\nattire she seemed quite a different person. Louisa Ivánovna consented to go,\nand in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and small bells, their\nrunners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow, drove up to the\nporch.\nNatásha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing\nfrom one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax when they all\ncame out into the frost and got into the sleighs, talking, calling to one\nanother, laughing, and shouting.\nTwo of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the\nold count’s with a trotter from the Orlóv stud as shaft horse, the fourth was\nNicholas’ own with a short shaggy black shaft horse. Nicholas, in his old\nlady’s dress over which he had belted his hussar overcoat, stood in the\nmiddle of the sleigh, reins in hand.\nIt was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal\nharness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked round in alarm at\nthe noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.\nNatásha, Sónya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas’\nsleigh; Dimmler, his wife, and Pétya, into the old count’s, and the rest of the\nmummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.\n“You go ahead, Zakhár!” shouted Nicholas to his father’s coachman,\nwishing for a chance to race past him.\nThe old count’s troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started forward,\nsqueaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, its deep-toned bell\nclanging. The side horses, pressing against the shafts of the middle horse,\nsank in the snow, which was dry and glittered like sugar, and threw it up.\nNicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the others moved\nnoisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove at a steady trot along the\nnarrow road. While they drove past the garden the shadows of the bare trees\noften fell across the road and hid the brilliant moonlight, but as soon as they\nwere past the fence, the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless\nspread out before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with bluish\nshadows. Bang, bang! went the first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of"}, {"page": 731, "text": "the road, and each of the other sleighs jolted in the same way, and rudely\nbreaking the frost-bound stillness, the troykas began to speed along the\nroad, one after the other.\n“A hare’s track, a lot of tracks!” rang out Natásha’s voice through the\nfrost-bound air.\n“How light it is, Nicholas!” came Sónya’s voice.\nNicholas glanced round at Sónya, and bent down to see her face closer.\nQuite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at\nhim from her sable furs—so close and yet so distant—in the moonlight.\n“That used to be Sónya,” thought he, and looked at her closer and smiled.\n“What is it, Nicholas?”\n“Nothing,” said he and turned again to the horses.\nWhen they came out onto the beaten highroad—polished by sleigh\nrunners and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were visible in\nthe moonlight—the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and\nincreased their pace. The near side horse, arching his head and breaking into\na short canter, tugged at his traces. The shaft horse swayed from side to\nside, moving his ears as if asking: “Isn’t it time to begin now?” In front,\nalready far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off,\nthe black horses driven by Zakhár could be clearly seen against the white\nsnow. From that sleigh one could hear the shouts, laughter, and voices of\nthe mummers.\n“Gee up, my darlings!” shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one side\nand flourishing the whip.\nIt was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the\nside horses who pulled harder—ever increasing their gallop—that one\nnoticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back. With\nscreams, squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses to\ngallop—the other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung steadily beneath\nthe bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and ready to put\non speed when required.\nNicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and\ncoming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.\n“Where are we?” thought he. “It’s the Kosóy meadow, I suppose. But no\n—this is something new I’ve never seen before. This isn’t the Kosóy"}, {"page": 732, "text": "meadow nor the Dëmkin hill, and heaven only knows what it is! It is\nsomething new and enchanted.

Nicholas began to draw ahead. Zakhár, while still\nkeeping his arms extended, raised one hand with the reins.\n“No you won’t, master!” he shouted.\nNicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakhár. The horses\nshowered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh—beside them\nsounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of swiftly\nmoving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing. The\nwhistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls shrieking\nwere heard from different sides.\nAgain checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They were still\nsurrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with stars.\n“Zakhár is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the left?”\nthought Nicholas. “Are we getting to the Melyukóvs’? Is this Melyukóvka?\nHeaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows what is\nhappening to us—but it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is.” And he\nlooked round in the sleigh.\n“Look, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!” said one of the strange,\npretty, unfamiliar people—the one with fine eyebrows and mustache.\n“I think this used to be Natásha,” thought Nicholas, “and that was\nMadame Schoss, but perhaps it’s not, and this Circassian with the mustache\nI don’t know, but I love her.”\n“Aren’t you cold?” he asked.\nThey did not answer but began to laugh.

They were\nquietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax\nfigures would throw on the wall, when they heard the steps and voices of\nnew arrivals in the vestibule.\nHussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, after clearing their throats\nand wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule, came into the\nballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted. The clown—Dimmler—and\nthe lady—Nicholas—started a dance. Surrounded by the screaming children\nthe mummers, covering their faces and disguising their voices, bowed to\ntheir hostess and arranged themselves about the room.\n“Dear me! there’s no recognizing them! And Natásha! See whom she\nlooks like! She really reminds me of somebody. But Herr Dimmler—isn’t\nhe good! I didn’t know him! And how he dances. Dear me, there’s a\nCircassian. Really, how becoming it is to dear Sónya. And who is that?\nWell, you have cheered us up! Nikíta and Vanya—clear away the tables!\nAnd we were sitting so quietly. Ha, ha, ha!... The hussar, the hussar! Just\nlike a boy! And the legs!... I can’t look at him...” different voices were\nsaying.\nNatásha, the young Melyukóvs’ favorite, disappeared with them into the\nback rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments\nwere called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from\nbehind the door. Ten minutes later, all the young Melyukóvs joined the\nmummers.\nPelagéya Danílovna, having given orders to clear the rooms for the\nvisitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs, went\nabout among the mummers without removing her spectacles, peering into"}, {"page": 735, "text": "their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any of them. It\nwas not merely Dimmler and the Rostóvs she failed to recognize, she did\nnot even recognize her own daughters, or her late husband’s, dressing\ngowns and uniforms, which they had put on.\n“And who is this?” she asked her governess, peering into the face of her\nown daughter dressed up as a Kazán-Tartar. “I suppose it is one of the\nRostóvs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what regiment do you serve in?” she asked\nNatásha. “Here, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!” she ordered the butler\nwho was handing things round. “That’s not forbidden by his law.”\nSometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the\ndancers, who—having decided once for all that being disguised, no one\nwould recognize them—were not at all shy, Pelagéya Danílovna hid her\nface in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook with irrepressible,\nkindly, elderly laughter.\n“My little Sásha! Look at Sásha!” she said.\nAfter Russian country dances and chorus dances, Pelagéya Danílovna\nmade the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a string, and a\nsilver ruble were fetched and they all played games together.\nIn an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. The corked\neyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring, flushed, and\nmerry faces. Pelagéya Danílovna began to recognize the mummers, admired\ntheir cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly how they suited the\nyoung ladies, and she thanked them all for having entertained her so well.\nThe visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room, and the serfs had\nsomething served to them in the ballroom.\n“Now to tell one’s fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening!” said an\nold maid who lived with the Melyukóvs, during supper.\n“Why?” said the eldest Melyukóv girl.\n“You wouldn’t go, it takes courage....”\n“I’ll go,” said Sónya.\n“Tell what happened to the young lady!” said the second Melyukóv girl.\n“Well,” began the old maid, “a young lady once went out, took a cock,\nlaid the table for two, all properly, and sat down.

It\nwas lucky the maids ran in just then....”\n“Now, why frighten them?” said Pelagéya Danílovna.\n“Mamma, you used to try your fate yourself...” said her daughter.\n“And how does one do it in a barn?” inquired Sónya.\n“Well, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It depends on what\nyou hear; hammering and knocking—that’s bad; but a sound of shifting\ngrain is good and one sometimes hears that, too.”\n“Mamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn.”\nPelagéya Danílovna smiled.\n“Oh, I’ve forgotten...” she replied. “But none of you would go?”\n“Yes, I will; Pelagéya Danílovna, let me! I’ll go,” said Sónya.\n“Well, why not, if you’re not afraid?”\n“Louisa Ivánovna, may I?” asked Sónya.\nWhether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or\ntalking as now, Nicholas did not leave Sónya’s side, and gazed at her with\nquite new eyes. It seemed to him that it was only today, thanks to that burnt-\ncork mustache, that he had fully learned to know her. And really, that\nevening, Sónya was brighter, more animated, and prettier than Nicholas had\never seen her before.\n“So that’s what she is like; what a fool I have been!” he thought gazing at\nher sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile\ndimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.\n“I’m not afraid of anything,” said Sónya. “May I go at once?” She got up.\nThey told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen,\nand they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her head and shoulders\nand glanced at Nicholas."}, {"page": 737, "text": "“What a darling that girl is!” thought he. “And what have I been thinking\nof till now?”\nSónya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went hastily\nto the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of people really had\nmade the house stuffy.\nOutside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but even\nbrighter than before. The light was so strong and the snow sparkled with so\nmany stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real stars were\nunnoticed. The sky was black and dreary, while the earth was gay.\n“I am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?” thought Nicholas,\nand running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and\nalong the path that led to the back porch. He knew Sónya would pass that\nway. Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood and across and\nalong them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the\nsnow and on the path. This path led to the barn. The log walls of the barn\nand its snow-covered roof, that looked as if hewn out of some precious\nstone, sparkled in the moonlight. A tree in the garden snapped with the\nfrost, and then all was again perfectly silent. His bosom seemed to inhale\nnot air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness.\nFrom the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the\nbottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard\nthe voice of an old maidservant saying, “Straight, straight, along the path,\nMiss. Only, don’t look back.”\n“I am not afraid,” answered Sónya’s voice, and along the path toward\nNicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of Sónya’s feet in her thin\nshoes.\nSónya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple of paces\naway when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas she had\nknown and always slightly feared. He was in a woman’s dress, with tousled\nhair and a happy smile new to Sónya. She ran rapidly toward him.\n“Quite different and yet the same,” thought Nicholas, looking at her face\nall lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the cloak that covered\nher head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and kissed her on the lips that\nwore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork. Sónya kissed him full on\nthe lips, and disengaging her little hands pressed them to his cheeks."}, {"page": 738, "text": "“Sónya!... Nicholas!”... was all they said.

He looked and\nrecognizing in her both the old and the new Sónya, and being reminded by\nthe smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss, inhaled the frosty air\nwith a full breast and, looking at the ground flying beneath him and at the\nsparkling sky, felt himself again in fairyland.\n“Sónya, is it well with thee?” he asked from time to time.\n“Yes!” she replied. “And with thee?”\nWhen halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran\nfor a moment to Natásha’s sleigh and stood on its wing.\n“Natásha!” he whispered in French, “do you know I have made up my\nmind about Sónya?”\n“Have you told her?” asked Natásha, suddenly beaming all over with joy.\n“Oh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!...\nNatásha—are you glad?”\n“I am so glad, so glad!

Nicholas replied that he could not go\nback on his word, and his father, sighing and evidently disconcerted, very\nsoon became silent and went in to the countess. In all his encounters with\nhis son, the count was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for\nhaving wasted the family fortune, and so he could not be angry with him for\nrefusing to marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless Sónya. On this\noccasion, he was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs\nhad not been in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than Sónya could have\nbeen wished for, and that no one but himself with his Mítenka and his\nuncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family finances.\nThe father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again, but a\nfew days later the countess sent for Sónya and, with a cruelty neither of\nthem expected, reproached her niece for trying to catch Nicholas and for\ningratitude. Sónya listened silently with downcast eyes to the countess’\ncruel words, without understanding what was required of her. She was\nready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors.

He first implored her to forgive him\nand Sónya and consent to their marriage, then he threatened that if she\nmolested Sónya he would at once marry her secretly.\nThe countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her before,\nreplied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying without his\nfather’s consent, and he could do the same, but that she would never receive\nthat intriguer as her daughter.\nExploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, told his\nmother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his feelings, but\nif that were so, he would say for the last time.... But he had no time to utter\nthe decisive word which the expression of his face caused his mother to\nawait with terror, and which would perhaps have forever remained a cruel\nmemory to them both.

His letters for the most part irritated her. It hurt\nher to think that while she lived only in the thought of him, he was living a\nreal life, seeing new places and new people that interested him. The more\ninteresting his letters were the more vexed she felt. Her letters to him, far\nfrom giving her any comfort, seemed to her a wearisome and artificial\nobligation. She could not write, because she could not conceive the\npossibility of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what\nshe expressed by voice, smile, and glance.

Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged in, the evil and\nfalsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity. Yet he had\nto live and to find occupation.

From reading he passed to sleeping, from sleeping to gossip in\ndrawing rooms of the club, from gossip to carousals and women; from\ncarousals back to gossip, reading, and wine. Drinking became more and\nmore a physical and also a moral necessity.

She was surrounded by young men who, she fancied, had\nsuddenly learned to appreciate her worth. Julie was at that stage in the life\nof a society woman when she feels that her last chance of marrying has\ncome and that her fate must be decided now or never. On Thursdays\nPrincess Mary remembered with a mournful smile that she now had no one\nto write to, since Julie—whose presence gave her no pleasure was here and\nthey met every week. Like the old émigré who declined to marry the lady\nwith whom he had spent his evenings for years, she regretted Julie’s\npresence and having no one to write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no\none to talk to, no one to whom to confide her sorrow, and much sorrow fell\nto her lot just then. The time for Prince Andrew’s return and marriage was\napproaching, but his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been\ncarried out; in fact, it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless, for at every\nmention of the young Countess Rostóva the old prince (who apart from that\nwas usually in a bad temper) lost control of himself. Another lately added\nsorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year-old nephew. To her\nconsternation she detected in herself in relation to little Nicholas some\nsymptoms of her father’s irritability. However often she told herself that she\nmust not get irritable when teaching her nephew, almost every time that,\npointer in hand, she sat down to show him the French alphabet, she so\nlonged to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child—who\nwas already afraid that Auntie might at any moment get angry—that at his\nslightest inattention she trembled, became flustered and heated, raised her\nvoice, and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner.\nHaving put him in the corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel,\nevil nature, and little Nicholas, following her example, would sob, and\nwithout permission would leave his corner, come to her, pull her wet hands\nfrom her face, and comfort her. But what distressed the princess most of all"}, {"page": 755, "text": "was her father’s irritability, which was always directed against her and had\nof late amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the\nground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water, it\nwould never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but this\nloving despot—the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason\ntormented himself and her—knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her\ndeliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame for everything.\nOf late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented Princess Mary more than\nanything else; this was his ever-increasing intimacy with Mademoiselle\nBourienne. The idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of his\nson’s intentions had occurred to him in jest—that if Andrew got married he\nhimself would marry Bourienne—had evidently pleased him, and latterly he\nhad persistently, and as it seemed to Princess Mary merely to offend her,\nshown special endearments to the companion and expressed his\ndissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of Bourienne.\nOne day in Moscow in Princess Mary’s presence (she thought her father\ndid it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle\nBourienne’s hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately.\nPrincess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few minutes later\nMademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary’s room smiling and\nmaking cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess Mary hastily\nwiped away her tears, went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne, and\nevidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste\nat the Frenchwoman, her voice breaking: “It’s horrible, vile, inhuman, to\ntake advantage of the weakness...” She did not finish. “Leave my room,”\nshe exclaimed, and burst into sobs.\nNext day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she noticed\nthat at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be served\nfirst. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee and from habit began\nwith the princess, the prince suddenly grew furious, threw his stick at\nPhilip, and instantly gave instructions to have him conscripted for the army.\n“He doesn’t obey... I said it twice... and he doesn’t obey! She is the first\nperson in this house; she’s my best friend,” cried the prince. “And if you\nallow yourself,” he screamed in a fury, addressing Princess Mary for the\nfirst time, “to forget yourself again before her as you dared to do yesterday,"}, {"page": 756, "text": "I will show you who is master in this house. Go! Don’t let me set eyes on\nyou; beg her pardon!”\nPrincess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne’s pardon, and also her\nfather’s pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged for\nher intervention.\nAt such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her soul.\nAnd suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his\nspectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not seeing them, or\nwould forget something that had just occurred, or take a false step with his\nfailing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness, or, worst of\nall, at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him would suddenly fall\nasleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking head sink over his plate. “He\nis old and feeble, and I dare to condemn him!” she thought at such\nmoments, with a feeling of revulsion against herself."}, {"page": 757, "text": "CHAPTER III\nIn 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctor—Métivier—who\nhad rapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome,\namiable as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an extraordinarily\nclever doctor. He was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor, but\nas an equal.\nPrince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on\nMademoiselle Bourienne’s advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and\nhad grown accustomed to him. Métivier came to see the prince about twice\na week.\nOn December 6—St. Nicholas’ Day and the prince’s name day—all\nMoscow came to the prince’s front door but he gave orders to admit no one\nand to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom he gave to\nPrincess Mary.\nMétivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered it\nproper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne, * as he told Princess\nMary, and went in to see the prince. It happened that on that morning of his\nname day the prince was in one of his worst moods. He had been going\nabout the house all the morning finding fault with everyone and pretending\nnot to understand what was said to him and not to be understood himself.\nPrincess Mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed querulousness, which\ngenerally culminated in a burst of rage, and she went about all that morning\nas though facing a cocked and loaded gun and awaited the inevitable\nexplosion. Until the doctor’s arrival the morning had passed off safely. After\nadmitting the doctor, Princess Mary sat down with a book in the drawing\nroom near the door through which she could hear all that passed in the\nstudy.\n* To force the guard."}, {"page": 758, "text": "At first she heard only Métivier’s voice, then her father’s, then both\nvoices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open, and on\nthe threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified Métivier with\nhis shock of black hair, and the prince in his dressing gown and fez, his face\ndistorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards.\n“You don’t understand?” shouted the prince, “but I do! French spy, slave\nof Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell you...” and he\nslammed the door.\nMétivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne\nwho at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.\n“The prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head. Keep\ncalm, I will call again tomorrow,” said Métivier; and putting his fingers to\nhis lips he hastened away.\nThrough the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry:\n“Spies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment’s peace in my own\nhouse!”\nAfter Métivier’s departure the old prince called his daughter in, and the\nwhole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a spy had been\nadmitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit\nanyone who was not on that list? Then why was that scoundrel admitted?\nShe was the cause of it all. With her, he said, he could not have a moment’s\npeace and could not die quietly.\n“No, ma’am! We must part, we must part! Understand that, understand it!\nI cannot endure any more,” he said, and left the room. Then, as if afraid she\nmight find some means of consolation, he returned and trying to appear\ncalm added: “And don’t imagine I have said this in a moment of anger. I am\ncalm. I have thought it over, and it will be carried out—we must part; so\nfind some place for yourself....” But he could not restrain himself and with\nthe virulence of which only one who loves is capable, evidently suffering\nhimself, he shook his fists at her and screamed:\n“If only some fool would marry her!” Then he slammed the door, sent for\nMademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.\nAt two o’clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.\nThese guests—the famous Count Rostopchín, Prince Lopukhín with his\nnephew, General Chatróv an old war comrade of the prince’s, and of the"}, {"page": 759, "text": "younger generation Pierre and Borís Drubetskóy—awaited the prince in the\ndrawing room.\nBorís, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been\nanxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolkónski, and had contrived to\ningratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an exception\nto the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house.\nThe prince’s house did not belong to what is known as fashionable\nsociety, but his little circle—though not much talked about in town—was\none it was more flattering to be received in than any other. Borís had\nrealized this the week before when the commander in chief in his presence\ninvited Rostopchín to dinner on St. Nicholas’ Day, and Rostopchín had\nreplied that he could not come:\n“On that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince\nNicholas Bolkónski.”\n“Oh, yes, yes!” replied the commander in chief. “How is he?...”\nThe small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old-fashioned\ndrawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a\ncourt of justice. All were silent or talked in low tones. Prince Nicholas came\nin serious and taciturn. Princess Mary seemed even quieter and more\ndiffident than usual. The guests were reluctant to address her, feeling that\nshe was in no mood for their conversation. Count Rostopchín alone kept the\nconversation going, now relating the latest town news, and now the latest\npolitical gossip.\nLopukhín and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation.\nPrince Bolkónski listened as a presiding judge receives a report, only now\nand then, silently or by a brief word, showing that he took heed of what was\nbeing reported to him. The tone of the conversation was such as indicated\nthat no one approved of what was being done in the political world.\nIncidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that everything was\ngoing from bad to worse, but whether telling a story or giving an opinion\nthe speaker always stopped, or was stopped, at the point beyond which his\ncriticism might touch the sovereign himself.\nAt dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleon’s seizure\nof the Duke of Oldenburg’s territory, and the Russian Note, hostile to\nNapoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts."}, {"page": 760, "text": "“Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,” said Count\nRostopchín, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before. “One\nonly wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the crowned heads. Now\nthe Pope’s turn has come and Bonaparte doesn’t scruple to depose the head\nof the Catholic Church—yet all keep silent! Our sovereign alone has\nprotested against the seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg’s territory, and\neven...” Count Rostopchín paused, feeling that he had reached the limit\nbeyond which censure was impossible.\n“Other territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of\nOldenburg,” said Prince Bolkónski. “He shifts the Dukes about as I might\nmove my serfs from Bald Hills to Boguchárovo or my Ryazán estates.”\n“The Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength\nof character and resignation,” remarked Borís, joining in respectfully.\nHe said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor\nof being presented to the Duke. Prince Bolkónski glanced at the young man\nas if about to say something in reply, but changed his mind, evidently\nconsidering him too young.\n“I have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was surprised\nhow badly the Note was worded,” remarked Count Rostopchín in the casual\ntone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him.\nPierre looked at Rostopchín with naïve astonishment, not understanding\nwhy he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the Note.\n“Does it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,” he asked, “so long as\nits substance is forcible?”\n“My dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy\nto have a good style,” returned Count Rostopchín.\nPierre now understood the count’s dissatisfaction with the wording of the\nNote.\n“One would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up,” remarked\nthe old prince. “There in Petersburg they are always writing—not notes\nonly but even new laws. My Andrew there has written a whole volume of\nlaws for Russia. Nowadays they are always writing!” and he laughed\nunnaturally.\nThere was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general\ncleared his throat to draw attention."}, {"page": 761, "text": "“Did you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The figure\ncut by the new French ambassador.”\n“Eh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward in His\nMajesty’s presence.”\n“His Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the march\npast,” continued the general, “and it seems the ambassador took no notice\nand allowed himself to reply that: ‘We in France pay no attention to such\ntrifles!’ The Emperor did not condescend to reply. At the next review, they\nsay, the Emperor did not once deign to address him.”\nAll were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it was\nimpossible to pass any judgment.\n“Impudent fellows!” said the prince. “You know Métivier? I turned him\nout of my house this morning. He was here; they admitted him in spite of\nmy request that they should let no one in,” he went on, glancing angrily at\nhis daughter.\nAnd he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and the\nreasons that convinced him that Métivier was a spy. Though these reasons\nwere very insufficient and obscure, no one made any rejoinder.\nAfter the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to congratulate\nthe old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.\nHe gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled, clean-\nshaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told her that he had\nnot forgotten the morning’s talk, that his decision remained in force, and\nonly the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to her now.\nWhen they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the old\nmen sat together.\nPrince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the\nimpending war.\nHe said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we\nsought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into European\naffairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit. “We ought not\nto fight either for or against Austria. Our political interests are all in the\nEast, and in regard to Bonaparte the only thing is to have an armed frontier\nand a firm policy, and he will never dare to cross the Russian frontier, as\nwas the case in 1807!”"}, {"page": 762, "text": "“How can we fight the French, Prince?” said Count Rostopchín. “Can we\narm ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at our youths, look\nat our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our Kingdom of Heaven.”\nHe began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.\n“French dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you turned\nMétivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a Frenchman and a\nscoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their knees. I went to a party\nlast night, and there out of five ladies three were Roman Catholics and had\nthe Pope’s indulgence for doing woolwork on Sundays. And they\nthemselves sit there nearly naked, like the signboards at our Public Baths if\nI may say so. Ah, when one looks at our young people, Prince, one would\nlike to take Peter the Great’s old cudgel out of the museum and belabor\nthem in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them.”\nAll were silent. The old prince looked at Rostopchín with a smile and\nwagged his head approvingly.\n“Well, good-by, your excellency, keep well!” said Rostopchín, getting up\nwith characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince.\n“Good-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of hearing\nhim!” said the old prince, keeping hold of the hand and offering his cheek\nto be kissed.\nFollowing Rostopchín’s example the others also rose."}, {"page": 763, "text": "CHAPTER IV\nPrincess Mary as she sat listening to the old men’s talk and faultfinding,\nunderstood nothing of what she heard; she only wondered whether the\nguests had all observed her father’s hostile attitude toward her.

Why do you ask me that?” said\nPrincess Mary, still thinking of that morning’s conversation with her father.\n“Because I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from\nPetersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an heiress.”\n“You have observed that?” said Princess Mary.\n“Yes,” returned Pierre with a smile, “and this young man now manages\nmatters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too.

He is very\nmelancholy with Mademoiselle Karágina,” said Pierre.\n“Really?” asked Princess Mary, looking into Pierre’s kindly face and still\nthinking of her own sorrow. “It would be a relief,” thought she, “if I\nventured to confide what I am feeling to someone. I should like to tell\neverything to Pierre. He is kind and generous. It would be a relief. He\nwould give me advice.”\n“Would you marry him?”\n“Oh, my God, Count, there are moments when I would marry anybody!”\nshe cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice. “Ah,\nhow bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that...” she went on\nin a trembling voice, “that you can do nothing for him but grieve him, and\nto know that you cannot alter this. Then there is only one thing left—to go\naway, but where could I go?”\n“What is wrong? What is it, Princess?”\nBut without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst into\ntears.\n“I don’t know what is the matter with me today. Don’t take any notice—\nforget what I have said!”\nPierre’s gaiety vanished completely. He anxiously questioned the\nprincess, asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him; but she\nonly repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said, that she did\nnot remember what she had said, and that she had no trouble except the one\nhe knew of—that Prince Andrew’s marriage threatened to cause a rupture\nbetween father and son.\n“Have you any news of the Rostóvs?” she asked, to change the subject. “I\nwas told they are coming soon. I am also expecting Andrew any day. I"}, {"page": 765, "text": "should like them to meet here.”\n“And how does he now regard the matter?” asked Pierre, referring to the\nold prince.\nPrincess Mary shook her head.\n“What is to be done? In a few months the year will be up. The thing is\nimpossible. I only wish I could spare my brother the first moments. I wish\nthey would come sooner. I hope to be friends with her. You have known\nthem a long time,” said Princess Mary. “Tell me honestly the whole truth:\nwhat sort of girl is she, and what do you think of her?—The real truth,\nbecause you know Andrew is risking so much doing this against his father’s\nwill that I should like to know....”\nAn undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations, and repeated\nrequests to be told the whole truth, expressed ill-will on the princess’ part\ntoward her future sister-in-law and a wish that he should disapprove of\nAndrew’s choice; but in reply he said what he felt rather than what he\nthought.\n“I don’t know how to answer your question,” he said, blushing without\nknowing why. “I really don’t know what sort of girl she is; I can’t analyze\nher at all. She is enchanting, but what makes her so I don’t know. That is all\none can say about her.”\nPrincess Mary sighed, and the expression on her face said: “Yes, that’s\nwhat I expected and feared.”\n“Is she clever?” she asked.\nPierre considered.\n“I think not,” he said, “and yet—yes. She does not deign to be clever....\nOh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all.”\nPrincess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.\n“Ah, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do.”\n“I hear they are expected very soon,” said Pierre.\nPrincess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future\nsister-in-law as soon as the Rostóvs arrived and to try to accustom the old\nprince to her."}, {"page": 766, "text": "CHAPTER V\nBorís had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg, so\nwith the same object in view he came to Moscow. There he wavered\nbetween the two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though Princess\nMary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than Julie, he,\nwithout knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to her. When they\nhad last met on the old prince’s name day, she had answered at random all\nhis attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently not listening to what he was\nsaying.\nJulie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though in a manner\npeculiar to herself.\nShe was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she had become\nvery wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought herself not\nmerely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive. She was\nconfirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very wealthy\nheiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less dangerous she\nbecame to men, and the more freely they could associate with her and avail\nthemselves of her suppers, soirees, and the animated company that\nassembled at her house, without incurring any obligation. A man who would\nhave been afraid ten years before of going every day to the house when\nthere was a girl of seventeen there, for fear of compromising her and\ncommitting himself, would now go boldly every day and treat her not as a\nmarriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance.\nThat winter the Karágins’ house was the most agreeable and hospitable in\nMoscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner parties, a large\ncompany, chiefly of men, gathered there every day, supping at midnight and\nstaying till three in the morning. Julie never missed a ball, a promenade, or\na play. Her dresses were always of the latest fashion. But in spite of that she\nseemed to be disillusioned about everything and told everyone that she did\nnot believe either in friendship or in love, or any of the joys of life, and"}, {"page": 767, "text": "expected peace only “yonder.” She adopted the tone of one who has\nsuffered a great disappointment, like a girl who has either lost the man she\nloved or been cruelly deceived by him. Though nothing of the kind had\nhappened to her she was regarded in that light, and had even herself come\nto believe that she had suffered much in life. This melancholy, which did\nnot prevent her amusing herself, did not hinder the young people who came\nto her house from passing the time pleasantly. Every visitor who came to\nthe house paid his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess, and then\namused himself with society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts\nrimés, which were in vogue at the Karágins’. Only a few of these young\nmen, among them Borís, entered more deeply into Julie’s melancholy, and\nwith these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of all\nworldly things, and to them she showed her albums filled with mournful\nsketches, maxims, and verses.\nTo Borís, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early\ndisillusionment with life, offered him such consolation of friendship as she\nwho had herself suffered so much could render, and showed him her album.\nBorís sketched two trees in the album and wrote: “Rustic trees, your dark\nbranches shed gloom and melancholy upon me.”\nOn another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:\nLa mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.\nAh! contre les douleurs il n’y a pas d’autre asile. *\n* Death gives relief and death is peaceful.\nAh! from suffering there is no other refuge.\nJulie said this was charming\n“There is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy,” she said\nto Borís, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a book. “It\nis a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness and despair,\nshowing the possibility of consolation.”\nIn reply Borís wrote these lines:\nAliment de poison d’une âme trop sensible,\nToi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,\nTendre mélancholie, ah, viens me consoler,\nViens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,\nEt mêle une douceur secrète\nA ces pleurs que je sens couler. *"}, {"page": 768, "text": "*Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul,\nThou, without whom happiness would for me be impossible,\nTender melancholy, ah, come to console me,\nCome to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat,\nAnd mingle a secret sweetness\nWith these tears that I feel to be flowing.\nFor Borís, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. Borís read\nPoor Liza aloud to her, and more than once interrupted the reading because\nof the emotions that choked him. Meeting at large gatherings Julie and\nBorís looked on one another as the only souls who understood one another\nin a world of indifferent people.\nAnna Mikháylovna, who often visited the Karágins, while playing cards\nwith the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie’s dowry (she was to have\ntwo estates in Pénza and the Nizhegórod forests). Anna Mikháylovna\nregarded the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy Julie with\nemotion, and resignation to the Divine will.\n“You are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie,” she said to\nthe daughter. “Borís says his soul finds repose at your house. He has\nsuffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive,” said she to the\nmother. “Ah, my dear, I can’t tell you how fond I have grown of Julie\nlatterly,” she said to her son. “But who could help loving her? She is an\nangelic being! Ah, Borís, Borís!”—she paused. “And how I pity her\nmother,” she went on; “today she showed me her accounts and letters from\nPénza (they have enormous estates there), and she, poor thing, has no one to\nhelp her, and they do cheat her so!”\nBorís smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother. He\nlaughed blandly at her naïve diplomacy but listened to what she had to say,\nand sometimes questioned her carefully about the Pénza and Nizhegórod\nestates.\nJulie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and\nwas ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of repulsion for her, for her\npassionate desire to get married, for her artificiality, and a feeling of horror\nat renouncing the possibility of real love still restrained Borís. His leave\nwas expiring. He spent every day and whole days at the Karágins’, and\nevery day on thinking the matter over told himself that he would propose\ntomorrow. But in Julie’s presence, looking at her red face and chin (nearly\nalways powdered), her moist eyes, and her expression of continual"}, {"page": 769, "text": "readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural rapture of\nmarried bliss, Borís could not utter the decisive words, though in\nimagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of those Pénza\nand Nizhegórod estates and had apportioned the use of the income from\nthem. Julie saw Borís’ indecision, and sometimes the thought occurred to\nher that she was repulsive to him, but her feminine self-deception\nimmediately supplied her with consolation, and she told herself that he was\nonly shy from love. Her melancholy, however, began to turn to irritability,\nand not long before Borís’ departure she formed a definite plan of action.\nJust as Borís’ leave of absence was expiring, Anatole Kurágin made his\nappearance in Moscow, and of course in the Karágins’ drawing room, and\nJulie, suddenly abandoning her melancholy, became cheerful and very\nattentive to Kurágin.\n“My dear,” said Anna Mikháylovna to her son, “I know from a reliable\nsource that Prince Vasíli has sent his son to Moscow to get him married to\nJulie. I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for her. What do you think\nof it, my dear?”\nThe idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole\nmonth of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing all the revenue\nfrom the Pénza estates which he had already mentally apportioned and put\nto proper use fall into the hands of another, and especially into the hands of\nthat idiot Anatole, pained Borís. He drove to the Karágins’ with the firm\nintention of proposing. Julie met him in a gay, careless manner, spoke\ncasually of how she had enjoyed yesterday’s ball, and asked when he was\nleaving. Though Borís had come intentionally to speak of his love and\ntherefore meant to be tender, he began speaking irritably of feminine\ninconstancy, of how easily women can turn from sadness to joy, and how\ntheir moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them. Julie\nwas offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs variety, and\nthe same thing over and over again would weary anyone.\n“Then I should advise you...” Borís began, wishing to sting her; but at\nthat instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to leave\nMoscow without having accomplished his aim, and have vainly wasted his\nefforts—which was a thing he never allowed to happen.\nHe checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes to\navoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and said:"}, {"page": 770, "text": "“I did not come here at all to quarrel with you.

The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was\nimpossible to wait for her recovery. Prince Andrew was expected in\nMoscow any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near\nMoscow had to be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his\nfuture daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolkónski while he was in Moscow\ncould not be missed. The Rostóvs’ Moscow house had not been heated that\nwinter and, as they had come only for a short time and the countess was not\nwith them, the count decided to stay with Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova,\nwho had long been pressing her hospitality on them.\nLate one evening the Rostóvs’ four sleighs drove into Márya\nDmítrievna’s courtyard in the old Konyúsheny street. Márya Dmítrievna\nlived alone. She had already married off her daughter, and her sons were all\nin the service.\nShe held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly, loudly,\nand bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach to others for\nany weakness, passion, or temptation—the possibility of which she did not\nadmit. From early in the morning, wearing a dressing jacket, she attended to\nher household affairs, and then she drove out: on holy days to church and\nafter the service to jails and prisons on affairs of which she never spoke to\nanyone. On ordinary days, after dressing, she received petitioners of various\nclasses, of whom there were always some. Then she had dinner, a\nsubstantial and appetizing meal at which there were always three or four\nguests; after dinner she played a game of boston, and at night she had the\nnewspapers or a new book read to her while she knitted. She rarely made an\nexception and went out to pay visits, and then only to the most important\npersons in the town.\nShe had not yet gone to bed when the Rostóvs arrived and the pulley of\nthe hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the Rostóvs and their"}, {"page": 772, "text": "servants.

Bring them here,” she said, pointing to the\nportmanteaus and not greeting anyone. “The young ladies’? There to the\nleft. Now what are you dawdling for?” she cried to the maids. “Get the\nsamovar ready!... You’ve grown plumper and prettier,” she remarked,\ndrawing Natásha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold) to her by the\nhood. “Foo! You are cold! Now take off your things, quick!” she shouted to\nthe count who was going to kiss her hand. “You’re half frozen, I’m sure!\nBring some rum for tea!... Bonjour, Sónya dear!” she added, turning to\nSónya and indicating by this French greeting her slightly contemptuous\nthough affectionate attitude toward her.\nWhen they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things and\ntidied themselves up after their journey, Márya Dmítrievna kissed them all\nin due order.\n“I’m heartily glad you have come and are staying with me. It was high\ntime,” she said, giving Natásha a significant look. “The old man is here and\nhis son’s expected any day. You’ll have to make his acquaintance. But we’ll\nspeak of that later on,” she added, glancing at Sónya with a look that\nshowed she did not want to speak of it in her presence. “Now listen,” she\nsaid to the count. “What do you want tomorrow?

I’ll\ntake them where they must go, scold them a bit, and pet them a bit,” said\nMárya Dmítrievna, touching her goddaughter and favorite, Natásha, on the\ncheek with her large hand.\nNext morning Márya Dmítrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian\nshrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so\nafraid of Márya Dmítrievna that she always let her have costumes at a loss\nmerely to get rid of her. Márya Dmítrievna ordered almost the whole\ntrousseau. When they got home she turned everybody out of the room\nexcept Natásha, and then called her pet to her armchair.\n“Well, now we’ll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed. You’ve\nhooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I’ve known him since he\nwas so high.” She held her hand a couple of feet from the ground. Natásha\nblushed happily. “I like him and all his family. Now listen! You know that\nold Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son’s marrying. The old fellow’s\ncrotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a child and can shift without\nhim, but it’s not nice to enter a family against a father’s will. One wants to\ndo it peacefully and lovingly. You’re a clever girl and you’ll know how to\nmanage. Be kind, and use your wits. Then all will be well.”\nNatásha remained silent, from shyness Márya Dmítrievna supposed, but\nreally because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love of\nPrince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs that no\none could understand it. She loved and knew Prince Andrew, he loved her\nonly, and was to come one of these days and take her. She wanted nothing\nmore.\n“You see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your\nfuture sister-in-law. ‘Husbands’ sisters bring up blisters,’ but this one\nwouldn’t hurt a fly.

The count did not set out cheerfully on\nthis visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well remembered the last interview he\nhad had with the old prince at the time of the enrollment, when in reply to\nan invitation to dinner he had had to listen to an angry reprimand for not\nhaving provided his full quota of men. Natásha, on the other hand, having\nput on her best gown, was in the highest spirits. “They can’t help liking\nme,” she thought. “Everybody always has liked me, and I am so willing to\ndo anything they wish, so ready to be fond of him—for being his father—\nand of her—for being his sister—that there is no reason for them not to like\nme....”\nThey drove up to the gloomy old house on the Vozdvízhenka and entered\nthe vestibule.\n“Well, the Lord have mercy on us!” said the count, half in jest, half in\nearnest; but Natásha noticed that her father was flurried on entering the\nanteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and princess\nwere at home.\nWhen they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the\nservants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by\nanother in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a\nmaidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning the\nprincess. At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced to the\nRostóvs that the prince was not receiving, but that the princess begged them\nto walk up. The first person who came to meet the visitors was\nMademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the father and daughter with special\npoliteness and showed them to the princess’ room.

Apart from this insuperable antipathy\nto her, Princess Mary was agitated just then because on the Rostóvs’ being\nannounced, the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them, that\nPrincess Mary might do so if she chose, but they were not to be admitted to\nhim. She had decided to receive them, but feared lest the prince might at\nany moment indulge in some freak, as he seemed much upset by the\nRostóvs’ visit.\n“There, my dear princess, I’ve brought you my songstress,” said the\ncount, bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince might\nappear. “I am so glad you should get to know one another... very sorry the\nprince is still ailing,” and after a few more commonplace remarks he rose.\n“If you’ll allow me to leave my Natásha in your hands for a quarter of an\nhour, Princess, I’ll drive round to see Anna Semënovna, it’s quite near in the\nDogs’ Square, and then I’ll come back for her.”\nThe count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told his\ndaughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk to one\nanother freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of encountering\nthe old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention this to his\ndaughter, but Natásha noticed her father’s nervousness and anxiety and felt\nmortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still angrier at having blushed,\nand looked at the princess with a bold and defiant expression which said\nthat she was not afraid of anybody. The princess told the count that she\nwould be delighted, and only begged him to stay longer at Anna\nSemënovna’s, and he departed.\nDespite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary—who wished\nto have a tête-à-tête with Natásha—Mademoiselle Bourienne remained in\nthe room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and theaters.\nNatásha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom, by\nher father’s nervousness, and by the unnatural manner of the princess who\n—she thought—was making a favor of receiving her, and so everything\ndispleased her.

The same\nthought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary. She knew what she\nought to have said to Natásha, but she had been unable to say it because\nMademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and because, without knowing\nwhy, she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage.

When she came ready\ndressed into the ballroom to await her father, and looking in the large mirror\nthere saw that she was pretty, very pretty, she felt even more sad, but it was\na sweet, tender sadness.\n“O God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did then, but\ndifferently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply\nembrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those searching\ninquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me, and then I would\nmake him laugh as he used to laugh.

Through the closed doors the music was already audible.\n“Natásha, your hair!...” whispered Sónya.\nAn attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and\nopened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the\ndoor rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and\nshoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered before their\neyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy at\nNatásha. The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being played.\nNatásha, smoothing her gown, went in with Sónya and sat down, scanning\nthe brilliant tiers of boxes opposite. A sensation she had not experienced for\na long time—that of hundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and neck—\nsuddenly affected her both agreeably and disagreeably and called up a\nwhole crowd of memories, desires and emotions associated with that\nfeeling.\nThe two remarkably pretty girls, Natásha and Sónya, with Count Rostóv\nwho had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted general\nattention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of Natásha’s engagement to\nPrince Andrew, and knew that the Rostóvs had lived in the country ever\nsince, and all looked with curiosity at a fiancée who was making one of the\nbest matches in Russia.\nNatásha’s looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the country, and\nthat evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty. She struck\nthose who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty, combined with her\nindifference to everything about her. Her black eyes looked at the crowd\nwithout seeking anyone, and her delicate arm, bare to above the elbow, lay\non the velvet edge of the box, while, evidently unconsciously, she opened\nand closed her hand in time to the music, crumpling her program. “Look,\nthere’s Alénina,” said Sónya, “with her mother, isn’t it?”\n“Dear me, Michael Kirílovich has grown still stouter!” remarked the\ncount.\n“Look at our Anna Mikháylovna—what a headdress she has on!”\n“The Karágins, Julie—and Borís with them.

Behind them, wearing a smile and leaning over with\nan ear to Julie’s mouth, was Borís’ handsome smoothly brushed head. He\nlooked at the Rostóvs from under his brows and said something, smiling, to\nhis betrothed.\n“They are talking about us, about me and him!” thought Natásha. “And\nhe no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They needn’t trouble\nthemselves! If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of\nthem.”\nBehind them sat Anna Mikháylovna wearing a green headdress and with\na happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face.

While\nNatásha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady looked\nround and, meeting the count’s eyes, nodded to him and smiled.

In the center of the stage sat some girls in red bodices and\nwhite skirts.

When they had finished their song the girl in white went up to\nthe prompter’s box and a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs,\nand holding a plume and a dagger, went up to her and began singing,\nwaving his arms about.\nFirst the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang, then they\nboth paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand of the\ngirl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with her. They\nsang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and shouting,\nwhile the man and woman on the stage—who represented lovers—began\nsmiling, spreading out their arms, and bowing.\nAfter her life in the country, and in her present serious mood, all this\nseemed grotesque and amazing to Natásha. She could not follow the opera\nnor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted cardboard and the\nqueerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so strangely\nin that brilliant light. She knew what it was all meant to represent, but it was\nso pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors\nand then amused at them.

She kept looking round in turn at the rows of\npomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude women in the boxes,\nespecially at Hélène in the next box, who—apparently quite unclothed—sat\nwith a quiet tranquil smile, not taking her eyes off the stage.

As she looked and thought, the\nstrangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her\nmind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and\nsinging the aria the actress was singing, then she wished to touch with her\nfan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then to lean over to Hélène\nand tickle her.\nAt a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song, a\ndoor leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rostóvs’ box creaked, and\nthe steps of a belated arrival were heard. “There’s Kurágin!” whispered\nShinshín. Countess Bezúkhova turned smiling to the newcomer, and\nNatásha, following the direction of that look, saw an exceptionally\nhandsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet courteous\nbearing. This was Anatole Kurágin whom she had seen and noticed long\nago at the ball in Petersburg. He was now in an adjutant’s uniform with one\nepaulet and a shoulder knot. He moved with a restrained swagger which\nwould have been ridiculous had he not been so good-looking and had his\nhandsome face not worn such an expression of good-humored complacency\nand gaiety. Though the performance was proceeding, he walked deliberately\ndown the carpeted gangway, his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his\nhandsome perfumed head held high. Having looked at Natásha he\napproached his sister, laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her box,\nnodded to her, and leaning forward asked a question, with a motion toward\nNatásha.\n“Mais charmante!” said he, evidently referring to Natásha, who did not\nexactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his lips.\nThen he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down beside\nDólokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way that\nDólokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He winked at him gaily,\nsmiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra screen.\n“How like the brother is to the sister,” remarked the count. “And how\nhandsome they both are!”\nShinshín, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some intrigue of\nKurágin’s in Moscow, and Natásha tried to overhear it just because he had"}, {"page": 785, "text": "said she was “charmante.”\nThe first act was over.

In the state of intoxication she was in, everything seemed simple and\nnatural.\nThe scantily clad Hélène smiled at everyone in the same way, and\nNatásha gave Borís a similar smile.\nHélène’s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most\ndistinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another in\ntheir wish to let everyone see that they knew her.\nDuring the whole of that entr’acte Kurágin stood with Dólokhov in front\nof the orchestra partition, looking at the Rostóvs’ box. Natásha knew he was\ntalking about her and this afforded her pleasure. She even turned so that he\nshould see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming aspect.\nBefore the beginning of the second act Pierre appeared in the stalls. The\nRostóvs had not seen him since their arrival. His face looked sad, and he\nhad grown still stouter since Natásha last saw him. He passed up to the front\nrows, not noticing anyone. Anatole went up to him and began speaking to\nhim, looking at and indicating the Rostóvs’ box. On seeing Natásha Pierre\ngrew animated and, hastily passing between the rows, came toward their\nbox. When he got there he leaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to her\nfor a long time. While conversing with Pierre, Natásha heard a man’s voice\nin Countess Bezúkhova’s box and something told her it was Kurágin. She\nturned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed straight into her eyes\nwith such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be so near\nhim, to look at him like that, to be so sure he admired her, and not to be\nacquainted with him.\nIn the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there was a\nround hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were raised over the\nfootlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many\npeople appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding things"}, {"page": 786, "text": "like daggers in their hands.

They did not drag her away at once, but sang\nwith her for a long time and then at last dragged her off, and behind the\nscenes something metallic was struck three times and everyone knelt down\nand sang a prayer. All these things were repeatedly interrupted by the\nenthusiastic shouts of the audience.\nDuring this act every time Natásha looked toward the stalls she saw\nAnatole Kurágin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair, staring at\nher. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did not\noccur to her that there was anything wrong in it.\nWhen the second act was over Countess Bezúkhova rose, turned to the\nRostóvs’ box—her whole bosom completely exposed—beckoned the old\ncount with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had\nentered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile.\n“Do make me acquainted with your charming daughters,” said she. “The\nwhole town is singing their praises and I don’t even know them!”\nNatásha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was so pleased by\npraise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure.\n“I want to become a Moscovite too, now,” said Hélène. “How is it you’re\nnot ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?”\nCountess Bezúkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating\nwoman. She could say what she did not think—especially what was\nflattering—quite simply and naturally.\n“Dear count, you must let me look after your daughters! Though I am not\nstaying here long this time—nor are you—I will try to amuse them. I have\nalready heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get to know you,”\nsaid she to Natásha with her stereotyped and lovely smile. “I had heard\nabout you from my page, Drubetskóy. Have you heard he is getting\nmarried? And also from my husband’s friend Bolkónski, Prince Andrew\nBolkónski,” she went on with special emphasis, implying that she knew of\nhis relation to Natásha. To get better acquainted she asked that one of the\nyoung ladies should come into her box for the rest of the performance, and\nNatásha moved over to it."}, {"page": 787, "text": "The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles\nwere burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the walls. In\nthe middle stood what were probably a king and a queen. The king waved\nhis right arm and, evidently nervous, sang something badly and sat down on\na crimson throne. The maiden who had been first in white and then in light\nblue, now wore only a smock, and stood beside the throne with her hair\ndown. She sang something mournfully, addressing the queen, but the king\nwaved his arm severely, and men and women with bare legs came in from\nboth sides and began dancing all together. Then the violins played very\nshrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick bare legs and thin\narms, separating from the others, went behind the wings, adjusted her\nbodice, returned to the middle of the stage, and began jumping and striking\none foot rapidly against the other. In the stalls everyone clapped and\nshouted “bravo!” Then one of the men went into a corner of the stage. The\ncymbals and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly, and this man\nwith bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet about very rapidly.

Once more there was a terrible noise and\nclatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone began\nshouting: “Duport! Duport! Duport!” Natásha no longer thought this\nstrange.

Anatole, who was as handsome at\nclose quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her and told her he had long\nwished to have this happiness—ever since the Narýshkins’ ball in fact, at\nwhich he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing her. Kurágin was\nmuch more sensible and simple with women than among men. He talked\nboldly and naturally, and Natásha was strangely and agreeably struck by the\nfact that there was nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so\nmuch talk, but that on the contrary his smile was most naïve, cheerful, and\ngood-natured.\nKurágin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a\nprevious performance Semënova had fallen down on the stage.\n“And do you know, Countess,” he said, suddenly addressing her as an\nold, familiar acquaintance, “we are getting up a costume tournament; you\nought to take part in it! It will be great fun. We shall all meet at the\nKarágins’! Please come! No! Really, eh?” said he.\nWhile saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face, her\nneck, and her bare arms. Natásha knew for certain that he was enraptured\nby her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel constrained and\noppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking at\nher shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should look\ninto hers rather than this. But looking into his eyes she was frightened,\nrealizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt"}, {"page": 789, "text": "between herself and other men.

When\nshe turned away she feared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm\nand kiss her on the neck. They spoke of most ordinary things, yet she felt\nthat they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man.\nNatásha kept turning to Hélène and to her father, as if asking what it all\nmeant, but Hélène was engaged in conversation with a general and did not\nanswer her look, and her father’s eyes said nothing but what they always\nsaid: “Having a good time? Well, I’m glad of it!”\nDuring one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatole’s\nprominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Natásha, to break the\nsilence, asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked the question and\nblushed. She felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing\nsomething improper. Anatole smiled as though to encourage her.\n“At first I did not like it much, because what makes a town pleasant ce\nsont les jolies femmes, * isn’t that so? But now I like it very much indeed,”\nhe said, looking at her significantly. “You’ll come to the costume\ntournament, Countess? Do come!” and putting out his hand to her bouquet\nand dropping his voice, he added, “You will be the prettiest there. Do come,\ndear countess, and give me this flower as a pledge!”\n* Are the pretty women.\nNatásha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did\nhimself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper\nintention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had not\nheard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she felt that he was\nthere, behind, so close behind her.\n“How is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?” she asked\nherself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She looked straight\ninto his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the good-natured\ntenderness of his smile vanquished her. She smiled just as he was doing,\ngazing straight into his eyes. And again she felt with horror that no barrier\nlay between him and her.\nThe curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay.

That was the only part of the fourth act that Natásha saw. She\nfelt agitated and tormented, and the cause of this was Kurágin whom she\ncould not help watching. As they were leaving the theater Anatole came up\nto them, called their carriage, and helped them in. As he was putting\nNatásha in he pressed her arm above the elbow. Agitated and flushed she\nturned round. He was looking at her with glittering eyes, smiling tenderly.\nOnly after she had reached home was Natásha able clearly to think over\nwhat had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince Andrew she\nwas horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera, she gave\na loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the room.\n“O God! I am lost!” she said to herself. “How could I let him?” She sat\nfor a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize what\nhad happened to her, but was unable either to understand what had\nhappened or what she felt.

What was that terror I felt of him? What is\nthis gnawing of conscience I am feeling now?” she thought.\nOnly to the old countess at night in bed could Natásha have told all she\nwas feeling. She knew that Sónya with her severe and simple views would\neither not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a confession. So\nNatásha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself.\n“Am I spoiled for Andrew’s love or not?” she asked herself, and with\nsoothing irony replied: “What a fool I am to ask that! What did happen to\nme? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didn’t lead him on at all. Nobody will\nknow and I shall never see him again,” she told herself. “So it is plain that\nnothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of, and Andrew can"}, {"page": 791, "text": "love me still.

And again in imagination she went\nover her whole conversation with Kurágin, and again saw the face, gestures,\nand tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm."}, {"page": 792, "text": "CHAPTER XI\nAnatole Kurágin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him\naway from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles\na year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more, which his\ncreditors demanded from his father.\nHis father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the\nlast time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to the\ncommander in chief—a post his father had procured for him—and would at\nlast try to make a good match there. He indicated to him Princess Mary and\nJulie Karágina.\nAnatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre’s\nhouse. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him after a\nwhile, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and gave him\nmoney under the guise of loans.\nAs Shinshín had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had\nturned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that he\nslighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French actresses—\nwith the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to be on\nintimate relations. He had never missed a carousal at Danílov’s or other\nMoscow revelers’, drank whole nights through, outvying everyone else, and\nwas at all the balls and parties of the best society. There was talk of his\nintrigues with some of the ladies, and he flirted with a few of them at the\nballs. But he did not run after the unmarried girls, especially the rich\nheiresses who were most of them plain. There was a special reason for this,\nas he had got married two years before—a fact known only to his most\nintimate friends. At that time while with his regiment in Poland, a Polish\nlandowner of small means had forced him to marry his daughter. Anatole\nhad very soon abandoned his wife and, for a payment which he agreed to\nsend to his father-in-law, had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a\nbachelor."}, {"page": 793, "text": "Anatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with\nothers.

He was convinced that, as a duck is so made that it must live\nin water, so God had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand\nrubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in society. He\nbelieved this so firmly that others, looking at him, were persuaded of it too\nand did not refuse him either a leading place in society or money, which he\nborrowed from anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay.\nHe was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning. He was\nnot vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still less could he be\naccused of ambition. More than once he had vexed his father by spoiling his\nown career, and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds. He was not mean,\nand did not refuse anyone who asked of him. All he cared about was gaiety\nand women, and as according to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in\nthese tastes, and he was incapable of considering what the gratification of\nhis tastes entailed for others, he honestly considered himself irreproachable,\nsincerely despised rogues and bad people, and with a tranquil conscience\ncarried his head high.\nRakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence similar\nto that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of\nforgiveness. “All will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all will be\nforgiven him, for he enjoyed much.”\nDólokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and\nhis Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling, and\ndissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kurágin and made\nuse of him for his own ends.\nAnatole was sincerely fond of Dólokhov for his cleverness and audacity.\nDólokhov, who needed Anatole Kurágin’s name, position, and connections\nas a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set, made use of him and\namused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it.

Márya Dmítrievna talked to the count about something which\nthey concealed from Natásha. Natásha guessed they were talking about the\nold prince and planning something, and this disquieted and offended her.\nShe was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice that day sent a\nmanservant to the Vozdvízhenka to ascertain whether he had come. He had\nnot arrived. She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow.\nTo her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant\nrecollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince, and a\nfear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause. She continually\nfancied that either he would never come or that something would happen to\nher before he came. She could no longer think of him by herself calmly and\ncontinuously as she had done before. As soon as she began to think of him,\nthe recollection of the old prince, of Princess Mary, of the theater, and of\nKurágin mingled with her thoughts. The question again presented itself\nwhether she was not guilty, whether she had not already broken faith with\nPrince Andrew, and again she found herself recalling to the minutest detail\nevery word, every gesture, and every shade in the play of expression on the\nface of the man who had been able to arouse in her such an\nincomprehensible and terrifying feeling. To the family Natásha seemed\nlivelier than usual, but she was far less tranquil and happy than before.\nOn Sunday morning Márya Dmítrievna invited her visitors to Mass at her\nparish church—the Church of the Assumption built over the graves of\nvictims of the plague.\n“I don’t like those fashionable churches,” she said, evidently priding\nherself on her independence of thought. “God is the same everywhere. We\nhave an excellent priest, he conducts the service decently and with dignity,\nand the deacon is the same. What holiness is there in giving concerts in the\nchoir?

But in nothing in the house was the holiday so\nnoticeable as in Márya Dmítrievna’s broad, stern face, which on that day\nwore an invariable look of solemn festivity.\nAfter Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room where\nthe loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a servant announced\nthat the carriage was ready, and Márya Dmítrievna rose with a stern air. She\nwore her holiday shawl, in which she paid calls, and announced that she\nwas going to see Prince Nicholas Bolkónski to have an explanation with\nhim about Natásha.\nAfter she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited\non the Rostóvs, and Natásha, very glad of this diversion, having shut herself\ninto a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying on the new\ndresses. Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and only tacked\ntogether, and was turning her head to see in the glass how the back fitted,\nshe heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of her father’s voice\nand another’s—a woman’s—that made her flush. It was Hélène. Natásha\nhad not time to take off the bodice before the door opened and Countess\nBezúkhova, dressed in a purple velvet gown with a high collar, came into\nthe room beaming with good-humored amiable smiles.\n“Oh, my enchantress!” she cried to the blushing Natásha. “Charming!\nNo, this is really beyond anything, my dear count,” said she to Count\nRostóv who had followed her in. “How can you live in Moscow and go\nnowhere? No, I won’t let you off!

Natásha brightened up and felt almost in love with this woman,\nwho was so beautiful and so kind. Hélène for her part was sincerely\ndelighted with Natásha and wished to give her a good time. Anatole had\nasked her to bring him and Natásha together, and she was calling on the\nRostóvs for that purpose. The idea of throwing her brother and Natásha\ntogether amused her.\nThough at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with Natásha\nfor drawing Borís away, she did not think of that now, and in her own way\nheartily wished Natásha well. As she was leaving the Rostóvs she called her\nprotégée aside.\n“My brother dined with me yesterday—we nearly died of laughter—he\nate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite\nmadly, in love with you, my dear.”\nNatásha blushed scarlet when she heard this.\n“How she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!” said Hélène. “You must\ncertainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a reason to\nshut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your fiancé would\nwish you to go into society rather than be bored to death.”\n“So she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierre—that good\nPierre—have talked and laughed about this. So it’s all right.” And again,\nunder Hélène’s influence, what had seemed terrible now seemed simple and\nnatural. “And she is such a grande dame, so kind, and evidently likes me so\nmuch.

There\nwere several Frenchmen present, among them Métivier who from the time\nHélène reached Moscow had been an intimate in her house.

Later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let her go to\nthe dressing room to rearrange her dress, that Hélène had followed her and\nspoken laughingly of her brother’s love, and that she again met Anatole in\nthe little sitting room. Hélène had disappeared leaving them alone, and\nAnatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice:\n“I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never see you? I\nlove you madly. Can I never...?” and, blocking her path, he brought his face\nclose to hers.\nHis large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw\nnothing but them.\n“Natalie?” he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being\npainfully pressed. “Natalie?”\n“I don’t understand. I have nothing to say,” her eyes replied.\nBurning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant she felt herself\nreleased, and Hélène’s footsteps and the rustle of her dress were heard in\nthe room. Natásha looked round at her, and then, red and trembling, threw a\nfrightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved toward the door.\n“One word, just one, for God’s sake!” cried Anatole.\nShe paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to her\nwhat had happened and to which she could find no answer.\n“Natalie, just a word, only one!” he kept repeating, evidently not\nknowing what to say and he repeated it till Hélène came up to them.\nHélène returned with Natásha to the drawing room. The Rostóvs went\naway without staying for supper.\nAfter reaching home Natásha did not sleep all night. She was tormented\nby the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince Andrew. She\nloved Prince Andrew—she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved\nhim. But she also loved Anatole, of that there was no doubt. “Else how\ncould all this have happened?” thought she. “If, after that, I could return his\nsmile when saying good-by, if I was able to let it come to that, it means that"}, {"page": 802, "text": "I loved him from the first. It means that he is kind, noble, and splendid, and\nI could not help loving him. What am I to do if I love him and the other one\ntoo?” she asked herself, unable to find an answer to these terrible questions."}, {"page": 803, "text": "CHAPTER XIV\nMorning came with its cares and bustle. Everyone got up and began to\nmove about and talk, dressmakers came again. Márya Dmítrievna appeared,\nand they were called to breakfast. Natásha kept looking uneasily at\neverybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept every glance\ndirected toward her, and tried to appear the same as usual.\nAfter breakfast, which was her best time, Márya Dmítrievna sat down in\nher armchair and called Natásha and the count to her.\n“Well, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is my\nadvice,” she began. “Yesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince\nBolkónski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to begin\nshouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had to say!”\n“Well, and he?” asked the count.\n“He? He’s crazy... he did not want to listen. But what’s the use of\ntalking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out,” said Márya Dmítrievna.\n“My advice to you is finish your business and go back home to Otrádnoe...\nand wait there.”\n“Oh, no!” exclaimed Natásha.\n“Yes, go back,” said Márya Dmítrievna, “and wait there. If your\nbetrothed comes here now—there will be no avoiding a quarrel; but alone\nwith the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you.”\nCount \nRostóv \napproved \nof \nthis \nsuggestion, \nappreciating \nits\nreasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the better to visit\nhim in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding, against his\nwishes, could only be arranged at Otrádnoe.\n“That is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took her,”\nsaid the old count."}, {"page": 804, "text": "“No, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But if he\nwon’t—that’s his affair,” said Márya Dmítrievna, looking for something in\nher reticule. “Besides, the trousseau is ready, so there is nothing to wait for;\nand what is not ready I’ll send after you. Though I don’t like letting you go,\nit is the best way. So go, with God’s blessing!”\nHaving found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to\nNatásha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.\n“She has written to you. How she torments herself, poor thing! She’s\nafraid you might think that she does not like you.”\n“But she doesn’t like me,” said Natásha.\n“Don’t talk nonsense!” cried Márya Dmítrievna.\n“I shan’t believe anyone, I know she doesn’t like me,” replied Natásha\nboldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed a cold and angry\nresolution that caused Márya Dmítrievna to look at her more intently and to\nfrown.\n“Don’t answer like that, my good girl!” she said. “What I say is true!\nWrite an answer!”\nNatásha did not reply and went to her own room to read Princess Mary’s\nletter.\nPrincess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that\nhad occurred between them. Whatever her father’s feelings might be, she\nbegged Natásha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one\nchosen by her brother, for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice\neverything.\n“Do not think, however,” she wrote, “that my father is ill-disposed\ntoward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven; but he\nis good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy.”\nPrincess Mary went on to ask Natásha to fix a time when she could see her\nagain.\nAfter reading the letter Natásha sat down at the writing table to answer it.\n“Dear Princess,” she wrote in French quickly and mechanically, and then\npaused. What more could she write after all that had happened the evening\nbefore? “Yes, yes! All that has happened, and now all is changed,” she\nthought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her. “Must I break"}, {"page": 805, "text": "off with him? Must I really? That’s awful...” and to escape from these\ndreadful thoughts she went to Sónya and began sorting patterns with her.\nAfter dinner Natásha went to her room and again took up Princess\nMary’s letter. “Can it be that it is all over?” she thought. “Can it be that all\nthis has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before?” She\nrecalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its former strength, and at the\nsame time felt that she loved Kurágin. She vividly pictured herself as Prince\nAndrew’s wife, and the scenes of happiness with him she had so often\nrepeated in her imagination, and at the same time, aglow with excitement,\nrecalled every detail of yesterday’s interview with Anatole.\n“Why could that not be as well?” she sometimes asked herself in\ncomplete bewilderment. “Only so could I be completely happy; but now I\nhave to choose, and I can’t be happy without either of them. Only,” she\nthought, “to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it from him\nare both equally impossible. But with that one nothing is spoiled. But am I\nreally to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew’s love, in which I have\nlived so long?”\n“Please, Miss!” whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious\nair. “A man told me to give you this—” and she handed Natásha a letter.\n“Only, for Christ’s sake...” the girl went on, as Natásha, without thinking,\nmechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from Anatole, of which,\nwithout taking in a word, she understood only that it was a letter from him\n—from the man she loved. Yes, she loved him, or else how could that have\nhappened which had happened? And how could she have a love letter from\nhim in her hand?\nWith trembling hands Natásha held that passionate love letter which\nDólokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she found in it an\necho of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.\n“Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you or\nto die. There is no other way for me,” the letter began. Then he went on to\nsay that he knew her parents would not give her to him—for this there were\nsecret reasons he could reveal only to her—but that if she loved him she\nneed only say the word yes, and no human power could hinder their bliss.\nLove would conquer all. He would steal her away and carry her off to the\nends of the earth."}, {"page": 806, "text": "“Yes, yes! I love him!” thought Natásha, reading the letter for the\ntwentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of\nit.\nThat evening Márya Dmítrievna was going to the Akhárovs’ and\nproposed to take the girls with her. Natásha, pleading a headache, remained\nat home."}, {"page": 807, "text": "CHAPTER XV\nOn returning late in the evening Sónya went to Natásha’s room, and to\nher surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa. Open on the\ntable, beside her lay Anatole’s letter. Sónya picked it up and read it.\nAs she read she glanced at the sleeping Natásha, trying to find in her face\nan explanation of what she was reading, but did not find it. Her face was\ncalm, gentle, and happy. Clutching her breast to keep herself from choking,\nSónya, pale and trembling with fear and agitation, sat down in an armchair\nand burst into tears.\n“How was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she have left\noff loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let Kurágin go to such\nlengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, that’s plain! What will Nicholas,\ndear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is the meaning of her\nexcited, resolute, unnatural look the day before yesterday, yesterday, and\ntoday,” thought Sónya. “But it can’t be that she loves him! She probably\nopened the letter without knowing who it was from. Probably she is\noffended by it. She could not do such a thing!”\nSónya wiped away her tears and went up to Natásha, again scanning her\nface.\n“Natásha!” she said, just audibly.\nNatásha awoke and saw Sónya.\n“Ah, you’re back?”\nAnd with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of\nawakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing Sónya’s look of\nembarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.\n“Sónya, you’ve read that letter?” she demanded.\n“Yes,” answered Sónya softly.\nNatásha smiled rapturously."}, {"page": 808, "text": "“No, Sónya, I can’t any longer!” she said. “I can’t hide it from you any\nlonger. You know, we love one another! Sónya, darling, he writes...\nSónya...”\nSónya stared open-eyed at Natásha, unable to believe her ears.\n“And Bolkónski?” she asked.\n“Ah, Sónya, if you only knew how happy I am!” cried Natásha. “You\ndon’t know what love is....”\n“But, Natásha, can that be all over?”\nNatásha looked at Sónya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp\nthe question.\n“Well, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew?” said Sónya.\n“Oh, you don’t understand anything! Don’t talk nonsense, just listen!”\nsaid Natásha, with momentary vexation.\n“But I can’t believe it,” insisted Sónya. “I don’t understand. How is it\nyou have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly... Why, you have only\nseen him three times! Natásha, I don’t believe you, you’re joking! In three\ndays to forget everything and so...”\n“Three days?” said Natásha. “It seems to me I’ve loved him a hundred\nyears. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You can’t\nunderstand it.... Sónya, wait a bit, sit here,” and Natásha embraced and\nkissed her.\n“I had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it too, but\nit’s only now that I feel such love. It’s not the same as before. As soon as I\nsaw him I felt he was my master and I his slave, and that I could not help\nloving him. Yes, his slave! Whatever he orders I shall do. You don’t\nunderstand that. What can I do? What can I do, Sónya?” cried Natásha with\na happy yet frightened expression.\n“But think what you are doing,” cried Sónya. “I can’t leave it like this.\nThis secret correspondence... How could you let him go so far?” she went\non, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal.\n“I told you that I have no will,” Natásha replied. “Why can’t you\nunderstand? I love him!”\n“Then I won’t let it come to that... I shall tell!” cried Sónya, bursting into\ntears."}, {"page": 809, "text": "“What do you mean? For God’s sake... If you tell, you are my enemy!”\ndeclared Natásha. “You want me to be miserable, you want us to be\nseparated....”\nWhen she saw Natásha’s fright, Sónya shed tears of shame and pity for\nher friend.\n“But what has happened between you?” she asked. “What has he said to\nyou? Why doesn’t he come to the house?”\nNatásha did not answer her questions.\n“For God’s sake, Sónya, don’t tell anyone, don’t torture me,” Natásha\nentreated. “Remember no one ought to interfere in such matters! I have\nconfided in you....”\n“But why this secrecy? Why doesn’t he come to the house?” asked\nSónya. “Why doesn’t he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince\nAndrew gave you complete freedom—if it is really so; but I don’t believe\nit! Natásha, have you considered what these secret reasons can be?”\nNatásha looked at Sónya with astonishment. Evidently this question\npresented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how to\nanswer it.\n“I don’t know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!”\nSónya sighed and shook her head incredulously.\n“If there were reasons...” she began.\nBut Natásha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.\n“Sónya, one can’t doubt him! One can’t, one can’t! Don’t you\nunderstand?” she cried.\n“Does he love you?”\n“Does he love me?” Natásha repeated with a smile of pity at her friend’s\nlack of comprehension. “Why, you have read his letter and you have seen\nhim.”\n“But if he is dishonorable?”\n“He! dishonorable? If you only knew!” exclaimed Natásha.\n“If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or cease\nseeing you; and if you won’t do this, I will. I will write to him, and I will\ntell Papa!” said Sónya resolutely."}, {"page": 810, "text": "“But I can’t live without him!” cried Natásha.\n“Natásha, I don’t understand you. And what are you saying! Think of\nyour father and of Nicholas.”\n“I don’t want anyone, I don’t love anyone but him. How dare you say he\nis dishonorable? Don’t you know that I love him?” screamed Natásha. “Go\naway, Sónya! I don’t want to quarrel with you, but go, for God’s sake go!\nYou see how I am suffering!” Natásha cried angrily, in a voice of despair\nand repressed irritation. Sónya burst into sobs and ran from the room.\nNatásha went to the table and without a moment’s reflection wrote that\nanswer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all the\nmorning. In this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were\nat an end; that availing herself of the magnanimity of Prince Andrew who\nwhen he went abroad had given her her freedom, she begged Princess Mary\nto forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward her,\nbut that she could not be his wife. At that moment this all seemed quite\neasy, simple, and clear to Natásha.\nOn Friday the Rostóvs were to return to the country, but on Wednesday\nthe count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow.\nOn the day the count left, Sónya and Natásha were invited to a big dinner\nparty at the Karágins’, and Márya Dmítrievna took them there. At that party\nNatásha again met Anatole, and Sónya noticed that she spoke to him, trying\nnot to be overheard, and that all through dinner she was more agitated than\never. When they got home Natásha was the first to begin the explanation\nSónya expected.\n“There, Sónya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,”\nNatásha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be\npraised. “We have had an explanation today.”\n“Well, what happened? What did he say? Natásha, how glad I am you’re\nnot angry with me! Tell me everything—the whole truth. What did he say?”\nNatásha became thoughtful.\n“Oh, Sónya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked me what I had\npromised Bolkónski. He was glad I was free to refuse him.”\nSónya sighed sorrowfully."}, {"page": 811, "text": "“But you haven’t refused Bolkónski?” said she.\n“Perhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkónski. Why do\nyou think so badly of me?”\n“I don’t think anything, only I don’t understand this...”\n“Wait a bit, Sónya, you’ll understand everything. You’ll see what a man\nhe is! Now don’t think badly of me or of him. I don’t think badly of anyone:\nI love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?”\nSónya did not succumb to the tender tone Natásha used toward her. The\nmore emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natásha’s face became,\nthe more serious and stern grew Sónya’s.\n“Natásha,” said she, “you asked me not to speak to you, and I haven’t\nspoken, but now you yourself have begun. I don’t trust him, Natásha. Why\nthis secrecy?”\n“Again, again!” interrupted Natásha.\n“Natásha, I am afraid for you!”\n“Afraid of what?”\n“I am afraid you’re going to your ruin,” said Sónya resolutely, and was\nherself horrified at what she had said.\nAnger again showed in Natásha’s face.\n“And I’ll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! It’s not your business!\nIt won’t be you, but I, who’ll suffer. Leave me alone, leave me alone! I hate\nyou!”\n“Natásha!” moaned Sónya, aghast.\n“I hate you, I hate you! You’re my enemy forever!” And Natásha ran out\nof the room.\nNatásha did not speak to Sónya again and avoided her. With the same\nexpression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house, taking up\nnow one occupation, now another, and at once abandoning them.\nHard as it was for Sónya, she watched her friend and did not let her out\nof her sight.\nThe day before the count was to return, Sónya noticed that Natásha sat by\nthe drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and\nthat she made a sign to an officer who drove past, whom Sónya took to be\nAnatole."}, {"page": 812, "text": "Sónya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at\ndinner and all that evening Natásha was in a strange and unnatural state.\nShe answered questions at random, began sentences she did not finish, and\nlaughed at everything.\nAfter tea Sónya noticed a housemaid at Natásha’s door timidly waiting to\nlet her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at the door learned that\nanother letter had been delivered.\nThen suddenly it became clear to Sónya that Natásha had some dreadful\nplan for that evening. Sónya knocked at her door. Natásha did not let her in.\n“She will run away with him!” thought Sónya. “She is capable of\nanything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face\ntoday. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,” Sónya remembered. “Yes,\nthat’s it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?” thought she,\nrecalling all the signs that clearly indicated that Natásha had some terrible\nintention. “The count is away. What am I to do? Write to Kurágin\ndemanding an explanation? But what is there to oblige him to reply? Write\nto Pierre, as Prince Andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune?... But\nperhaps she really has already refused Bolkónski—she sent a letter to\nPrincess Mary yesterday. And Uncle is away....” To tell Márya Dmítrievna\nwho had such faith in Natásha seemed to Sónya terrible. “Well, anyway,”\nthought Sónya as she stood in the dark passage, “now or never I must prove\nthat I remember the family’s goodness to me and that I love Nicholas. Yes!\nIf I don’t sleep for three nights I’ll not leave this passage and will hold her\nback by force and will and not let the family be disgraced,” thought she."}, {"page": 813, "text": "CHAPTER XVI\nAnatole had lately moved to Dólokhov’s. The plan for Natalie Rostóva’s\nabduction had been arranged and the preparations made by Dólokhov a few\ndays before, and on the day that Sónya, after listening at Natásha’s door,\nresolved to safeguard her, it was to have been put into execution. Natásha\nhad promised to come out to Kurágin at the back porch at ten that evening.\nKurágin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive her\nforty miles to the village of Kámenka, where an unfrocked priest was in\nreadiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them. At Kámenka a relay\nof horses was to wait which would take them to the Warsaw highroad, and\nfrom there they would hasten abroad with post horses.\nAnatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand rubles he\nhad taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with\nDólokhov’s help.\nTwo witnesses for the mock marriage—Khvóstikov, a retired petty\nofficial whom Dólokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and\nMakárin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an unbounded\naffection for Kurágin—were sitting at tea in Dólokhov’s front room.\nIn his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with\nPersian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat Dólokhov in a traveling cloak and\nhigh boots, at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles of\npaper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to and fro from the\nroom where the witnesses were sitting, through the study to the room\nbehind, where his French valet and others were packing the last of his\nthings. Dólokhov was counting the money and noting something down.\n“Well,” he said, “Khvóstikov must have two thousand.”\n“Give it to him, then,” said Anatole.\n“Makárka” (their name for Makárin) “will go through fire and water for\nyou for nothing. So here are our accounts all settled,” said Dólokhov,"}, {"page": 814, "text": "showing him the memorandum. “Is that right?”\n“Yes, of course,” returned Anatole, evidently not listening to Dólokhov\nand looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his face.\nDólokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an\nironic smile:\n“Do you know? You’d really better drop it all. There’s still time!”\n“Fool,” retorted Anatole. “Don’t talk nonsense! If you only knew... it’s\nthe devil knows what!”\n“No, really, give it up!” said Dólokhov. “I am speaking seriously. It’s no\njoke, this plot you’ve hatched.”\n“What, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?” said Anatole, making a\ngrimace. “Really it’s no time for your stupid jokes,” and he left the room.\nDólokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole\nhad gone out.\n“You wait a bit,” he called after him. “I’m not joking, I’m talking sense.\nCome here, come here!”\nAnatole returned and looked at Dólokhov, trying to give him his attention\nand evidently submitting to him involuntarily.\n“Now listen to me. I’m telling you this for the last time. Why should I\njoke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for you? Who\nfound the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I did it all.”\n“Well, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?” And Anatole\nsighed and embraced Dólokhov.\n“I helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a dangerous\nbusiness, and if you think about it—a stupid business. Well, you’ll carry her\noff—all right! Will they let it stop at that? It will come out that you’re\nalready married. Why, they’ll have you in the criminal court....”\n“Oh, nonsense, nonsense!” Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace.\n“Didn’t I explain to you? What?” And Anatole, with the partiality dull-\nwitted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own\nreasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to Dólokhov a hundred\ntimes. “Didn’t I explain to you that I have come to this conclusion: if this\nmarriage is invalid,” he went on, crooking one finger, “then I have nothing"}, {"page": 815, "text": "to answer for; but if it is valid, no matter! Abroad no one will know\nanything about it. Isn’t that so? And don’t talk to me, don’t, don’t.”\n“Seriously, you’d better drop it! You’ll only get yourself into a mess!”\n“Go to the devil!” cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the room, but\nreturned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of Dólokhov with his\nfeet turned under him. “It’s the very devil! What? Feel how it beats!” He\ntook Dólokhov’s hand and put it on his heart. “What a foot, my dear fellow!\nWhat a glance! A goddess!” he added in French. “What?”\nDólokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes\nlooked at him—evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him.\n“Well and when the money’s gone, what then?”\n“What then? Eh?” repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed by a thought of\nthe future. “What then?... Then, I don’t know.... But why talk nonsense!” He\nglanced at his watch. “It’s time!”\nAnatole went into the back room.\n“Now then! Nearly ready? You’re dawdling!” he shouted to the servants.\nDólokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to\nbring something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went into\nthe room where Khvóstikov and Makárin were sitting.\nAnatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling\npensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself.\n“Come and eat something. Have a drink!” Dólokhov shouted to him from\nthe other room.\n“I don’t want to,” answered Anatole continuing to smile.\n“Come! Balagá is here.”\nAnatole rose and went into the dining room. Balagá was a famous troyka\ndriver who had known Dólokhov and Anatole some six years and had given\nthem good service with his troykas. More than once when Anatole’s\nregiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the evening,\nbrought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again the next\nnight. More than once he had enabled Dólokhov to escape when pursued.\nMore than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies and\n“ladykins” as he called the cocottes. More than once in their service he had\nrun over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of Moscow and had"}, {"page": 816, "text": "always been protected from the consequences by “my gentlemen” as he\ncalled them. He had ruined more than one horse in their service. More than\nonce they had beaten him, and more than once they had made him drunk on\nchampagne and Madeira, which he loved; and he knew more than one thing\nabout each of them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to\nSiberia. They often called Balagá into their orgies and made him drink and\ndance at the gypsies’, and more than one thousand rubles of their money\nhad passed through his hands. In their service he risked his skin and his life\ntwenty times a year, and in their service had lost more horses than the\nmoney he had from them would buy. But he liked them; liked that mad\ndriving at twelve miles an hour, liked upsetting a driver or running down a\npedestrian, and flying at full gallop through the Moscow streets. He liked to\nhear those wild, tipsy shouts behind him: “Get on! Get on!” when it was\nimpossible to go any faster. He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to\nsome peasant who, more dead than alive, was already hurrying out of his\nway. “Real gentlemen!” he considered them.\nAnatole and Dólokhov liked Balagá too for his masterly driving and\nbecause he liked the things they liked. With others Balagá bargained,\ncharging twenty-five rubles for a two hours’ drive, and rarely drove himself,\ngenerally letting his young men do so. But with “his gentlemen” he always\ndrove himself and never demanded anything for his work. Only a couple of\ntimes a year—when he knew from their valets that they had money in hand\n—he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow would\nask them to help him. The gentlemen always made him sit down.\n“Do help me out, Theodore Iványch, sir,” or “your excellency,” he would\nsay. “I am quite out of horses.

Yet some fate constantly\nthrew them together.\n“What can have happened? And what can they want with me?” thought\nhe as he dressed to go to Márya Dmítrievna’s. “If only Prince Andrew\nwould hurry up and come and marry her!” thought he on his way to the\nhouse.\nOn the Tverskóy Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.\n“Pierre! Been back long?” someone shouted. Pierre raised his head. In a\nsleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the\ndashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion Makárin dashed\npast. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military dandies, the\nlower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his head slightly bent.\nHis face was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat, tilted to one side,\ndisclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled with powdery snow.\n“Yes, indeed, that’s a true sage,” thought Pierre. “He sees nothing beyond\nthe pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so he is always\ncheerful, satisfied, and serene.

That Prince Andrew’s deeply\nloved affianced wife—the same Natásha Rostóva who used to be so\ncharming—should give up Bolkónski for that fool Anatole who was already\nsecretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in love with him as to\nagree to run away with him, was something Pierre could not conceive and\ncould not imagine.\nHe could not reconcile the charming impression he had of Natásha,\nwhom he had known from a child, with this new conception of her\nbaseness, folly, and cruelty. He thought of his wife. “They are all alike!” he\nsaid to himself, reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate enough\nto be tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied Prince Andrew to the point of\ntears and sympathized with his wounded pride, and the more he pitied his\nfriend the more did he think with contempt and even with disgust of that\nNatásha who had just passed him in the ballroom with such a look of cold\ndignity. He did not know that Natásha’s soul was overflowing with despair,\nshame, and humiliation, and that it was not her fault that her face happened\nto assume an expression of calm dignity and severity.\n“But how get married?” said Pierre, in answer to Márya Dmítrievna. “He\ncould not marry—he is married!”"}, {"page": 828, "text": "“Things get worse from hour to hour!” ejaculated Márya Dmítrievna. “A\nnice youth!

She was afraid that the count or Bolkónski,\nwho might arrive at any moment, if they knew of this affair (which she\nhoped to hide from them) might challenge Anatole to a duel, and she\ntherefore asked Pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to leave\nMoscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierre—only now\nrealizing the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince Andrew—\npromised to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly explained her\nwishes to him, she let him go to the drawing room.\n“Mind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing either,”\nshe said. “And I will go and tell her it is no use expecting him! And stay to\ndinner if you care to!” she called after Pierre.\nPierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset.

I do so regret having come\nhere.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she has broken off her\nengagement without consulting anybody? It’s true this engagement never\nwas much to my liking. Of course he is an excellent man, but still, with his\nfather’s disapproval they wouldn’t have been happy, and Natásha won’t\nlack suitors. Still, it has been going on so long, and to take such a step\nwithout father’s or mother’s consent! And now she’s ill, and God knows\nwhat!

They are armed against you by the same experience of\ndebauchery; but to promise a maid to marry her... to deceive, to kidnap....\nDon’t you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man or a child?...”\nPierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with a\nquestioning look.\n“I don’t know about that, eh?” said Anatole, growing more confident as\nPierre mastered his wrath. “I don’t know that and don’t want to,” he said,\nnot looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw, “but you\nhave used such words to me—‘mean’ and so on—which as a man of honor I\ncan’t allow anyone to use.”\nPierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he\nwanted.\n“Though it was tête-à-tête,” Anatole continued, “still I can’t...”\n“Is it satisfaction you want?” said Pierre ironically."}, {"page": 833, "text": "“You could at least take back your words.

The whole house was\nin a state of alarm and commotion. Natásha was very ill, having, as Márya\nDmítrievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the night after she had been\ntold that Anatole was married, with some arsenic she had stealthily\nprocured. After swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she woke\nSónya and told her what she had done. The necessary antidotes had been\nadministered in time and she was now out of danger, though still so weak\nthat it was out of the question to move her to the country, and so the\ncountess had been sent for.

Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost the same\nstate as Natásha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room\nto hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some\nintrigue going on in Petersburg. The old prince’s voice and another now and\nthen interrupted him. Princess Mary came out to meet Pierre. She sighed,\nlooking toward the door of the room where Prince Andrew was, evidently\nintending to express her sympathy with his sorrow, but Pierre saw by her\nface that she was glad both at what had happened and at the way her brother\nhad taken the news of Natásha’s faithlessness.\n“He says he expected it,” she remarked. “I know his pride will not let\nhim express his feelings, but still he has taken it better, far better, than I\nexpected. Evidently it had to be....”\n“But is it possible that all is really ended?” asked Pierre.\nPrincess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not understand\nhow he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the study. Prince\nAndrew, greatly changed and plainly in better health, but with a fresh\nhorizontal wrinkle between his brows, stood in civilian dress facing his\nfather and Prince Meshchérski, warmly disputing and vigorously\ngesticulating. The conversation was about Speránski—the news of whose\nsudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow.\n“Now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him\na month ago,” Prince Andrew was saying, “and by those who were unable\nto understand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on\nhim all the blame of other men’s mistakes is very easy, but I maintain that if\nanything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him, by\nhim alone.”\nHe paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and immediately\nassumed a vindictive expression.\n“Posterity will do him justice,” he concluded, and at once turned to\nPierre.\n“Well, how are you?

Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his son’s tutor,\nPrince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about Speránski\nwhich was still going on between the two old men.\n“If there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon, they\nwould have been made public,” he said with warmth and haste. “I do not,\nand never did, like Speránski personally, but I like justice!”\nPierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too\nfamiliar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in\norder to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate. When\nPrince Meshchérski had left, Prince Andrew took Pierre’s arm and asked\nhim into the room that had been assigned him. A bed had been made up\nthere, and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about. Prince Andrew\nwent to one and took out a small casket, from which he drew a packet\nwrapped in paper. He did it all silently and very quickly. He stood up and\ncoughed. His face was gloomy and his lips compressed.\n“Forgive me for troubling you....”\nPierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Natásha, and his\nbroad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated Prince\nAndrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he continued:\n“I have received a refusal from Countess Rostóva and have heard reports\nof your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that kind. Is\nthat true?”\n“Both true and untrue,” Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him.\n“Here are her letters and her portrait,” said he.\nHe took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.\n“Give this to the countess... if you see her.”\n“She is very ill,” said Pierre.\n“Then she is here still?” said Prince Andrew. “And Prince Kurágin?” he\nadded quickly."}, {"page": 837, "text": "“He left long ago.

But I don’t know,” said Pierre.\n“Well, it doesn’t matter,” said Prince Andrew. “Tell Countess Rostóva\nthat she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is good.”\nPierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether\nhe had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say\nanything, looked fixedly at him.\n“I say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?” asked Pierre,\n“about...”\n“Yes,” returned Prince Andrew hastily. “I said that a fallen woman should\nbe forgiven, but I didn’t say I could forgive her. I can’t.”\n“But can this be compared...?” said Pierre.\nPrince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: “Yes, ask her hand\nagain, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very noble, but I\nam unable to follow in that gentleman’s footsteps. If you wish to be my\nfriend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well, good-by. So you’ll give\nher the packet?”\nPierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary.\nThe old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same as\nalways, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed her\nsatisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at them\nPierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the Rostóvs,\nand that it was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of her\nwho could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else.\nAt dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was\nbecoming evident.

Natásha was in bed, the count at the club, and Pierre, after\ngiving the letters to Sónya, went to Márya Dmítrievna who was interested\nto know how Prince Andrew had taken the news. Ten minutes later Sónya\ncame to Márya Dmítrievna.\n“Natásha insists on seeing Count Peter Kirílovich,” said she.\n“But how? Are we to take him up to her?

On the twelfth of June, 1812, the forces of\nWestern Europe crossed the Russian frontier and war began, that is, an\nevent took place opposed to human reason and to human nature.

What were its causes? The\nhistorians tell us with naïve assurance that its causes were the wrongs\ninflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the Continental\nSystem, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of Alexander, the mistakes\nof the diplomatists, and so on.\nConsequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich,\nRumyántsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have\ntaken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for Napoleon to have\nwritten to Alexander: “My respected Brother, I consent to restore the duchy\nto the Duke of Oldenburg”—and there would have been no war.\nWe can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries. It\nnaturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by England’s\nintrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St. Helena). It naturally seemed\nto members of the English Parliament that the cause of the war was\nNapoleon’s ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg, that the cause of the war\nwas the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the war was\nthe Continental System which was ruining Europe; to the generals and old\nsoldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them"}, {"page": 846, "text": "employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of re-\nestablishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of that time that it all\nresulted from the fact that the alliance between Russia and Austria in 1809\nhad not been sufficiently well concealed from Napoleon, and from the\nawkward wording of Memorandum No. 178. It is natural that these and a\ncountless and infinite quantity of other reasons, the number depending on\nthe endless diversity of points of view, presented themselves to the men of\nthat day; but to us, to posterity who view the thing that happened in all its\nmagnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem\ninsufficient. To us it is incomprehensible that millions of Christian men\nkilled and tortured each other either because Napoleon was ambitious or\nAlexander was firm, or because England’s policy was astute or the Duke of\nOldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances\nhave with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the Duke\nwas wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed and\nruined the people of Smolénsk and Moscow and were killed by them.\nTo us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried away\nby the process of research and can therefore regard the event with\nunclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present\nthemselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them\nwe find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us\nequally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the\nmagnitude of the events, and by its impotence—apart from the cooperation\nof all the other coincident causes—to occasion the event. To us, the wish or\nobjection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as\nmuch a cause as Napoleon’s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the\nVistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to\nserve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also\nrefused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon’s army and\nthe war could not have occurred.\nHad Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw\nbeyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have\nbeen no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term\nthen also there could have been no war.

But in order to begin negotiations, what\nis demanded of me?” he said, frowning and making an energetic gesture of\ninquiry with his small white plump hand.\n“The withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,” replied\nBalashëv.\n“The Niemen?” repeated Napoleon. “So now you want me to retire\nbeyond the Niemen—only the Niemen?” repeated Napoleon, looking\nstraight at Balashëv.\nThe latter bowed his head respectfully.\nInstead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from\nPomerania, only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded.\nNapoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room.\n“You say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen\nbefore commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months ago\nthe demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder,\nand yet you are willing to negotiate.”"}, {"page": 869, "text": "He went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again\nstopped in front of Balashëv. Balashëv noticed that his left leg was\nquivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern\nexpression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was\nconscious of. “The vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,” he\nremarked at a later date.\n“Such demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be made to\na Prince of Baden, but not to me!” Napoleon almost screamed, quite to his\nown surprise. “If you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept\nsuch conditions. You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his\narmy? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I\nhave expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when\nyour position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the aim\nof your alliance with England? What has she given you?” he continued\nhurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace and\ndiscuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and power and\nAlexander’s errors and duplicity.\nThe commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the\nintention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing that\nhe was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking, and the\nmore he talked the less could he control his words.\nThe whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and\ninsult Alexander—just what he had least desired at the commencement of\nthe interview.\n“I hear you have made peace with Turkey?”\nBalashëv bowed his head affirmatively.\n“Peace has been concluded...” he began.\nBut Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all the\ntalking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and\nunrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone.\n“Yes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining\nMoldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those\nprovinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,” he went on, “I promised and would\nhave given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now he\nwon’t have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united them to his"}, {"page": 870, "text": "empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia from the Gulf of\nBothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the Great could not have\ndone more,” said Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he paced up\nand down the room, repeating to Balashëv almost the very words he had\nused to Alexander himself at Tilsit. “All that, he would have owed to my\nfriendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!” he repeated several times, then\npaused, drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to his nose, and\ngreedily sniffed at it.\n“What a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander’s might have been!”\nHe looked compassionately at Balashëv, and as soon as the latter tried to\nmake some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.\n“What could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through\nmy friendship?” demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders in perplexity.\n“But no, he has preferred to surround himself with my enemies, and with\nwhom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and Wintzingerodes! Stein, a\ntraitor expelled from his own country; Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer;\nWintzingerode, a fugitive French subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a\nsoldier than the others, but all the same an incompetent who was unable to\ndo anything in 1807 and who should awaken terrible memories in the\nEmperor Alexander’s mind.... Granted that were they competent they might\nbe made use of,” continued Napoleon—hardly able to keep pace in words\nwith the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and\nstrong he was (in his perception the two were one and the same)—“but they\nare not even that! They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to\nbe the most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his first\nmovements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel proposes,\nArmfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called on to act, does\nnot know what to decide on, and time passes bringing no result. Bagratión\nalone is a military man. He’s stupid, but he has experience, a quick eye, and\nresolution.... And what role is your young monarch playing in that\nmonstrous crowd? They compromise him and throw on him the\nresponsibility for all that happens. A sovereign should not be with the army\nunless he is a general!” said Napoleon, evidently uttering these words as a\ndirect challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander desired to be a\nmilitary commander."}, {"page": 871, "text": "“The campaign began only a week ago, and you haven’t even been able\nto defend Vílna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of the Polish\nprovinces. Your army is grumbling.”\n“On the contrary, Your Majesty,” said Balashëv, hardly able to remember\nwhat had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with\ndifficulty, “the troops are burning with eagerness...”\n“I know everything!” Napoleon interrupted him. “I know everything. I\nknow the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You have\nnot two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number. I give\nyou my word of honor,” said Napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor\ncould carry no weight—“I give you my word of honor that I have five\nhundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will be\nof no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making\npeace with you. As for the Swedes—it is their fate to be governed by mad\nkings. Their king was insane and they changed him for another—\nBernadotte, who promptly went mad—for no Swede would ally himself\nwith Russia unless he were mad.”\nNapoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose.\nBalashëv knew how to reply to each of Napoleon’s remarks, and would\nhave done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say\nsomething, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the alleged insanity of\nthe Swedes, Balashëv wished to reply that when Russia is on her side\nSweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation to\ndrown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man\nhas to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is in the right.\nBalashëv began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his\ndignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank before\nthe transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon. He\nknew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any significance,\nand that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his\nsenses. Balashëv stood with downcast eyes, looking at the movements of\nNapoleon’s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes.\n“But what do I care about your allies?” said Napoleon. “I have allies—\nthe Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions. And\nthere will be two hundred thousand of them.”"}, {"page": 872, "text": "And probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this\nobvious falsehood, and that Balashëv still stood silently before him in the\nsame attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned round, drew\nclose to Balashëv’s face, and, gesticulating rapidly and energetically with\nhis white hands, almost shouted:\n“Know that if you stir up Prussia against me, I’ll wipe it off the map of\nEurope!” he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and he struck\none of his small hands energetically with the other. “Yes, I will throw you\nback beyond the Dvína and beyond the Dnieper, and will re-erect against\nyou that barrier which it was criminal and blind of Europe to allow to be\ndestroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to you. That is what you have\ngained by alienating me!” And he walked silently several times up and\ndown the room, his fat shoulders twitching.\nHe put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, lifted it\nseveral times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balashëv. He paused,\nlooked ironically straight into Balashëv’s eyes, and said in a quiet voice:\n“And yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!”\nBalashëv, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the Russian\nside things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon was silent, still\nlooking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him. Balashëv said\nthat in Russia the best results were expected from the war. Napoleon\nnodded condescendingly, as if to say, “I know it’s your duty to say that, but\nyou don’t believe it yourself. I have convinced you.”\nWhen Balashëv had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed\nat it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. The door opened, a\ngentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully, handed the Emperor his hat and\ngloves; another brought him a pocket handkerchief. Napoleon, without\ngiving them a glance, turned to Balashëv:\n“Assure the Emperor Alexander from me,” said he, taking his hat, “that I\nam as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very highly\nesteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer, General; you shall\nreceive my letter to the Emperor.”\nAnd Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception room\nrushed forward and descended the staircase."}, {"page": 873, "text": "CHAPTER VII\nAfter all that Napoleon had said to him—those bursts of anger and the\nlast dryly spoken words: “I will detain you no longer, General; you shall\nreceive my letter,” Balashëv felt convinced that Napoleon would not wish\nto see him, and would even avoid another meeting with him—an insulted\nenvoy—especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger. But, to his\nsurprise, Balashëv received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine with the\nEmperor that day.\nBessières, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.\nNapoleon met Balashëv cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed no\nsign of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning,\nbut, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balashëv. It was evident that he had\nlong been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake, and\nthat in his perception whatever he did was right, not because it harmonized\nwith any idea of right and wrong, but because he did it.\nThe Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through Vílna, where\ncrowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him. From all the\nwindows of the streets through which he rode, rugs, flags, and his\nmonogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies, welcoming him, waved\ntheir handkerchiefs to him.\nAt dinner, having placed Balashëv beside him, Napoleon not only treated\nhim amiably but behaved as if Balashëv were one of his own courtiers, one\nof those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his success.\nIn the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and questioned\nBalashëv about the Russian capital, not merely as an interested traveler asks\nabout a new city he intends to visit, but as if convinced that Balashëv, as a\nRussian, must be flattered by his curiosity.\n“How many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it\ntrue that Moscow is called ‘Holy Moscow’? How many churches are there"}, {"page": 874, "text": "in Moscow?” he asked.\nAnd receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches,\nhe remarked:\n“Why such a quantity of churches?”\n“The Russians are very devout,” replied Balashëv.\n“But a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the\nbackwardness of a people,” said Napoleon, turning to Caulaincourt for\nappreciation of this remark.\nBalashëv respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.\n“Every country has its own character,” said he.\n“But nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,” said Napoleon.\n“I beg your Majesty’s pardon,” returned Balashëv, “besides Russia there\nis Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.”\nThis reply of Balashëv’s, which hinted at the recent defeats of the French\nin Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at Alexander’s court, but\nit was not much appreciated at Napoleon’s dinner, where it passed\nunnoticed.\nThe uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they\nwere puzzled as to what Balashëv’s tone suggested. “If there is a point we\ndon’t see it, or it is not at all witty,” their expressions seemed to say. So\nlittle was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not notice it at all and\nnaïvely asked Balashëv through what towns the direct road from there to\nMoscow passed. Balashëv, who was on the alert all through the dinner,\nreplied that just as “all roads lead to Rome,” so all roads lead to Moscow:\nthere were many roads, and “among them the road through Poltáva, which\nCharles XII chose.” Balashëv involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the\naptitude of this reply, but hardly had he uttered the word Poltáva before\nCaulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from Petersburg to\nMoscow and of his Petersburg reminiscences.\nAfter dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon’s study, which four\ndays previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander. Napoleon sat\ndown, toying with his Sèvres coffee cup, and motioned Balashëv to a chair\nbeside him."}, {"page": 875, "text": "Napoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than\nany reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to\nconsider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was surrounded by\nmen who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after his dinner, Balashëv\ntoo was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned to him with a pleasant,\nthough slightly ironic, smile.\n“They tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied? Strange,\nisn’t it, General?” he said, evidently not doubting that this remark would be\nagreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his, Napoleon’s, superiority to\nAlexander.\nBalashëv made no reply and bowed his head in silence.\n“Yes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were\ndeliberating,” continued Napoleon with the same derisive and self-confident\nsmile. “What I can’t understand,” he went on, “is that the Emperor\nAlexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies. That I do\nnot... understand. Has he not thought that I may do the same?” and he\nturned inquiringly to Balashëv, and evidently this thought turned him back\non to the track of his morning’s anger, which was still fresh in him.\n“And let him know that I will do so!” said Napoleon, rising and pushing\nhis cup away with his hand. “I’ll drive all his Württemberg, Baden, and\nWeimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. I’ll drive them out. Let him\nprepare an asylum for them in Russia!”\nBalashëv bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to\nmake his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help\nhearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression; he\ntreated Balashëv not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man now fully\ndevoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master’s humiliation.\n“And why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies?\nWhat is the good of that? War is my profession, but his business is to reign\nand not to command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a\nresponsibility?”\nAgain Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up and\ndown the room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly, went up to\nBalashëv and with a slight smile, as confidently, quickly, and simply as if he\nwere doing something not merely important but pleasing to Balashëv, he"}, {"page": 876, "text": "raised his hand to the forty-year-old Russian general’s face and, taking him\nby the ear, pulled it gently, smiling with his lips only.\nTo have one’s ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest\nhonor and mark of favor at the French court.\n“Well, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why don’t you say\nanything?” said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be the adorer\nand courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon. “Are the horses ready for the\ngeneral?” he added, with a slight inclination of his head in reply to\nBalashëv’s bow. “Let him have mine, he has a long way to go!”\nThe letter taken by Balashëv was the last Napoleon sent to Alexander.\nEvery detail of the interview was communicated to the Russian monarch,\nand the war began...."}, {"page": 877, "text": "CHAPTER VIII\nAfter his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to\nPetersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet Anatole\nKurágin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching Petersburg he\ninquired for Kurágin but the latter had already left the city. Pierre had\nwarned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on his track. Anatole\nKurágin promptly obtained an appointment from the Minister of War and\nwent to join the army in Moldavia. While in Petersburg Prince Andrew met\nKutúzov, his former commander who was always well disposed toward\nhim, and Kutúzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in\nMoldavia, to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief.\nSo Prince Andrew, having received an appointment on the headquarters\nstaff, left for Turkey.\nPrince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge Kurágin. He\nthought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might\ncompromise the young Countess Rostóva and so he wanted to meet Kurágin\npersonally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel. But he again failed to\nmeet Kurágin in Turkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived, the latter\nreturned to Russia. In a new country, amid new conditions, Prince Andrew\nfound life easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken faith with him—\nwhich he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects—the\nsurroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him, and the\nfreedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so.\nNot only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as\nhe lay gazing at the sky on the field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged\nupon with Pierre, and which had filled his solitude at Boguchárovo and then\nin Switzerland and Rome, but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright\nand boundless horizons they had revealed.

It was as if that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once\ntowered above him had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed\nhim down, in which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.\nOf the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was the\nsimplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on Kutúzov’s staff, he\napplied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised\nKutúzov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not having found\nKurágin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to\nRussia after him, but all the same he knew that however long it might be\nbefore he met Kurágin, despite his contempt for him and despite all the\nproofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a\nconflict with him—he knew that when he did meet him he would not be\nable to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help\nsnatching at food. And the consciousness that the insult was not yet\navenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and\npoisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in Turkey by\nmeans of restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity.\nIn the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached\nBucharest—where Kutúzov had been living for two months, passing his\ndays and nights with a Wallachian woman—Prince Andrew asked Kutúzov\nto transfer him to the Western Army. Kutúzov, who was already weary of\nBolkónski’s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very\nreadily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.\nBefore joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at\nDrissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way,\nbeing only two miles off the Smolénsk highroad. During the last three years\nthere had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt, and seen so\nmuch (having traveled both in the east and the west), that on reaching Bald\nHills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there\nunchanged and still the same in every detail. He entered through the gates\nwith their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he\nwere entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the\nsame cleanliness, the same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the\nsame furniture, the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces,\nonly somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the same timid, plain maiden\ngetting on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of her life"}, {"page": 879, "text": "in fear and constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same\ncoquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her existence and\nfull of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become more self-\nconfident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had brought from\nSwitzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and talking broken Russian\nto the servants, but was still the same narrowly intelligent, conscientious,\nand pedantic preceptor. The old prince had changed in appearance only by\nthe loss of a tooth, which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in\ncharacter he was the same as ever, only showing still more irritability and\nskepticism as to what was happening in the world. Little Nicholas alone had\nchanged. He had grown, become rosier, had curly dark hair, and, when\nmerry and laughing, quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty\nlittle mouth just as the little princess used to do. He alone did not obey the\nlaw of immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. But though externally\nall remained as of old, the inner relations of all these people had changed\nsince Prince Andrew had seen them last. The household was divided into\ntwo alien and hostile camps, who changed their habits for his sake and only\nmet because he was there. To the one camp belonged the old prince,\nMademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other Princess Mary,\nDessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and maids.\nDuring his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but they were\nill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an\nexception was being made and that his presence made them all feel\nawkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day, he was\ntaciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb and\nretired to his apartments directly after dinner. In the evening, when Prince\nAndrew went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to tell him of the\nyoung Count Kámensky’s campaign, the old prince began unexpectedly to\ntalk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her superstitions and her dislike\nof Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said, was the only person really\nattached to him.\nThe old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess\nMary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by indulgence\nand silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The old prince knew\nvery well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was very hard, but\nhe also knew that he could not help tormenting her and that she deserved it.\n“Why does Prince Andrew, who sees this, say nothing to me about his"}, {"page": 880, "text": "sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an old fool who, without any\nreason, keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this\nFrenchwoman to himself? He doesn’t understand, so I must explain it, and\nhe must hear me out,” thought the old prince. And he began explaining why\nhe could not put up with his daughter’s unreasonable character.\n“If you ask me,” said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was\ncensuring his father for the first time in his life), “I did not wish to speak\nabout it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank opinion. If there is any\nmisunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I can’t blame her for\nit at all. I know how she loves and respects you. Since you ask me,”\ncontinued Prince Andrew, becoming irritable—as he was always liable to\ndo of late—“I can only say that if there are any misunderstandings they are\ncaused by that worthless woman, who is not fit to be my sister’s\ncompanion.”\nThe old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural smile\ndisclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew could not\nget accustomed.\n“What companion, my dear boy? Eh? You’ve already been talking it\nover! Eh?”\n“Father, I did not want to judge,” said Prince Andrew, in a hard and bitter\ntone, “but you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall say, that\nMary is not to blame, but those to blame—the one to blame—is that\nFrenchwoman.”\n“Ah, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!” said the old man in a\nlow voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment,\nbut then he suddenly jumped up and cried: “Be off, be off! Let not a trace of\nyou remain here!...”\nPrince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded him\nto stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did not leave his\nroom and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne and Tíkhon, but\nasked several times whether his son had gone. Next day, before leaving,\nPrince Andrew went to his son’s rooms. The boy, curly-headed like his\nmother and glowing with health, sat on his knee, and Prince Andrew began\ntelling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell into a reverie without finishing\nthe story. He thought not of this pretty child, his son whom he held on his"}, {"page": 881, "text": "knee, but of himself. He sought in himself either remorse for having\nangered his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on\nbad terms with him, and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more\nto him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness\nfor his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking\nhim on his knee.\n“Well, go on!” said his son.\nPrince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went\nout of the room.\nAs soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and\nespecially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been\nhappy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity, and he\nhastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon as\npossible.\n“So you’ve decided to go, Andrew?” asked his sister.\n“Thank God that I can,” replied Prince Andrew. “I am very sorry you\ncan’t.”\n“Why do you say that?” replied Princess Mary. “Why do you say that,\nwhen you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle\nBourienne says he has been asking about you....”\nAs soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears\nbegan to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the room.\n“Ah, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what—what trash—\ncan cause people misery!” he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess\nMary.\nShe understood that when speaking of “trash” he referred not only to\nMademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who\nhad ruined his own happiness.\n“Andrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!” she said, touching his elbow\nand looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. “I understand\nyou” (she looked down). “Don’t imagine that sorrow is the work of men.\nMen are His tools.” She looked a little above Prince Andrew’s head with the\nconfident, accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a\nfamiliar portrait hangs. “Sorrow is sent by Him, not by men. Men are His\ninstruments, they are not to blame. If you think someone has wronged you,"}, {"page": 882, "text": "forget it and forgive! We have no right to punish. And then you will know\nthe happiness of forgiving.”\n“If I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman’s virtue. But a\nman should not and cannot forgive and forget,” he replied, and though till\nthat moment he had not been thinking of Kurágin, all his unexpended anger\nsuddenly swelled up in his heart.\n“If Mary is already persuading me to forgive, it means that I ought long\nago to have punished him,” he thought. And giving her no further reply, he\nbegan thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet Kurágin\nwho he knew was now in the army.\nPrincess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she knew\nhow unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being reconciled\nto him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably soon be back\nagain from the army and would certainly write to his father, but that the\nlonger he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become.\n“Good-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and\nmen are never to blame,” were the last words he heard from his sister when\nhe took leave of her.\n“Then it must be so!” thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the\navenue from the house at Bald Hills. “She, poor innocent creature, is left to\nbe victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits. The old man feels\nhe is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is growing up and rejoices\nin life, in which like everybody else he will deceive or be deceived. And I\nam off to the army. Why? I myself don’t know. I want to meet that man\nwhom I despise, so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me!”\nThese conditions of life had been the same before, but then they were all\nconnected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only senseless things,\nlacking coherence, presented themselves one after another to Prince\nAndrew’s mind."}, {"page": 883, "text": "CHAPTER IX\nPrince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of\nJune. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied the fortified\ncamp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying to effect a junction\nwith the first one from which it was said to be cut off by large French\nforces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the general course of affairs in the\nRussian army, but no one anticipated any danger of invasion of the Russian\nprovinces, and no one thought the war would extend farther than the\nwestern, the Polish, provinces.\nPrince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned,\non the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large village in\nthe vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals and courtiers\naccompanying the army were living in the best houses of the villages on\nboth sides of the river, over a radius of six miles. Barclay de Tolly was\nquartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He received Bolkónski\nstiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he would mention\nhim to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment, but asked him\nmeanwhile to remain on his staff. Anatole Kurágin, whom Prince Andrew\nhad hoped to find with the army, was not there. He had gone to Petersburg,\nbut Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His mind was occupied by the\ninterests of the center that was conducting a gigantic war, and he was glad\nto be free for a while from the distraction caused by the thought of Kurágin.\nDuring the first four days, while no duties were required of him, Prince\nAndrew rode round the whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own\nknowledge and by talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion about\nit. But the question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous\nremained for him undecided. Already from his military experience and what\nhe had seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come to the conclusion that in\nwar the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all\ndepends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy—that cannot be"}, {"page": 884, "text": "foreseen—are met, and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled.\nTo clear up this last point for himself, Prince Andrew, utilizing his position\nand acquaintances, tried to fathom the character of the control of the army\nand of the men and parties engaged in it, and he deduced for himself the\nfollowing of the state of affairs.\nWhile the Emperor had still been at Vílna, the forces had been divided\ninto three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the army\nunder Bagratión, and thirdly, the one commanded by Tormásov. The\nEmperor was with the first army, but not as commander in chief. In the\norders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor would take command, but\nonly that he would be with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had with him\nnot a commander in chief’s staff but the imperial headquarters staff. In\nattendance on him was the head of the imperial staff, Quartermaster General\nPrince Volkónski, as well as generals, imperial aides-de-camp, diplomatic\nofficials, and a large number of foreigners, but not the army staff. Besides\nthese, there were in attendance on the Emperor without any definite\nappointments: Arakchéev, the ex-Minister of War; Count Bennigsen, the\nsenior general in rank; the Grand Duke Tsarévich Constantine Pávlovich;\nCount Rumyántsev, the Chancellor; Stein, a former Prussian minister;\nArmfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel, the chief author of the plan of\ncampaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general and Sardinian émigré; Wolzogen—\nand many others. Though these men had no military appointment in the\narmy, their position gave them influence, and often a corps commander, or\neven the commander in chief, did not know in what capacity he was\nquestioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke, Arakchéev, or Prince Volkónski,\nor was given this or that advice and did not know whether a certain order\nreceived in the form of advice emanated from the man who gave it or from\nthe Emperor and whether it had to be executed or not. But this was only the\nexternal condition; the essential significance of the presence of the Emperor\nand of all these people, from a courtier’s point of view (and in an Emperor’s\nvicinity all became courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this: the\nEmperor did not assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of all\nthe armies; the men around him were his assistants. Arakchéev was a\nfaithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereign’s bodyguard.\nBennigsen was a landlord in the Vílna province who appeared to be doing\nthe honors of the district, but was in reality a good general, useful as an\nadviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke was there"}, {"page": 885, "text": "because it suited him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there because his\nadvice was useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high esteem\npersonally. Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general full of\nself-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander. Paulucci was\nthere because he was bold and decided in speech. The adjutants general\nwere there because they always accompanied the Emperor, and lastly and\nchiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up the plan of campaign\nagainst Napoleon and, having induced Alexander to believe in the efficacy\nof that plan, was directing the whole business of the war. With Pfuel was\nWolzogen, who expressed Pfuel’s thoughts in a more comprehensible way\nthan Pfuel himself (who was a harsh, bookish theorist, self-confident to the\npoint of despising everyone else) was able to do.\nBesides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and\nunexpected ideas every day—especially the foreigners, who did so with a\nboldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their own—\nthere were many secondary personages accompanying the army because\ntheir principals were there.\nAmong the opinions and voices in this immense, restless, brilliant, and\nproud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following sharply defined\nsubdivisions of tendencies and parties:\nThe first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents—military theorists\nwho believed in a science of war with immutable laws—laws of oblique\nmovements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents demanded a\nretirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise laws\ndefined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only barbarism, ignorance,\nor evil intention in every deviation from that theory. To this party belonged\nthe foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and others, chiefly Germans.\nThe second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as\nalways happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of\nthis party were those who had demanded an advance from Vílna into Poland\nand freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being advocates of bold\naction, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still\nmore one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: Bagratión, Ermólov\n(who was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that time a famous\njoke of Ermólov’s was being circulated, that as a great favor he had\npetitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party,"}, {"page": 886, "text": "remembering Suvórov, said that what one had to do was not to reason, or\nstick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of Russia,\nand not let the army get discouraged.\nTo the third party—in which the Emperor had most confidence—\nbelonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other\ntwo. The members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakchéev\nbelonged, thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to\nseem to have some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war,\nparticularly against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte\nnow), needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge\nand in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be\nacknowledged that the theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one\nshould not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel’s\nopponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and then\nchoose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the camp at\nDrissa, according to Pfuel’s plan, but on changing the movements of the\nother armies. Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other could be\nattained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party.\nOf a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the\nTsarévich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, where he\nhad ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and cavalry uniform\nas to a review, expecting to crush the French gallantly; but unexpectedly\nfinding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid the general\nconfusion. The men of this party had both the quality and the defect of\nfrankness in their opinions. They feared Napoleon, recognized his strength\nand their own weakness, and frankly said so. They said: “Nothing but\nsorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this! We have abandoned Vílna\nand Vítebsk and shall abandon Drissa. The only reasonable thing left to do\nis to conclude peace as soon as possible, before we are turned out of\nPetersburg.”\nThis view was very general in the upper army circles and found support\nalso in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumyántsev, who, for other\nreasons of state, was in favor of peace.\nThe fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay de\nTolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in chief.\n“Be he what he may” (they always began like that), “he is an honest,"}, {"page": 887, "text": "practical man and we have nobody better. Give him real power, for war\ncannot be conducted successfully without unity of command, and he will\nshow what he can do, as he did in Finland. If our army is well organized\nand strong and has withdrawn to Drissa without suffering any defeats, we\nowe this entirely to Barclay. If Barclay is now to be superseded by\nBennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his incapacity already in\n1807.”\nThe sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at any rate\nthere was no one more active and experienced than Bennigsen: “and twist\nabout as you may, you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually. Let the\nothers make mistakes now!” said they, arguing that our retirement to Drissa\nwas a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders. “The more\nmistakes that are made the better. It will at any rate be understood all the\nsooner that things cannot go on like this. What is wanted is not some\nBarclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen, who made his mark in 1807,\nand to whom Napoleon himself did justice—a man whose authority would\nbe willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the only such man.”\nThe seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be\nfound, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there were\nparticularly many round Alexander—generals and imperial aides-de-camp\npassionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a monarch but as a man,\nadoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as Rostóv had done in 1805, and\nwho saw in him not only all the virtues but all human capabilities as well.\nThese men, though enchanted with the sovereign for refusing the command\nof the army, yet blamed him for such excessive modesty, and only desired\nand insisted that their adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and\nopenly announce that he would place himself at the head of the army, gather\nround him a commander in chief’s staff, and, consulting experienced\ntheoreticians and practical men where necessary, would himself lead the\ntroops, whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest pitch.\nThe eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to the\nothers as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither peace\nnor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa or anywhere\nelse, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor Bennigsen, but only\nthe one most essential thing—as much advantage and pleasure for\nthemselves as possible. In the troubled waters of conflicting and"}, {"page": 888, "text": "intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperor’s headquarters, it was\npossible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times. A man who\nsimply wished to retain his lucrative post would today agree with Pfuel,\ntomorrow with his opponent, and the day after, merely to avoid\nresponsibility or to please the Emperor, would declare that he had no\nopinion at all on the matter. Another who wished to gain some advantage\nwould attract the Emperor’s attention by loudly advocating the very thing\nthe Emperor had hinted at the day before, and would dispute and shout at\nthe council, beating his breast and challenging those who did not agree with\nhim to duels, thereby proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for\nthe common good. A third, in the absence of opponents, between two\ncouncils would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services,\nwell knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him.\nA fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come\naccidentally under the Emperor’s eye. A fifth, to achieve his long-cherished\naim of dining with the Emperor, would stubbornly insist on the correctness\nor falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this object would\nproduce arguments more or less forcible and correct.\nAll the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, and\npromotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial\nfavor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole drone\npopulation of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it was all the\nharder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the uncertainties of the\nposition, with the menace of serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening\ncharacter to everything, amid this vortex of intrigue, egotism, conflict of\nviews and feelings, and the diversity of race among these people—this\neighth and largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests\nimparted great confusion and obscurity to the common task. Whatever\nquestion arose, a swarm of these drones, without having finished their\nbuzzing on a previous theme, flew over to the new one and by their hum\ndrowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly.\nFrom among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached the\narmy, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning to raise\nits voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men experienced and\ncapable in state affairs, who, without sharing any of those conflicting\nopinions, were able to take a detached view of what was going on at the"}, {"page": 889, "text": "staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this muddle,\nindecision, intricacy, and weakness.\nThe men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted\nchiefly from the Emperor’s presence in the army with his military court and\nfrom the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional, and\nunsteady fluctuation of relations, which is in place at court but harmful in\nan army; that a sovereign should reign but not command the army, and that\nthe only way out of the position would be for the Emperor and his court to\nleave the army; that the mere presence of the Emperor paralyzed the action\nof fifty thousand men required to secure his personal safety, and that the\nworst commander in chief, if independent, would be better than the very\nbest one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch.\nJust at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa,\nShishkóv, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives of this\nparty, wrote a letter to the Emperor which Arakchéev and Balashëv agreed\nto sign. In this letter, availing himself of permission given him by the\nEmperor to discuss the general course of affairs, he respectfully suggested\n—on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike\nspirit in the people of the capital—that the Emperor should leave the army.\nThat arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to\ndefend their country—the very incitement which was the chief cause of\nRussia’s triumph in so far as it was produced by the Tsar’s personal\npresence in Moscow—was suggested to the Emperor, and accepted by him,\nas a pretext for quitting the army."}, {"page": 890, "text": "CHAPTER X\nThis letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when Barclay, one\nday at dinner, informed Bolkónski that the sovereign wished to see him\npersonally, to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrew was to\npresent himself at Bennigsen’s quarters at six that evening.\nNews was received at the Emperor’s quarters that very day of a fresh\nmovement by Napoleon which might endanger the army—news\nsubsequently found to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had\nridden round the Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had pointed out\nto him that this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel, and till then considered\na chef-d’oeuvre of tactical science which would ensure Napoleon’s\ndestruction, was an absurdity, threatening the destruction of the Russian\narmy.\nPrince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen’s quarters—a country gentleman’s\nhouse of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river. Neither\nBennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chernýshev, the Emperor’s aide-\nde-camp, received Bolkónski and informed him that the Emperor,\naccompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had gone a\nsecond time that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp, of the\nsuitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt.\nChernýshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French novel\nin his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was still an\norgan in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one corner stood the\nfolding bedstead of Bennigsen’s adjutant. This adjutant was also there and\nsat dozing on the rolled-up bedding, evidently exhausted by work or by\nfeasting. Two doors led from the room, one straight on into what had been\nthe drawing room, and another, on the right, to the study. Through the first\ndoor came the sound of voices conversing in German and occasionally in\nFrench. In that drawing room were gathered, by the Emperor’s wish, not a\nmilitary council (the Emperor preferred indefiniteness), but certain persons"}, {"page": 891, "text": "whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending difficulties. It\nwas not a council of war, but, as it were, a council to elucidate certain\nquestions for the Emperor personally. To this semicouncil had been invited\nthe Swedish General Armfeldt, Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode\n(whom Napoleon had referred to as a renegade French subject), Michaud,\nToll, Count Stein who was not a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who,\nas Prince Andrew had heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. Prince\nAndrew had an opportunity of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived\nsoon after himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a\nminute to speak to Chernýshev.\nAt first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general, which\nfitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince Andrew,\nthough he saw him now for the first time. There was about him something\nof Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German theorist-\ngenerals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more typical\nthan any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German theorist in\nwhom all the characteristics of those others were united to such an extent.\nPfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust build,\nbroad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face was much\nwrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been hastily brushed\nsmooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in quaint little tufts. He\nentered the room, looking restlessly and angrily around, as if afraid of\neverything in that large apartment. Awkwardly holding up his sword, he\naddressed Chernýshev and asked in German where the Emperor was. One\ncould see that he wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as possible,\nfinish with the bows and greetings, and sit down to business in front of a\nmap, where he would feel at home. He nodded hurriedly in reply to\nChernýshev, and smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was\ninspecting the fortifications that he, Pfuel, had planned in accord with his\ntheory. He muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice, as\nself-assured Germans do—it might have been “stupid fellow”... or “the\nwhole affair will be ruined,” or “something absurd will come of it.”...\nPrince Andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed on, but\nChernýshev introduced him to Pfuel, remarking that Prince Andrew was\njust back from Turkey where the war had terminated so fortunately.

From this short interview with Pfuel, Prince Andrew,\nthanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to form a clear conception of\nthe man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably self-confident\nmen, self-confident to the point of martyrdom as only Germans are, because\nonly Germans are self-confident on the basis of an abstract notion—science,\nthat is, the supposed knowledge of absolute truth. A Frenchman is self-\nassured because he regards himself personally, both in mind and body, as\nirresistibly attractive to men and women. An Englishman is self-assured, as\nbeing a citizen of the best-organized state in the world, and therefore as an\nEnglishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as\nan Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because he\nis excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian is self-\nassured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything,\nsince he does not believe that anything can be known. The German’s self-\nassurance is worst of all, stronger and more repulsive than any other,\nbecause he imagines that he knows the truth—science—which he himself\nhas invented but which is for him the absolute truth.\nPfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science—the theory of oblique\nmovements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Great’s wars,\nand all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him\nabsurd and barbarous—monstrous collisions in which so many blunders\nwere committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars, they\ndid not accord with the theory, and therefore could not serve as material for\nscience.\nIn 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of\ncampaign that ended in Jena and Auerstädt, but he did not see the least\nproof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war. On the\ncontrary, the deviations made from his theory were, in his opinion, the sole\ncause of the whole disaster, and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he\nwould remark, “There, I said the whole affair would go to the devil!” Pfuel\nwas one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight\nof the theory’s object—its practical application.

The unbrushed tufts of hair\nsticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed\nthis most eloquently.\nHe passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of his\nvoice were at once heard from there."}, {"page": 894, "text": "CHAPTER XI\nPrince Andrew’s eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when\nCount Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolkónski, but not\npausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he went.\nThe Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened on to make\nsome preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign. Chernýshev and\nPrince Andrew went out into the porch, where the Emperor, who looked\nfatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to him with\nparticular warmth and the Emperor, with his head bent to the left, was\nlistening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward evidently\nwishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited Italian,\noblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.\n“And as for the man who advised forming this camp—the Drissa camp,”\nsaid Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince\nAndrew scanned his unfamiliar face, “as to that person, sire...” continued\nPaulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain himself, “the man who\nadvised the Drissa camp—I see no alternative but the lunatic asylum or the\ngallows!”\nWithout heeding the end of the Italian’s remarks, and as though not\nhearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolkónski, addressed him\ngraciously.\n“I am very glad to see you!

He came out of the study into the drawing\nroom with some maps which he spread on a table, and put questions on\nwhich he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present. What had\nhappened was that news (which afterwards proved to be false) had been\nreceived during the night of a movement by the French to outflank the\nDrissa camp.\nThe first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty that\npresented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from\nthe Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was inexplicable\n(unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an opinion), but he urged\nthat at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy. It was\nplain that Armfeldt had thought out that plan long ago and now expounded\nit not so much to answer the questions put—which, in fact, his plan did not\nanswer—as to avail himself of the opportunity to air it. It was one of the\nmillions of proposals, one as good as another, that could be made as long as\nit was quite unknown what character the war would take. Some disputed his\narguments, others defended them. Young Count Toll objected to the\nSwedish general’s views more warmly than anyone else, and in the course\nof the dispute drew from his side pocket a well-filled notebook, which he\nasked permission to read to them. In these voluminous notes Toll suggested\nanother scheme, totally different from Armfeldt’s or Pfuel’s plan of\ncampaign. In answer to Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack,\nwhich, he urged, could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and\nfrom the trap (as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.\nDuring all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen (his\n“bridge” in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted contemptuously\nand turned away, to show that he would never demean himself by replying\nto such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when Prince Volkónski, who\nwas in the chair, called on him to give his opinion, he merely said:\n“Why ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with\nan exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentleman’s attack—very fine, or a\nretreat, also good! Why ask me?” said he. “Why, you yourselves know\neverything better than I do.”\nBut when Volkónski said, with a frown, that it was in the Emperor’s\nname that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly growing animated,"}, {"page": 896, "text": "began to speak:\n“Everything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody thought\nthey knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How mend matters?\nThere is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me must be strictly\nadhered to,” said he, drumming on the table with his bony fingers. “What is\nthe difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!”\nHe went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no\neventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that everything\nhad been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really going to outflank it,\nthe enemy would inevitably be destroyed.\nPaulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in French.\nWolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French badly, and\nbegan translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with Pfuel, who was\nrapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened, but all that could\nhappen, had been foreseen in his scheme, and that if there were now any\ndifficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan had not been\nprecisely executed. He kept laughing sarcastically, he demonstrated, and at\nlast contemptuously ceased to demonstrate, like a mathematician who\nceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a problem that has already\nbeen proved. Wolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in\nFrench, every now and then turning to Pfuel and saying, “Is it not so, your\nexcellency?” But Pfuel, like a man heated in a fight who strikes those on his\nown side, shouted angrily at his own supporter, Wolzogen:\n“Well, of course, what more is there to explain?”\nPaulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in French.\nArmfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to Volkónski in\nRussian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.\nOf all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry,\ndetermined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those present,\nevidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no hatred\nagainst anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a theory arrived at\nby years of toil, should be carried out. He was ridiculous, and unpleasantly\nsarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion\nto an idea. Besides this, the remarks of all except Pfuel had one common\ntrait that had not been noticeable at the council of war in 1805: there was\nnow a panic fear of Napoleon’s genius, which, though concealed, was"}, {"page": 897, "text": "noticeable in every rejoinder. Everything was assumed to be possible for\nNapoleon, they expected him from every side, and invoked his terrible\nname to shatter each other’s proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to consider\nNapoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his theory. But\nbesides this feeling of respect, Pfuel evoked pity in Prince Andrew. From\nthe tone in which the courtiers addressed him and the way Paulucci had\nallowed himself to speak of him to the Emperor, but above all from a\ncertain desperation in Pfuel’s own expressions, it was clear that the others\nknew, and Pfuel himself felt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-\nconfidence and grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair\nsmoothly brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he\nconcealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was evidently\nin despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his theory by a huge\nexperiment and proving its soundness to the whole world was slipping away\nfrom him.\nThe discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted the\nmore heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and personalities,\nand the less was it possible to arrive at any general conclusion from all that\nhad been said. Prince Andrew, listening to this polyglot talk and to these\nsurmises, plans, refutations, and shouts, felt nothing but amazement at what\nthey were saying. A thought that had long since and often occurred to him\nduring his military activities—the idea that there is not and cannot be any\nscience of war, and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military\ngenius—now appeared to him an obvious truth. “What theory and science is\npossible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are\nunknown and cannot be defined, especially when the strength of the acting\nforces cannot be ascertained? No one was or is able to foresee in what\ncondition our or the enemy’s armies will be in a day’s time, and no one can\ngauge the force of this or that detachment. Sometimes—when there is not a\ncoward at the front to shout, ‘We are cut off!’ and start running, but a brave\nand jolly lad who shouts, ‘Hurrah!’—a detachment of five thousand is\nworth thirty thousand, as at Schön Grabern, while at times fifty thousand\nrun from eight thousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can there be in a\nmatter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing can be defined and\neverything depends on innumerable conditions, the significance of which is\ndetermined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when?\nArmfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci says we have got the"}, {"page": 898, "text": "French army between two fires; Michaud says that the worthlessness of the\nDrissa camp lies in having the river behind it, and Pfuel says that is what\nconstitutes its strength; Toll proposes one plan, Armfeldt another, and they\nare all good and all bad, and the advantages of any suggestions can be seen\nonly at the moment of trial. And why do they all speak of a ‘military\ngenius’? Is a man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right\ntime and say who is to go to the right and who to the left? It is only because\nmilitary men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants\nflatter power, attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. The\nbest generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded\nmen. Bagratión was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that. And of\nBonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the field of\nAusterlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any special\nqualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and best\nhuman attributes—love, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic inquiring\ndoubt. He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he is doing is very\nimportant (otherwise he will not have sufficient patience), and only then\nwill he be a brave leader. God forbid that he should be humane, should love,\nor pity, or think of what is just and unjust. It is understandable that a theory\nof their ‘genius’ was invented for them long ago because they have power!\nThe success of a military action depends not on them, but on the man in the\nranks who shouts, ‘We are lost!’ or who shouts, ‘Hurrah!’ And only in the\nranks can one serve with assurance of being useful.”\nSo thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he roused\nhimself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.\nAt the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he\nwould like to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court circles\nforever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign’s person, but for\npermission to serve in the army."}, {"page": 899, "text": "CHAPTER XII\nBefore the beginning of the campaign, Rostóv had received a letter from\nhis parents in which they told him briefly of Natásha’s illness and the\nbreaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they explained by\nNatásha’s having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas to retire from the\narmy and return home. On receiving this letter, Nicholas did not even make\nany attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the army, but wrote to\nhis parents that he was sorry Natásha was ill and her engagement broken\noff, and that he would do all he could to meet their wishes. To Sónya he\nwrote separately.\n“Adored friend of my soul!” he wrote. “Nothing but honor could keep me\nfrom returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of the\ncampaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comrades’ eyes but in\nmy own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the\nFatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe me, directly the\nwar is over, if I am still alive and still loved by you, I will throw up\neverything and fly to you, to press you forever to my ardent breast.”\nIt was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that prevented\nRostóv from returning home as he had promised and marrying Sónya. The\nautumn in Otrádnoe with the hunting, and the winter with the Christmas\nholidays and Sónya’s love, had opened out to him a vista of tranquil rural\njoys and peace such as he had never known before, and which now allured\nhim. “A splendid wife, children, a good pack of hounds, a dozen leashes of\nsmart borzois, agriculture, neighbors, service by election...” thought he. But\nnow the campaign was beginning, and he had to remain with his regiment.\nAnd since it had to be so, Nicholas Rostóv, as was natural to him, felt\ncontented with the life he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure\nin that life.\nOn his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully welcomed\nby his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the"}, {"page": 900, "text": "Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation\nfrom his commanders. During his absence he had been promoted captain,\nand when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in numbers,\nhe was again allotted his old squadron.\nThe campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double\npay, new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody\nwas infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the\ncommencement of a war, and Rostóv, conscious of his advantageous\nposition in the regiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and\ninterests of military service, though he knew that sooner or later he would\nhave to relinquish them.\nThe troops retired from Vílna for various complicated reasons of state,\npolitical and strategic. Each step of the retreat was accompanied by a\ncomplicated interplay of interests, arguments, and passions at headquarters.\nFor the Pávlograd hussars, however, the whole of this retreat during the\nfinest period of summer and with sufficient supplies was a very simple and\nagreeable business.\nIt was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness, and\nintriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where they\nwere going or why. If they regretted having to retreat, it was only because\nthey had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to, or some pretty\nyoung Polish lady. If the thought that things looked bad chanced to enter\nanyone’s head, he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to\nthink of the general trend of affairs, but only of the task nearest to hand.\nFirst they camped gaily before Vílna, making acquaintance with the Polish\nlandowners, preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the Emperor and\nother high commanders. Then came an order to retreat to Sventsyáni and\ndestroy any provisions they could not carry away with them. Sventsyáni\nwas remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp, a name the\nwhole army gave to their encampment there, and because many complaints\nwere made against the troops, who, taking advantage of the order to collect\nprovisions, took also horses, carriages, and carpets from the Polish\nproprietors. Rostóv remembered Sventsyáni, because on the first day of\ntheir arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant major and was\nunable to manage all the drunken men of his squadron who, unknown to\nhim, had appropriated five barrels of old beer.

In general, the summer of 1812 was remarkable for its\nstorms.\nThe two Pávlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye, which\nwas already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and\nhorses. The rain was descending in torrents, and Rostóv, with a young\nofficer named Ilyín, his protégé, was sitting in a hastily constructed shelter.\nAn officer of their regiment, with long mustaches extending onto his\ncheeks, who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the rain, entered\nRostóv’s shelter.\n“I have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of Raévski’s\nexploit?”\nAnd the officer gave them details of the Saltánov battle, which he had\nheard at the staff.\nRostóv, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water trickled\ndown his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional glance at Ilyín,\nwho was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad of sixteen who had\nrecently joined the regiment, was now in the same relation to Nicholas that\nNicholas had been to Denísov seven years before. Ilyín tried to imitate\nRostóv in everything and adored him as a girl might have done.\nZdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke grandiloquently of\nthe Saltánov dam being “a Russian Thermopylae,” and of how a deed\nworthy of antiquity had been performed by General Raévski. He recounted\nhow Raévski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had\ncharged with them beside him. Rostóv heard the story and not only said\nnothing to encourage Zdrzhinski’s enthusiasm but, on the contrary, looked\nlike a man ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no intention of\ncontradicting it. Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rostóv\nknew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits,\nas he himself had done when recounting them; besides that, he had\nexperience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can\nimagine or relate it.

And\neven those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it, for\nwhat had they to do with Raévski’s tender paternal feelings when their own\nskins were in danger? And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did not\ndepend on whether they took the Saltánov dam or not, as we are told was\nthe case at Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a sacrifice?\nAnd why expose his own children in the battle? I would not have taken my\nbrother Pétya there, or even Ilyín, who’s a stranger to me but a nice lad, but\nwould have tried to put them somewhere under cover,” Nicholas continued\nto think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But he did not express his thoughts,\nfor in such matters, too, he had gained experience. He knew that this tale\nredounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to pretend not to doubt\nit. And he acted accordingly.\n“I can’t stand this any more,” said Ilyín, noticing that Rostóv did not\nrelish Zdrzhinski’s conversation. “My stockings and shirt... and the water is\nrunning on my seat! I’ll go and look for shelter. The rain seems less heavy.”\nIlyín went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.\nFive minutes later Ilyín, splashing through the mud, came running back\nto the shanty.\n“Hurrah!

We can at least get\ndry there, and Mary Hendríkhovna’s there.”\nMary Hendríkhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty\nyoung German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether from\nlack of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in the\nearly days of their marriage, took her about with him wherever the hussar\nregiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among the\nhussar officers.\nRostóv threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to Lavrúshka to\nfollow with the things, and—now slipping in the mud, now splashing right"}, {"page": 903, "text": "through it—set off with Ilyín in the lessening rain and the darkness that was\noccasionally rent by distant lightning.\n“Rostóv, where are you?”\n“Here.

Mary Hendríkhovna, a plump little blonde\nGerman, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench in\nthe front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her. Rostóv and\nIlyín, on entering the room, were welcomed with merry shouts and laughter.\n“Dear me, how jolly we are!” said Rostóv laughing.\n“And why do you stand there gaping?”\n“What swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Don’t make\nour drawing room so wet.”\n“Don’t mess Mary Hendríkhovna’s dress!” cried other voices.\nRostóv and Ilyín hastened to find a corner where they could change into\ndry clothes without offending Mary Hendríkhovna’s modesty. They were\ngoing into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but found it\ncompletely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light of a\nsolitary candle on an empty box, and these officers would on no account\nyield their position. Mary Hendríkhovna obliged them with the loan of a\npetticoat to be used as a curtain, and behind that screen Rostóv and Ilyín,\nhelped by Lavrúshka who had brought their kits, changed their wet things\nfor dry ones.\nA fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was found,\nfixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar was\nproduced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary\nHendríkhovna to preside, they all crowded round her. One offered her a\nclean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands, another spread a jacket\nunder her little feet to keep them from the damp, another hung his coat over\nthe window to keep out the draft, and yet another waved the flies off her\nhusband’s face, lest he should wake up."}, {"page": 905, "text": "“Leave him alone,” said Mary Hendríkhovna, smiling timidly and\nhappily. “He is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night.”\n“Oh, no, Mary Hendríkhovna,” replied the officer, “one must look after\nthe doctor. Perhaps he’ll take pity on me someday, when it comes to cutting\noff a leg or an arm for me.”\nThere were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one could\nnot make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar held\nonly six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter to take turns in\norder of seniority to receive one’s tumbler from Mary Hendríkhovna’s\nplump little hands with their short and not overclean nails. All the officers\nappeared to be, and really were, in love with her that evening. Even those\nplaying cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to the\nsamovar, yielding to the general mood of courting Mary Hendríkhovna.\nShe, seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men,\nbeamed with satisfaction, try as she might to hide it, and perturbed as she\nevidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her.\nThere was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything else,\nbut it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary Hendríkhovna\nshould stir the sugar for everyone in turn. Rostóv received his tumbler, and\nadding some rum to it asked Mary Hendríkhovna to stir it.\n“But you take it without sugar?” she said, smiling all the time, as if\neverything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and\nhad a double meaning.\n“It is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should stir my\ntea.”\nMary Hendríkhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which\nsomeone meanwhile had pounced on.\n“Use your finger, Mary Hendríkhovna, it will be still nicer,” said Rostóv.\n“Too hot!” she replied, blushing with pleasure.\nIlyín put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to\nMary Hendríkhovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.\n“This is my cup,” said he. “Only dip your finger in it and I’ll drink it all\nup.”\nWhen they had emptied the samovar, Rostóv took a pack of cards and\nproposed that they should play “Kings” with Mary Hendríkhovna. They"}, {"page": 906, "text": "drew lots to settle who should make up her set. At Rostóv’s suggestion it\nwas agreed that whoever became “King” should have the right to kiss Mary\nHendríkhovna’s hand, and that the “Booby” should go to refill and reheat\nthe samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.\n“Well, but supposing Mary Hendríkhovna is ‘King’?” asked Ilyín.\n“As it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!”\nThey had hardly begun to play before the doctor’s disheveled head\nsuddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendríkhovna. He had been awake\nfor some time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found\nnothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad and\ndepressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and asked to\nbe allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon as he had left the\nroom all the officers burst into loud laughter and Mary Hendríkhovna\nblushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became still more\nattractive to them. Returning from the yard, the doctor told his wife (who\nhad ceased to smile so happily, and looked at him in alarm, awaiting her\nsentence) that the rain had ceased and they must go to sleep in their covered\ncart, or everything in it would be stolen.\n“But I’ll send an orderly.... Two of them!” said Rostóv. “What an idea,\ndoctor!”\n“I’ll stand guard on it myself!” said Ilyín.\n“No, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for two\nnights,” replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his wife,\nwaiting for the game to end.\nSeeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers grew still\nmerrier, and some of them could not refrain from laughter, for which they\nhurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When he had gone, taking his wife with\nhim, and had settled down with her in their covered cart, the officers lay\ndown in the tavern, covering themselves with their wet cloaks, but they did\nnot sleep for a long time; now they exchanged remarks, recalling the\ndoctor’s uneasiness and his wife’s delight, now they ran out into the porch\nand reported what was taking place in the covered trap. Several times\nRostóv, covering his head, tried to go to sleep, but some remark would\narouse him and conversation would be resumed, to the accompaniment of\nunreasoning, merry, childlike laughter."}, {"page": 907, "text": "CHAPTER XIV\nIt was nearly three o’clock but no one was yet asleep, when the\nquartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of\nOstróvna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began hurriedly getting\nready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar. But Rostóv went\noff to his squadron without waiting for tea. Day was breaking, the rain had\nceased, and the clouds were dispersing. It felt damp and cold, especially in\nclothes that were still moist. As they left the tavern in the twilight of the\ndawn, Rostóv and Ilyín both glanced under the wet and glistening leather\nhood of the doctor’s cart, from under the apron of which his feet were\nsticking out, and in the middle of which his wife’s nightcap was visible and\nher sleepy breathing audible.\n“She really is a dear little thing,” said Rostóv to Ilyín, who was following\nhim.\n“A charming woman!” said Ilyín, with all the gravity of a boy of sixteen.\nHalf an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The command\nwas heard to “mount” and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted.\nRostóv riding in front gave the order “Forward!” and the hussars, with\nclanking sabers and subdued talk, their horses’ hoofs splashing in the mud,\ndefiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch trees on\neach side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone on in front.\nTattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding before\nthe wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass which always\ngrows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still wet with the night’s\nrain; the drooping branches of the birches, also wet, swayed in the wind and\nflung down bright drops of water to one side. The soldiers’ faces were more\nand more clearly visible. Rostóv, always closely followed by Ilyín, rode\nalong the side of the road between two rows of birch trees."}, {"page": 908, "text": "When campaigning, Rostóv allowed himself the indulgence of riding not\na regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sportsman, he\nhad lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Donéts horse, dun-\ncolored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could\noutgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought of\nthe horse, of the morning, of the doctor’s wife, but not once of the\nimpending danger.\nFormerly, when going into action, Rostóv had felt afraid; now he had not\nthe least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown used to\nbeing under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because he had\nlearned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown\naccustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would\nseem most likely to interest him—the impending danger. During the first\nperiod of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself\nwith cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time it had come\nof itself. Now he rode beside Ilyín under the birch trees, occasionally\nplucking leaves from a branch that met his hand, sometimes touching his\nhorse’s side with his foot, or, without turning round, handing a pipe he had\nfinished to an hussar riding behind him, with as calm and careless an air as\nthough he were merely out for a ride. He glanced with pity at the excited\nface of Ilyín, who talked much and in great agitation. He knew from\nexperience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet was\nsuffering and knew that only time could help him.\nAs soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds, the\nwind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning after the\nstorm; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and all was still. The\nwhole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow\ncloud that hung above it. A few minutes later it reappeared brighter still\nfrom behind the top of the cloud, tearing its edge. Everything grew bright\nand glittered. And with that light, and as if in reply to it, came the sound of\nguns ahead of them.\nBefore Rostóv had had time to consider and determine the distance of\nthat firing, Count Ostermann-Tolstóy’s adjutant came galloping from\nVítebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.\nThe squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery—which\nhad also quickened their pace—rode down a hill, and passing through an"}, {"page": 909, "text": "empty and deserted village again ascended.

Walk, march!” came the order from in\nfront.\nAnd the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left flank of our\nposition, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line. To the right\nstood our infantry in a dense column: they were the reserve. Higher up the\nhill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through the wonderfully\nclear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams. In front,\nbeyond a hollow dale, could be seen the enemy’s columns and guns. Our\nadvanced line, already in action, could be heard briskly exchanging shots\nwith the enemy in the dale.\nAt these sounds, long unheard, Rostóv’s spirits rose, as at the strains of\nthe merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots, now together, now\nseveral quickly one after another. Again all was silent and then again it\nsounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them.\nThe hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A cannonade\nbegan. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron, halted,\nspoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode up the hill to the guns.\nAfter Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.\n“Form column! Prepare to charge!”\nThe infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry to\npass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears fluttering, and trotted\ndownhill toward the French cavalry which was seen below to the left.\nAs soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered up the\nhill to support the battery.

Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening out before\nhim from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the movement of the\nUhlans.

He felt\ninstinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons now, the latter\ncould not withstand them, but if a charge was to be made it must be done\nnow, at that very moment, or it would be too late. He looked around. A\ncaptain, standing beside him, was gazing like himself with eyes fixed on the\ncavalry below them.\n“Andrew Sevastyánych!” said Rostóv. “You know, we could crush\nthem....”\n“A fine thing too!” replied the captain, “and really...”\nRostóv, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to\nthe front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the word\nof command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following him.\nRostóv himself did not know how or why he did it.

The bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around\nhim and his horse was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself. He\ntouched his horse, gave the word of command, and immediately, hearing\nbehind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron, rode at full\ntrot downhill toward the dragoons.

One Uhlan stopped, another who was on\nfoot flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a\nriderless horse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons\nwere galloping back. Rostóv, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed after\nhim. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and\nalmost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would\nimmediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by his\nuniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse and\nurging it on with his saber. In another moment Rostóv’s horse dashed its\nbreast against the hindquarters of the officer’s horse, almost knocking it\nover, and at the same instant Rostóv, without knowing why, raised his saber\nand struck the Frenchman with it.\nThe instant he had done this, all Rostóv’s animation vanished. The officer\nfell, not so much from the blow—which had but slightly cut his arm above\nthe elbow—as from the shock to his horse and from fright. Rostóv reined in\nhis horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished. The\nFrench dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on the ground, the other\nbeing caught in the stirrup. His eyes, screwed up with fear as if he every\nmoment expected another blow, gazed up at Rostóv with shrinking terror.\nHis pale and mud-stained face—fair and young, with a dimple in the chin\nand light-blue eyes—was not an enemy’s face at all suited to a battlefield,\nbut a most ordinary, homelike face. Before Rostóv had decided what to do\nwith him, the officer cried, “I surrender!” He hurriedly but vainly tried to\nget his foot out of the stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes\nfrom Rostóv’s face. Some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and\nhelped him into the saddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy with the\ndragoons; one was wounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would\nnot give up his horse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his\narms round him; a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse.\nIn front, the French infantry were firing as they ran.

She was\nso ill that it was impossible for them to consider in how far she was to\nblame for what had happened. She could not eat or sleep, grew visibly\nthinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them feel, was in danger. They\ncould not think of anything but how to help her. Doctors came to see her\nsingly and in consultation, talked much in French, German, and Latin,\nblamed one another, and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the\ndiseases known to them, but the simple idea never occurred to any of them\nthat they could not know the disease Natásha was suffering from, as no\ndisease suffered by a live man can be known, for every living person has his\nown peculiarities and always has his own peculiar, personal, novel,\ncomplicated disease, unknown to medicine—not a disease of the lungs,\nliver, skin, heart, nerves, and so on mentioned in medical books, but a\ndisease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the maladies\nof those organs. This simple thought could not occur to the doctors (as it\ncannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to work his charms) because the\nbusiness of their lives was to cure, and they received money for it and had\nspent the best years of their lives on that business. But, above all, that\nthought was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were\nreally useful, as in fact they were to the whole Rostóv family.

They satisfied the need seen in its most elementary\nform in a child, when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A\nchild knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to\nhave the aching spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better when this is done.\nThe child cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no\nremedy for its pain, and the hope of relief and the expression of its mother’s\nsympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it. The doctors were of use to\nNatásha because they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her that it\nwould soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemist’s in the Arbát\nand got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble and seventy\nkopeks, and if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of\nprecisely two hours, neither more nor less.\nWhat would Sónya and the count and countess have done, how would\nthey have looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been those pills\nto give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken cutlets, and all the other\ndetails of life ordered by the doctors, the carrying out of which supplied an\noccupation and consolation to the family circle? How would the count have\nborne his dearly loved daughter’s illness had he not known that it was\ncosting him a thousand rubles, and that he would not grudge thousands\nmore to benefit her, or had he not known that if her illness continued he\nwould not grudge yet other thousands and would take her abroad for\nconsultations there, and had he not been able to explain the details of how\nMétivier and Feller had not understood the symptoms, but Frise had, and\nMúdrov had diagnosed them even better?

Even to Natásha herself it was\npleasant to see that so many sacrifices were being made for her sake, and to\nknow that she had to take medicine at certain hours, though she declared\nthat no medicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense. And it was\neven pleasant to be able to show, by disregarding the orders, that she did not\nbelieve in medical treatment and did not value her life.\nThe doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and\nregardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her.

She not merely avoided all external\nforms of pleasure—balls, promenades, concerts, and theaters—but she\nnever laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not sing.\nAs soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, tears choked her:\ntears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those pure times which could\nnever return, tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined her\nyoung life which might have been so happy. Laughter and singing in\nparticular seemed to her like a blasphemy, in face of her sorrow. Without\nany need of self-restraint, no wish to coquet ever entered her head. She said\nand felt at that time that no man was more to her than Nastásya Ivánovna,\nthe buffoon. Something stood sentinel within her and forbade her every joy.\nBesides, she had lost all the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had\nbeen so full of hope. The previous autumn, the hunting, “Uncle,” and the\nChristmas holidays spent with Nicholas at Otrádnoe were what she recalled\noftenest and most painfully. What would she not have given to bring back\neven a single day of that time! But it was gone forever.

Yet it was necessary to live on.\nIt comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly\nimagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the world. But this\nwas not enough. She knew that, and asked herself, “What next?” But there\nwas nothing to come. There was no joy in life, yet life was passing. Natásha\napparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to anyone, but wanted\nnothing for herself. She kept away from everyone in the house and felt at\nease only with her brother Pétya. She liked to be with him better than with\nthe others, and when alone with him she sometimes laughed.

But she was not even grateful to him for it; nothing\ngood on Pierre’s part seemed to her to be an effort, it seemed so natural for\nhim to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness.\nSometimes Natásha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in\nher presence, especially when he wanted to do something to please her, or\nfeared that something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to\nher. She noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness,\nwhich she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her.\nAfter those involuntary words—that if he were free he would have asked on\nhis knees for her hand and her love—uttered at a moment when she was so\nstrongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to Natásha of his feelings; and it\nseemed plain to her that those words, which had then so comforted her,\nwere spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a\ncrying child. It was not because Pierre was a married man, but because\nNatásha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of which\nshe had experienced with Kurágin that it never entered her head that the\nrelations between him and herself could lead to love on her part, still less on\nhis, or even to the kind of tender, self-conscious, romantic friendship\nbetween a man and a woman of which she had known several instances.\nBefore the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agraféna Ivánovna Belóva, a\ncountry neighbor of the Rostóvs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions at\nthe shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that Natásha should fast\nand prepare for Holy Communion, and Natásha gladly welcomed the idea.\nDespite the doctor’s orders that she should not go out early in the morning,\nNatásha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament, not as they\ngenerally prepared for it in the Rostóv family by attending three services in\ntheir own house, but as Agraféna Ivánovna did, by going to church every\nday for a week and not once missing Vespers, Matins, or Mass.\nThe countess was pleased with Natásha’s zeal; after the poor results of\nthe medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer\nmight help her daughter more than medicines and, though not without fear\nand concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to Natásha’s wish and\nentrusted her to Belóva. Agraféna Ivánovna used to come to wake Natásha\nat three in the morning, but generally found her already awake. She was\nafraid of being late for Matins.

By Agraféna\nIvánovna’s advice Natásha prepared herself not in their own parish, but at a\nchurch where, according to the devout Agraféna Ivánovna, the priest was a\nman of very severe and lofty life. There were never many people in the\nchurch; Natásha always stood beside Belóva in the customary place before\nan icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the screen before the choir on the left\nside, and a feeling, new to her, of humility before something great and\nincomprehensible, seized her when at that unusual morning hour, gazing at\nthe dark face of the Virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and\nby the morning light falling from the window, she listened to the words of\nthe service which she tried to follow with understanding. When she\nunderstood them her personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers\nwith shades of its own. When she did not understand, it was sweeter still to\nthink that the wish to understand everything is pride, that it is impossible to\nunderstand all, that it is only necessary to believe and to commit oneself to\nGod, whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments. She crossed herself,\nbowed low, and when she did not understand, in horror at her own vileness,\nsimply asked God to forgive her everything, everything, to have mercy\nupon her. The prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were\nthose of repentance. On her way home at an early hour when she met no\none but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street, and\neverybody within the houses was still asleep, Natásha experienced a feeling\nnew to her, a sense of the possibility of correcting her faults, the possibility\nof a new, clean life, and of happiness.\nDuring the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every day.\nAnd the happiness of taking communion, or “communing” as Agraféna\nIvánovna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to Natásha so\ngreat that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.\nBut the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, dressed\nin white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the first time for\nmany months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life that\nlay before her.\nThe doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the\npowders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.\n“She must certainly go on taking them morning and evening,” said he,\nevidently sincerely satisfied with his success. “Only, please be particular"}, {"page": 921, "text": "about it.\n“Be quite easy,” he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the gold coin\nin his palm. “She will soon be singing and frolicking about.

And as up\nto the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had been received,\nexaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of\nRussia. It was said that the Emperor was leaving the army because it was in\ndanger, it was said that Smolénsk had surrendered, that Napoleon had an\narmy of a million and only a miracle could save Russia.\nOn the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was received\nbut was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the Rostóvs’, promised to\ncome to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a copy of the manifesto and\nappeal, which he would obtain from Count Rostopchín.\nThat Sunday, the Rostóvs went to Mass at the Razumóvskis’ private\nchapel as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten o’clock, when the\nRostóvs got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air, the shouts of\nhawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, the dusty leaves of\nthe trees on the boulevard, the sounds of the band and the white trousers of\na battalion marching to parade, the rattling of wheels on the cobblestones,\nand the brilliant, hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor, that\ncontent and discontent with the present, which is most strongly felt on a\nbright, hot day in town. All the Moscow notabilities, all the Rostóvs’\nacquaintances, were at the Razumóvskis’ chapel, for, as if expecting\nsomething to happen, many wealthy families who usually left town for their\ncountry estates had not gone away that summer. As Natásha, at her mother’s\nside, passed through the crowd behind a liveried footman who cleared the\nway for them, she heard a young man speaking about her in too loud a\nwhisper.\n“That’s Rostóva, the one who...”"}, {"page": 923, "text": "“She’s much thinner, but all the same she’s pretty!”\nShe heard, or thought she heard, the names of Kurágin and Bolkónski.\nBut she was always imagining that.

With a\nsinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she found herself in a\ncrowd, Natásha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked—as\nwomen can walk—with the more repose and stateliness the greater the pain\nand shame in her soul. She knew for certain that she was pretty, but this no\nlonger gave her satisfaction as it used to. On the contrary it tormented her\nmore than anything else of late, and particularly so on this bright, hot\nsummer day in town. “It’s Sunday again—another week past,” she thought,\nrecalling that she had been here the Sunday before, “and always the same\nlife that is no life, and the same surroundings in which it used to be so easy\nto live. I’m pretty, I’m young, and I know that now I am good. I used to be\nbad, but now I know I am good,” she thought, “but yet my best years are\nslipping by and are no good to anyone.” She stood by her mother’s side and\nexchanged nods with acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the\nladies’ dresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was\nnot crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she\nthought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging\nothers, and suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt horrified at her\nown vileness, horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to\nher.\nA comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that\nmild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the souls\nof the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were closed, the curtain\nwas slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft mysterious voice pronounced\nsome words. Tears, the cause of which she herself did not understand, made\nNatásha’s breast heave, and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her.\n“Teach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good\nforever, forever!” she pleaded.\nThe deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and,\nholding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his dalmatic\nand, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a loud and solemn\nvoice to recite the words of the prayer....\n“In peace let us pray unto the Lord.”"}, {"page": 924, "text": "“As one community, without distinction of class, without enmity, united\nby brotherly love—let us pray!” thought Natásha.\n“For the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our souls.”\n“For the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,” prayed\nNatásha.\nWhen they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and\nDenísov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she\nremembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her\nall the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love us,\nshe prayed for the members of her own family, her father and mother and\nSónya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward them,\nand feeling all the strength of her love for them. When they prayed for those\nwho hate us, she tried to think of her enemies and people who hated her, in\norder to pray for them. She included among her enemies the creditors and\nall who had business dealings with her father, and always at the thought of\nenemies and those who hated her she remembered Anatole who had done\nher so much harm—and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for\nhim as for an enemy. Only at prayer did she feel able to think clearly and\ncalmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole, as men for whom her feelings were\nas nothing compared with her awe and devotion to God. When they prayed\nfor the Imperial family and the Synod, she bowed very low and made the\nsign of the cross, saying to herself that even if she did not understand, still\nshe could not doubt, and at any rate loved the governing Synod and prayed\nfor it.\nWhen he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over his\nbreast and said, “Let us commit ourselves and our whole lives to Christ the\nLord!”\n“Commit ourselves to God,” Natásha inwardly repeated. “Lord God, I\nsubmit myself to Thy will!” she thought. “I want nothing, wish for nothing;\nteach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take me!” prayed\nNatásha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing herself but letting\nher slender arms hang down as if expecting some invisible power at any\nmoment to take her and deliver her from herself, from her regrets, desires,\nremorse, hopes, and sins.\nThe countess looked round several times at her daughter’s softened face\nand shining eyes and prayed God to help her."}, {"page": 925, "text": "Unexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual order\nNatásha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool, the one he\nknelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it before the doors of\nthe sanctuary screen.

But\nneither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being read\non bended knees.

That terrible question “Why?” “Wherefore?” which had come to him\namid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or by a\nreply to the former question, but by her image. When he listened to, or\nhimself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of human\nbaseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did not ask himself\nwhy men struggled so about these things when all is so transient and\nincomprehensible—but he remembered her as he had last seen her, and all\nhis doubts vanished—not because she had answered the questions that had\nhaunted him, but because his conception of her transferred him instantly to\nanother, a brighter, realm of spiritual activity in which no one could be\njustified or guilty—a realm of beauty and love which it was worth living\nfor. Whatever worldly baseness presented itself to him, he said to himself:\n“Well, supposing N. N. has swindled the country and the Tsar, and the\ncountry and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter? She\nsmiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her, and no\none will ever know it.” And his soul felt calm and peaceful.\nPierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same idle and\ndissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the Rostóvs’ there\nwere other hours he had to spend somehow, and the habits and\nacquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that bore him\nalong irresistibly. But latterly, when more and more disquieting reports\ncame from the seat of war and Natásha’s health began to improve and she\nno longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity, an ever-\nincreasing restlessness, which he could not explain, took possession of him."}, {"page": 928, "text": "He felt that the condition he was in could not continue long, that a\ncatastrophe was coming which would change his whole life, and he\nimpatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe.\nOne of his brother Masons had revealed to Pierre the following prophecy\nconcerning Napoleon, drawn from the Revelation of St. John.\nIn chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:\nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the\nbeast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred\nthreescore and six.\nAnd in the fifth verse of the same chapter:\nAnd there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and\nblasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two\nmonths.\nThe French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as the\nHebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the others tens, will\nhave the following significance:\n      a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k\n      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10\n       l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s\n      20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90\n             t    u    v    w    x    y\n            100  110  120  130  140  150\n                        z\n                       160\nWriting the words L’Empereur Napoléon in numbers, it appears that the\nsum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold in\nthe Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the words\nquarante-deux, * which was the term allowed to the beast that “spoke great\nthings and blasphemies,” the same number 666 was obtained; from which it\nfollowed that the limit fixed for Napoleon’s power had come in the year\n1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy pleased Pierre\nvery much and he often asked himself what would put an end to the power\nof the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the same system of using\nletters as numbers and adding them up, to find an answer to the question\nthat engrossed him. He wrote the words L’Empereur Alexandre, La nation\nrusse and added up their numbers, but the sums were either more or less"}, {"page": 929, "text": "than 666. Once when making such calculations he wrote down his own\nname in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the sum of the numbers did\nnot come right. Then he changed the spelling, substituting a z for the s and\nadding de and the article le, still without obtaining the desired result. Then\nit occurred to him: if the answer to the question were contained in his name,\nhis nationality would also be given in the answer. So he wrote Le russe\nBesuhof and adding up the numbers got 671. This was only five too much,\nand five was represented by e, the very letter elided from the article le\nbefore the word Empereur. By omitting the e, though incorrectly, Pierre got\nthe answer he sought. L’russe Besuhof made 666. This discovery excited\nhim. How, or by what means, he was connected with the great event\nforetold in the Apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt that\nconnection for a moment. His love for Natásha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the\ninvasion, the comet, 666, L’Empereur Napoléon, and L’russe Besuhof—all\nthis had to mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty\nsphere of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him\nto a great achievement and great happiness.\n* Forty-two.\nOn the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre had\npromised the Rostóvs to bring them, from Count Rostopchín whom he\nknew well, both the appeal to the people and the news from the army. In the\nmorning, when he went to call at Rostopchín’s he met there a courier fresh\nfrom the army, an acquaintance of his own, who often danced at Moscow\nballs.\n“Do, please, for heaven’s sake, relieve me of something!” said the\ncourier. “I have a sackful of letters to parents.”\nAmong these letters was one from Nicholas Rostóv to his father. Pierre\ntook that letter, and Rostopchín also gave him the Emperor’s appeal to\nMoscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders, and his own\nmost recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders, Pierre found in one\nof them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and rewarded, the name of Nicholas\nRostóv, awarded a St. George’s Cross of the Fourth Class for courage\nshown in the Ostróvna affair, and in the same order the name of Prince\nAndrew Bolkónski, appointed to the command of a regiment of Chasseurs."}, {"page": 930, "text": "Though he did not want to remind the Rostóvs of Bolkónski, Pierre could\nnot refrain from making them happy by the news of their son’s having\nreceived a decoration, so he sent that printed army order and Nicholas’\nletter to the Rostóvs, keeping the appeal, the bulletin, and the other orders\nto take with him when he went to dinner.\nHis conversation with Count Rostopchín and the latter’s tone of anxious\nhurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly things\nwere going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of spies in Moscow and\nof a leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon promised to be in both the\nRussian capitals by the autumn, and the talk of the Emperor’s being\nexpected to arrive next day—all aroused with fresh force that feeling of\nagitation and expectation in Pierre which he had been conscious of ever\nsince the appearance of the comet, and especially since the beginning of the\nwar.\nHe had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so\nhad he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society of\nFreemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual\npeace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact that when he saw\nthe great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking\npatriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step. But the chief reason\nfor not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the vague idea that\nhe was L’russe Besuhof who had the number of the beast, 666; that his part\nin the great affair of setting a limit to the power of the beast that spoke great\nand blasphemous things had been predestined from eternity, and that\ntherefore he ought not to undertake anything, but wait for what was bound\nto come to pass."}, {"page": 931, "text": "CHAPTER XX\nA few intimate friends were dining with the Rostóvs that day, as usual on\nSundays.\nPierre came early so as to find them alone.\nHe had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had\nhe not been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he carried his bulk\nwith evident ease.\nHe went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His coachman\ndid not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his master was\nat the Rostóvs’ he stayed till midnight. The Rostóvs’ footman rushed\neagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and stick.\nPierre, from club habit, always left both hat and stick in the anteroom.\nThe first person he saw in the house was Natásha. Even before he saw\nher, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing solfa\nexercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since her\nillness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him. He\nopened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had worn at\nchurch, walking about the room singing. She had her back to him when he\nopened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his broad, surprised\nface, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.\n“I want to try to sing again,” she said, adding as if by way of excuse, “it\nis, at least, something to do.”\n“That’s capital!”\n“How glad I am you’ve come! I am so happy today,” she said, with the\nold animation Pierre had not seen in her for a long time. “You know\nNicholas has received a St. George’s Cross? I am so proud of him.”\n“Oh yes, I sent that announcement. But I don’t want to interrupt you,” he\nadded, and was about to go to the drawing room."}, {"page": 932, "text": "Natásha stopped him.\n“Count, is it wrong of me to sing?” she said blushing, and fixing her eyes\ninquiringly on him.\n“No... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?”\n“I don’t know myself,” Natásha answered quickly, “but I should not like\nto do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely. You don’t\nknow how important you are to me, how much you’ve done for me....” She\nspoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her words. “I saw in\nthat same army order that he, Bolkónski” (she whispered the name hastily),\n“is in Russia, and in the army again. What do you think?”—she was\nspeaking hurriedly, evidently afraid her strength might fail her—“Will he\never forgive me? Will he not always have a bitter feeling toward me? What\ndo you think? What do you think?”\n“I think...” Pierre replied, “that he has nothing to forgive.... If I were in\nhis place...”\nBy association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the day when,\ntrying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself but the best\nman in the world and free, he would ask on his knees for her hand; and the\nsame feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took possession of him and the\nsame words rose to his lips. But she did not give him time to say them.\n“Yes, you... you...” she said, uttering the word you rapturously—“that’s a\ndifferent thing. I know no one kinder, more generous, or better than you;\nnobody could be! Had you not been there then, and now too, I don’t know\nwhat would have become of me, because...”\nTears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music before\nher eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and down the\nroom.\nJust then Pétya came running in from the drawing room.\nPétya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and\nresembled Natásha. He was preparing to enter the university, but he and his\nfriend Obolénski had lately, in secret, agreed to join the hussars.\nPétya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair. He\nhad asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the hussars.\nPierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what Pétya\nwas saying."}, {"page": 933, "text": "Pétya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.\n“Well, what about my plan? Peter Kirílych, for heaven’s sake! You are\nmy only hope,” said Pétya.\n“Oh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I’ll mention it, I’ll bring it all up\ntoday.”\n“Well, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?” asked the old count. “The\ncountess has been to Mass at the Razumóvskis’ and heard the new prayer.\nShe says it’s very fine.”\n“Yes, I’ve got it,” said Pierre. “The Emperor is to be here tomorrow...\nthere’s to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they are talking\nof a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate you!”\n“Yes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?”\n“We are again retreating. They say we’re already near Smolénsk,” replied\nPierre.\n“O Lord, O Lord!” exclaimed the count. “Where is the manifesto?”\n“The Emperor’s appeal? Oh yes!”\nPierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not find\nthem. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess who\nentered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently expecting Natásha,\nwho had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing room.\n“On my word, I don’t know what I’ve done with it,” he said.\n“There he is, always losing everything!” remarked the countess.\nNatásha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and sat\ndown looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, Pierre’s features,\nwhich had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and while still searching for\nthe papers he glanced at her several times.\n“No, really! I’ll drive home, I must have left them there. I’ll certainly...”\n“But you’ll be late for dinner.”\n“Oh! And my coachman has gone.”\nBut Sónya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom, had\nfound them in Pierre’s hat, where he had carefully tucked them under the\nlining. Pierre was about to begin reading."}, {"page": 934, "text": "“No, after dinner,” said the old count, evidently expecting much\nenjoyment from that reading.\nAt dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new\nchevalier of St. George, Shinshín told them the town news, of the illness of\nthe old Georgian princess, of Métivier’s disappearance from Moscow, and\nof how some German fellow had been brought to Rostopchín and accused\nof being a French “spyer” (so Count Rostopchín had told the story), and\nhow Rostopchín let him go and assured the people that he was “not a spire\nat all, but only an old German ruin.”\n“People are being arrested...” said the count. “I’ve told the countess she\nshould not speak French so much. It’s not the time for it now.”\n“And have you heard?” Shinshín asked. “Prince Golítsyn has engaged a\nmaster to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak French in\nthe streets.”\n“And how about you, Count Peter Kirílych? If they call up the militia,\nyou too will have to mount a horse,” remarked the old count, addressing\nPierre.\nPierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming not to\ngrasp what was said. He looked at the count.\n“Oh yes, the war,” he said. “No! What sort of warrior should I make?\nAnd yet everything is so strange, so strange! I can’t make it out. I don’t\nknow, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no one\ncan answer for himself.”\nAfter dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and\nwith a serious face asked Sónya, who was considered an excellent reader, to\nread the appeal.\n“To Moscow, our ancient Capital!\n“The enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He\ncomes to despoil our beloved country.”\nSónya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice.

The countess\nshook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in\nthe manifesto. In all these words she saw only that the danger threatening\nher son would not soon be over.

May the ruin he hopes to\nbring upon us recoil on his own head, and may Europe delivered from\nbondage glorify the name of Russia!”\n“Yes, that’s it!” cried the count, opening his moist eyes and sniffing\nrepeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he\nadded, “Let the Emperor but say the word and we’ll sacrifice everything\nand begrudge nothing.”\nBefore Shinshín had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the\ncount’s patriotism, Natásha jumped up from her place and ran to her father.\n“What a darling our Papa is!” she cried, kissing him, and she again\nlooked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her with\nher better spirits.\n“There!

When he came in to tea, silent,\nmorose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to notice\nanything.\nNext day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the Rostóvs’\ndomestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him. That morning\nPétya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar to look like\na grown-up man. He frowned before his looking glass, gesticulated,\nshrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word to anyone, took\nhis cap and left the house by the back door, trying to avoid notice. Pétya\ndecided to go straight to where the Emperor was and to explain frankly to\nsome gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor to be always\nsurrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Rostóv, in spite of his\nyouth wished to serve his country; that youth could be no hindrance to\nloyalty, and that he was ready to... While dressing, Pétya had prepared\nmany fine things he meant to say to the gentleman-in-waiting.\nIt was on the very fact of being so young that Pétya counted for success\nin reaching the Emperor—he even thought how surprised everyone would\nbe at his youthfulness—and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair\nand by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man. But\nthe farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the ever-\nincreasing crowds moving toward the Krémlin, the less he remembered to\nwalk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man. As he approached the\nKrémlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his\nelbows in a menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he was so\npressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic\nintentions with which he had come that in spite of all his determination he\nhad to give in, and stop while carriages passed in, rumbling beneath the\narchway. Beside Pétya stood a peasant woman, a footman, two tradesmen,"}, {"page": 939, "text": "and a discharged soldier. After standing some time in the gateway, Pétya\ntried to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the\ncarriages to pass, and he began resolutely working his way with his elbows,\nbut the woman just in front of him, who was the first against whom he\ndirected his efforts, angrily shouted at him:\n“What are you shoving for, young lordling? Don’t you see we’re all\nstanding still? Then why push?”\n“Anybody can shove,” said the footman, and also began working his\nelbows to such effect that he pushed Pétya into a very filthy corner of the\ngateway.\nPétya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp\ncollar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a man’s.\nHe felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if he were\nnow to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be\nadmitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten oneself up or\nmove to another place, because of the crowd. One of the generals who\ndrove past was an acquaintance of the Rostóvs’, and Pétya thought of\nasking his help, but came to the conclusion that that would not be a manly\nthing to do. When the carriages had all passed in, the crowd, carrying Pétya\nwith it, streamed forward into the Krémlin Square which was already full of\npeople. There were people not only in the square, but everywhere—on the\nslopes and on the roofs. As soon as Pétya found himself in the square he\nclearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that\nfilled the whole Krémlin.\nFor a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were bared,\nand everyone rushed forward in one direction. Pétya was being pressed so\nthat he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, “Hurrah! hurrah!\nhurrah!” Pétya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see\nnothing except the people about him.\nAll the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm. A\ntradesman’s wife standing beside Pétya sobbed, and the tears ran down her\ncheeks.\n“Father! Angel! Dear one!” she kept repeating, wiping away her tears\nwith her fingers.\n“Hurrah!” was heard on all sides."}, {"page": 940, "text": "For a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush\nforward.\nQuite beside himself, Pétya, clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes\nferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting “hurrah!” as if\nhe were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else, but on both\nsides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward and\neverybody shouted “hurrah!”\n“So this is what the Emperor is!” thought Pétya. “No, I can’t petition him\nmyself—that would be too bold.” But in spite of this he continued to\nstruggle desperately forward, and from between the backs of those in front\nhe caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on\nit; but just then the crowd swayed back—the police in front were pushing\nback those who had pressed too close to the procession: the Emperor was\npassing from the palace to the Cathedral of the Assumption—and Pétya\nunexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so\nhard that suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost\nconsciousness. When he came to himself, a man of clerical appearance with\na tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock\n—probably a church clerk and chanter—was holding him under the arm\nwith one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other.\n“You’ve crushed the young gentleman!” said the clerk. “What are you up\nto? Gently!... They’ve crushed him, crushed him!”\nThe Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd spread\nout again more evenly, and the clerk led Pétya—pale and breathless—to the\nTsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for Pétya, and suddenly a crowd\nturned toward him and pressed round him. Those who stood nearest him\nattended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him on the raised platform of\nthe cannon, and reproached those others (whoever they might be) who had\ncrushed him.\n“One might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it? Killing\npeople! Poor dear, he’s as white as a sheet!”—various voices were heard\nsaying.\nPétya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain had\npassed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained a\nplace by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who would be"}, {"page": 941, "text": "returning that way.

A tradesman’s wife was showing a rent\nin her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost; another was saying\nthat all silk goods had now got dear. The clerk who had rescued Pétya was\ntalking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with\nthe bishop. The clerk several times used the word “plenary” (of the service),\na word Pétya did not understand. Two young citizens were joking with\nsome serf girls who were cracking nuts. All these conversations, especially\nthe joking with the girls, were such as might have had a particular charm for\nPétya at his age, but they did not interest him now. He sat on his elevation\n—the pedestal of the cannon—still agitated as before by the thought of the\nEmperor and by his love for him. The feeling of pain and fear he had\nexperienced when he was being crushed, together with that of rapture, still\nfurther intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion.\nSuddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the\nembankment, to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and the\ncrowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing.\nPétya too would have run there, but the clerk who had taken the young\ngentleman under his protection stopped him. The firing was still proceeding\nwhen officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the\ncathedral, and after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps were again\nraised, and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back again. At last\nfour men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral doors.\n“Hurrah! hurrah!” shouted the crowd again.\n“Which is he? Which?” asked Pétya in a tearful voice, of those around\nhim, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and Pétya,\nfixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the tears\nof joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm on him—though\nit happened not to be the Emperor—frantically shouted “Hurrah!” and\nresolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join the army."}, {"page": 942, "text": "The crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and began\nto disperse. It was already late, and Pétya had not eaten anything and was\ndrenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home but stood with that\ndiminishing, but still considerable, crowd before the palace while the\nEmperor dined—looking in at the palace windows, expecting he knew not\nwhat, and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance to dine\nwith the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table, glimpses of\nwhom could be seen through the windows.\nWhile the Emperor was dining, Valúev, looking out of the window, said:\n“The people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.”\nThe dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit, rose\nand went out onto the balcony. The people, with Pétya among them, rushed\ntoward the balcony.\n“Angel! Dear one! Hurrah!

A coachman in a\njerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched it up. Several\npeople in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this the Emperor had a\nplateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from the\nbalcony. Pétya’s eyes grew bloodshot, and still more excited by the danger\nof being crushed, he rushed at the biscuits. He did not know why, but he\nhad to have a biscuit from the Tsar’s hand and he felt that he must not give\nway. He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a\nbiscuit; the old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was\nlying on the ground—she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not\nreach them. Pétya pushed her hand away with his knee, seized a biscuit, and\nas if fearing to be too late, again shouted “Hurrah!” with a voice already\nhoarse.\nThe Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd began\nto disperse.\n“There! I said if only we waited—and so it was!” was being joyfully said\nby various people."}, {"page": 943, "text": "Happy as Pétya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all\nthe enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home from the\nKrémlin, but called on his friend Obolénski, who was fifteen and was also\nentering the regiment. On returning home Pétya announced resolutely and\nfirmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run away.\nAnd next day, Count Ilyá Rostóv—though he had not yet quite yielded—\nwent to inquire how he could arrange for Pétya to serve where there would\nbe least danger."}, {"page": 944, "text": "CHAPTER XXII\nTwo days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number of carriages\nwere standing outside the Slobóda Palace.\nThe great halls were full. In the first were the nobility and gentry in their\nuniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats of blue cloth\nand wearing medals. In the noblemen’s hall there was an incessant\nmovement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat on high-backed\nchairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor, but most of the\ngentry were strolling about the room.\nAll these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in their own\nhouses, were in uniform—some in that of Catherine’s day, others in that of\nEmperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of Alexander’s time or the\nordinary uniform of the nobility, and the general characteristic of being in\nuniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these diverse and\nfamiliar personalities, both old and young. The old men, dim-eyed,\ntoothless, bald, sallow, and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled, were especially\nstriking. For the most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent, or,\nif they walked about and talked, attached themselves to someone younger.\nOn all these faces, as on the faces of the crowd Pétya had seen in the\nSquare, there was a striking contradiction: the general expectation of a\nsolemn event, and at the same time the everyday interests in a boston card\nparty, Peter the cook, Zinaída Dmítrievna’s health, and so on.\nPierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman’s\nuniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated; this\nextraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchant-class—\nles états généraux (States-General)—evoked in him a whole series of ideas\nhe had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his soul: thoughts of\nthe Contrat Social and the French Revolution. The words that had struck\nhim in the Emperor’s appeal—that the sovereign was coming to the capital\nfor consultation with his people—strengthened this idea. And imagining"}, {"page": 945, "text": "that in this direction something important which he had long awaited was\ndrawing near, he strolled about watching and listening to conversations, but\nnowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him.\nThe Emperor’s manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all\nmoved about discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics of conversation,\nPierre heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand\nwhen the Emperor entered, when a ball should be given in the Emperor’s\nhonor, whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole\nprovinces... and so on; but as soon as the war was touched on, or what the\nnobility had been convened for, the talk became undecided and indefinite.\nThen all preferred listening to speaking.\nA middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a retired\nnaval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small crowd was\npressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the\nspeaker and listened. Count Ilyá Rostóv, in a military uniform of\nCatherine’s time, was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd,\nwith all of whom he was acquainted. He too approached that group and\nlistened with a kindly smile and nods of approval, as he always did, to what\nthe speaker was saying. The retired naval man was speaking very boldly, as\nwas evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners and from the\nfact that some people Pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men\nwalked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him. Pierre\npushed his way into the middle of the group, listened, and convinced\nhimself that the man was indeed a liberal, but of views quite different from\nhis own. The naval officer spoke in a particularly sonorous, musical, and\naristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly swallowing his r’s and generally\nslurring his consonants: the voice of a man calling out to his servant,\n“Heah! Bwing me my pipe!” It was indicative of dissipation and the\nexercise of authority.\n“What if the Smolénsk people have offahd to waise militia for the\nEmpewah? Ah we to take Smolénsk as our patte’n? If the noble\nawistocwacy of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its loyalty\nto our sov’weign the Empewah in other ways. Have we fo’gotten the\nwaising of the militia in the yeah ‘seven? All that did was to enwich the\npwiests’ sons and thieves and wobbahs....”\nCount Ilyá Rostóv smiled blandly and nodded approval."}, {"page": 946, "text": "“And was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only wuined\nour farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... o’ ou’ men will wetu’n\nneithah soldiers no’ peasants, and we’ll get only depwavity fwom them. The\nnobility don’t gwudge theah lives—evewy one of us will go and bwing in\nmore wecwuits, and the sov’weign” (that was the way he referred to the\nEmperor) “need only say the word and we’ll all die fo’ him!” added the\norator with animation.\nCount Rostóv’s mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but\nPierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred, but not\nyet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had he opened his\nmouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in his head, with a\nshrewd though angry expression, standing near the first speaker, interrupted\nhim. Evidently accustomed to managing debates and to maintaining an\nargument, he began in low but distinct tones:\n“I imagine, sir,” said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, “that we\nhave been summoned here not to discuss whether it’s best for the empire at\nthe present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia. We have\nbeen summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign the\nEmperor has honored us. But to judge what is best—conscription or the\nmilitia—we can leave to the supreme authority....”\nPierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his heart\nagainst the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude into the\ndeliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped forward and interrupted him. He\nhimself did not yet know what he would say, but he began to speak eagerly,\noccasionally lapsing into French or expressing himself in bookish Russian.\n“Excuse me, your excellency,” he began. (He was well acquainted with\nthe senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him\nformally.) “Though I don’t agree with the gentleman...” (he hesitated: he\nwished to say, “Mon très honorable préopinant”—“My very honorable\nopponent”) “with the gentleman... whom I have not the honor of knowing, I\nsuppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express their\nsympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we can\nassist our Fatherland! I imagine,” he went on, warming to his subject, “that\nthe Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely owners of\nserfs whom we are willing to devote to his service, and chair à canon * we"}, {"page": 947, "text": "are ready to make of ourselves—and not to obtain from us any co-co-\ncounsel.”\n* “Food for cannon.”\nMany persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator’s sarcastic\nsmile and the freedom of Pierre’s remarks. Only Count Rostóv was pleased\nwith them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer, the\nsenator, and in general with whatever speech he had last heard.\n“I think that before discussing these questions,” Pierre continued, “we\nshould ask the Emperor—most respectfully ask His Majesty—to let us\nknow the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our\nforces now are, and then...”\nBut scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from\nthree sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance, a\nboston player who had always been well disposed toward him, Stepán\nStepánovich Adráksin. Adráksin was in uniform, and whether as a result of\nthe uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a\ndifferent man. With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face,\nAdráksin shouted at Pierre:\n“In the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor\nabout that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that right, the Emperor\ncould not answer such a question. The troops are moved according to the\nenemy’s movements and the number of men increases and decreases....”\nAnother voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty\nyears of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies’ and knew as a\nbad cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to\nPierre, interrupted Adráksin.\n“Yes, and this is not a time for discussing,” he continued, “but for acting:\nthere is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy Russia, to\ndesecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our wives and children.” The\nnobleman smote his breast. “We will all arise, everyone of us will go, for\nour father the Tsar!” he shouted, rolling his bloodshot eyes. Several\napproving voices were heard in the crowd. “We are Russians and will not\ngrudge our blood in defense of our faith, the throne, and the Fatherland! We\nmust cease raving if we are sons of our Fatherland! We will show Europe\nhow Russia rises to the defense of Russia!”"}, {"page": 948, "text": "Pierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that his words,\napart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible than the sound\nof his opponent’s voice.\nCount Rostóv at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; several\npersons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a phrase, said:\n“That’s right, quite right! Just so!”\nPierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his serfs, or\nhimself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in order to be able to\nimprove it, but he was unable to speak. Many voices shouted and talked at\nthe same time, so that Count Rostóv had not time to signify his approval of\nthem all, and the group increased, dispersed, re-formed, and then moved\nwith a hum of talk into the largest hall and to the big table. Not only was\nPierre’s attempt to speak unsuccessful, but he was rudely interrupted,\npushed aside, and people turned away from him as from a common enemy.\nThis happened not because they were displeased by the substance of his\nspeech, which had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches,\nbut to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible\nobject to hate. Pierre became the latter. Many other orators spoke after the\nexcited nobleman, and all in the same tone. Many spoke eloquently and\nwith originality.\nGlínka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized (cries\nof “author! author!” were heard in the crowd), said that “hell must be\nrepulsed by hell,” and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning flashes\nand thunderclaps, but “we will not be that child.”\n“Yes, yes, at thunderclaps!” was repeated approvingly in the back rows of\nthe crowd.\nThe crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald\nseventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed, almost all of whom\nPierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing boston at\nthe clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced to the table.\nPressed by the throng against the high backs of the chairs, the orators spoke\none after another and sometimes two together. Those standing behind\nnoticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it. Others in\nthat heat and crush racked their brains to find some thought and hastened to\nutter it. The old magnates, whom Pierre knew, sat and turned to look first at\none and then at another, and their faces for the most part only expressed the"}, {"page": 949, "text": "fact that they found it very hot. Pierre, however, felt excited, and the general\ndesire to show that they were ready to go to all lengths—which found\nexpression in the tones and looks more than in the substance of the speeches\n—infected him too. He did not renounce his opinions, but felt himself in\nsome way to blame and wished to justify himself.\n“I only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices when\nwe know what is needed!” said he, trying to be heard above the other\nvoices.\nOne of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention was\nimmediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table.\n“Yes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!” shouted\none man.\n“He is the enemy of mankind!” cried another. “Allow me to speak....”\n“Gentlemen, you are crushing me!...”"}, {"page": 950, "text": "CHAPTER XXIII\nAt that moment Count Rostopchín with his protruding chin and alert\neyes, wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder, entered\nthe room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry.\n“Our sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment,” said Rostopchín.\n“I am straight from the palace. Seeing the position we are in, I think there is\nlittle need for discussion. The Emperor has deigned to summon us and the\nmerchants. Millions will pour forth from there”—he pointed to the\nmerchants’ hall—“but our business is to supply men and not spare\nourselves.... That is the least we can do!”\nA conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table. The\nwhole consultation passed more than quietly. After all the preceding noise\nthe sound of their old voices saying one after another, “I agree,” or for\nvariety, “I too am of that opinion,” and so on had even a mournful effect.\nThe secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow\nnobility and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully equipped, out of\nevery thousand serfs, as the Smolénsk gentry had done. Their chairs made a\nscraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose with apparent\nrelief, and began walking up and down, arm in arm, to stretch their legs and\nconverse in couples.\n“The Emperor! The Emperor!” a sudden cry resounded through the halls\nand the whole throng hurried to the entrance.\nThe Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of\nnobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck curiosity. Pierre stood\nrather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said. From what he did\nhear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger threatening the\nempire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow nobility. He was\nanswered by a voice which informed him of the resolution just arrived at.\n“Gentlemen!” said the Emperor with a quivering voice."}, {"page": 951, "text": "There was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so that\nPierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying\nwith emotion:\n“I never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it has\nsurpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the Fatherland!\nGentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious....”\nThe Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and\nrapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.\n“Yes, most precious... a royal word,” said Count Rostóv, with a sob. He\nstood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything, understood\neverything in his own way.\nFrom the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants.\nThere he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those who saw him\ncome out from the merchants’ hall with tears of emotion in his eyes. As\nbecame known later, he had scarcely begun to address the merchants before\ntears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice. When\nPierre saw the Emperor he was coming out accompanied by two merchants,\none of whom Pierre knew, a fat otkupshchík. The other was the mayor, a\nman with a thin sallow face and narrow beard. Both were weeping. Tears\nfilled the thin man’s eyes, and the fat otkupshchík sobbed outright like a\nchild and kept repeating:\n“Our lives and property—take them, Your Majesty!”\nPierre’s one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was ready\nto go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything. He now felt\nashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought an\nopportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count Mamónov was\nfurnishing a regiment, Bezúkhov at once informed Rostopchín that he\nwould give a thousand men and their maintenance.\nOld Rostóv could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears, and\nat once consented to Pétya’s request and went himself to enter his name.\nNext day the Emperor left Moscow.

Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best way,\nbecause he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great commander.\nRostóv charged the French because he could not restrain his wish for a\ngallop across a level field; and in the same way the innumerable people who\ntook part in the war acted in accord with their personal characteristics,\nhabits, circumstances, and aims. They were moved by fear or vanity,\nrejoiced or were indignant, reasoned, imagining that they knew what they\nwere doing and did it of their own free will, but they all were involuntary\ntools of history, carrying on a work concealed from them but\ncomprehensible to us. Such is the inevitable fate of men of action, and the\nhigher they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free.\nThe actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal interests\nhave vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that time but its\nhistoric results.\nProvidence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal aims, to\nfurther the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all\nexpected—neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still less any of those who\ndid the actual fighting.\nThe cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us\nnow. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance into\nthe heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for a winter\ncampaign and, on the other, the character given to the war by the burning of\nRussian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the Russian"}, {"page": 955, "text": "people. But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems so evident) that\nthis was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men—the best in\nthe world and led by the best general—could be destroyed in conflict with a\nraw army of half its numerical strength, and led by inexperienced\ncommanders as the Russian army was. Not only did no one see this, but on\nthe Russian side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could\nsave Russia, while on the French side, despite Napoleon’s experience and\nso-called military genius, every effort was directed to pushing on to\nMoscow at the end of the summer, that is, to doing the very thing that was\nbound to lead to destruction.\nIn historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of\nsaying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he sought a\nbattle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smolénsk, and of making\nsimilar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then\nunderstood. Russian authors are still fonder of telling us that from the\ncommencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was adopted to lure\nNapoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some of them attribute to\nPfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others to Toll, and others again to\nAlexander himself—pointing to notes, projects, and letters which contain\nhints of such a line of action. But all these hints at what happened, both\nfrom the French side and the Russian, are advanced only because they fit in\nwith the event. Had that event not occurred these hints would have been\nforgotten, as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and\nexpectations to the contrary which were current then but have now been\nforgotten because the event falsified them. There are always so many\nconjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will\nalways be people to say: “I said then that it would be so,” quite forgetting\nthat amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary\neffect.\nConjectures as to Napoleon’s awareness of the danger of extending his\nline, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths of\nRussia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can historians\nattribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals, or such plans to\nthe Russian commanders. All the facts are in flat contradiction to such\nconjectures. During the whole period of the war not only was there no wish\non the Russian side to draw the French into the heart of the country, but\nfrom their first entry into Russia everything was done to stop them.

Our\nEmperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian\nsoil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuel’s\nplan, and there was no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor reproached\nthe commanders in chief for every step they retired. He could not bear the\nidea of letting the enemy even reach Smolénsk, still less could he\ncontemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did unite he was\ndispleased that Smolénsk was abandoned and burned without a general\nengagement having been fought under its walls.\nSo thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were\nstill more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the\ndepths of the country.\nNapoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and\nmissed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he was at\nSmolénsk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now\nsee that advance was evidently ruinous to him.\nThe facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the\nadvance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then\nthink of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of Napoleon\ninto the depths of the country was not the result of any plan, for no one\nbelieved it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex interplay of\nintrigues, aims, and wishes among those who took part in the war and had\nno perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one way of saving\nRussia. Everything came about fortuitously. The armies were divided at the\ncommencement of the campaign. We tried to unite them, with the evident\nintention of giving battle and checking the enemy’s advance, and by this\neffort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy, and\nnecessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute angle—we led the French on\nto Smolénsk.

But as Barclay did not inspire\nconfidence his power was limited. The armies were divided, there was no\nunity of command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion,\ndivision, and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief, there\nresulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we\ncould not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone\nelse, instead of Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-\nincreasing indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic\nzeal.\nAt last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed\nthe only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for\nhim to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a\npatriotic war.

We in Moscow are\nelated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor.\n“My poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but\nthe news which I have inspires me yet more.\n“You heard probably of the heroic exploit of Raévski, embracing his two\nsons and saying: ‘I will perish with them but we will not be shaken!’ And\ntruly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we were unshakable.\nWe pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The princesses Aline and\nSophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy widows of live men, make\nbeautiful conversations over our charpie, only you, my friend, are\nmissing...” and so on.\nThe chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance of\nthis war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not recognize it, and\nlaughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner. The prince’s tone was\nso calm and confident that Princess Mary unhesitatingly believed him.\nAll that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated.\nHe planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic serfs.\nThe only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that he\nslept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual, changed his\nsleeping place every day. One day he would order his camp bed to be set up\nin the glass gallery, another day he remained on the couch or on the lounge\nchair in the drawing room and dozed there without undressing, while—\ninstead of Mademoiselle Bourienne—a serf boy read to him. Then again he\nwould spend a night in the dining room.\nOn August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his\nfirst letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had\ndutifully asked his father’s forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to\nsay and begged to be restored to his favor. To this letter the old prince had\nreplied affectionately, and from that time had kept the Frenchwoman at a"}, {"page": 962, "text": "distance. Prince Andrew’s second letter, written near Vítebsk after the\nFrench had occupied that town, gave a brief account of the whole\ncampaign, enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the\nfurther progress of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew pointed out to his\nfather the danger of staying at Bald Hills, so near the theater of war and on\nthe army’s direct line of march, and advised him to move to Moscow.\nAt dinner that day, on Dessalles’ mentioning that the French were said to\nhave already entered Vítebsk, the old prince remembered his son’s letter.\n“There was a letter from Prince Andrew today,” he said to Princess Mary\n—“Haven’t you read it?”\n“No, Father,” she replied in a frightened voice.\nShe could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had\narrived.\n“He writes about this war,” said the prince, with the ironic smile that had\nbecome habitual to him in speaking of the present war.\n“That must be very interesting,” said Dessalles. “Prince Andrew is in a\nposition to know...”\n“Oh, very interesting!” said Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n“Go and get it for me,” said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n“You know—under the paperweight on the little table.”\nMademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.\n“No, don’t!” he exclaimed with a frown. “You go, Michael Ivánovich.”\nMichael Ivánovich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he had left\nthe room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down his napkin and\nwent himself.\n“They can’t do anything... always make some muddle,” he muttered.\nWhile he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nand even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince returned\nwith quick steps, accompanied by Michael Ivánovich, bringing the letter\nand a plan. These he put down beside him—not letting anyone read them at\ndinner.\nOn moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary\nand, spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his\neyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she had done so"}, {"page": 963, "text": "Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was examining the plan,\nevidently engrossed in his own ideas.\n“What do you think of it, Prince?” Dessalles ventured to ask.\n“I? I?...” said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not taking his\neyes from the plan of the building.\n“Very possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that...”\n“Ha ha ha! The theater of war!” said the prince. “I have said and still say\nthat the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get beyond the\nNiemen.”\nDessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of the\nNiemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess Mary,\nforgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that what her\nfather was saying was correct.\n“When the snow melts they’ll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they could\nfail to see it,” the prince continued, evidently thinking of the campaign of\n1807 which seemed to him so recent. “Bennigsen should have advanced\ninto Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different turn...”\n“But, Prince,” Dessalles began timidly, “the letter mentions Vítebsk....”\n“Ah, the letter? Yes...” replied the prince peevishly. “Yes... yes...” His\nface suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused. “Yes, he writes that\nthe French were beaten at... at... what river is it?”\nDessalles dropped his eyes.\n“The prince says nothing about that,” he remarked gently.\n“Doesn’t he? But I didn’t invent it myself.”\nNo one spoke for a long time.\n“Yes... yes... Well, Michael Ivánovich,” he suddenly went on, raising his\nhead and pointing to the plan of the building, “tell me how you mean to\nalter it....”\nMichael Ivánovich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking to\nhim about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and\nwent to his own room.\nPrincess Mary saw Dessalles’ embarrassed and astonished look fixed on\nher father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her father had\nforgotten his son’s letter on the drawing room table; but she was not only"}, {"page": 964, "text": "afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his confusion and\nsilence, but was afraid even to think about it.\nIn the evening Michael Ivánovich, sent by the prince, came to Princess\nMary for Prince Andrew’s letter which had been forgotten in the drawing\nroom. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to her to do so, ventured\nto ask him what her father was doing.\n“Always busy,” replied Michael Ivánovich with a respectfully ironic\nsmile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. “He’s worrying very much\nabout the new building. He has been reading a little, but now”—Michael\nIvánovich went on, lowering his voice—“now he’s at his desk, busy with\nhis will, I expect.” (One of the prince’s favorite occupations of late had\nbeen the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and\nwhich he called his “will.”)\n“And Alpátych is being sent to Smolénsk?” asked Princess Mary.\n“Oh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.”"}, {"page": 965, "text": "CHAPTER III\nWhen Michael Ivánovich returned to the study with the letter, the old\nprince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was sitting at his open\nbureau with screened candles, holding a paper in his outstretched hand, and\nin a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript—his\n“Remarks” as he termed it—which was to be transmitted to the Emperor\nafter his death.\nWhen Michael Ivánovich went in there were tears in the prince’s eyes\nevoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had\nbeen written. He took the letter from Michael Ivánovich’s hand, put it in his\npocket, folded up his papers, and called in Alpátych who had long been\nwaiting.\nThe prince had a list of things to be bought in Smolénsk and, walking up\nand down the room past Alpátych who stood by the door, he gave his\ninstructions.\n“First, notepaper—do you hear? Eight quires, like this sample, gilt-\nedged... it must be exactly like the sample. Varnish, sealing wax, as in\nMichael Ivánovich’s list.”\nHe paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.\n“Then hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed.”\nNext, bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be\nof a special shape the prince had himself designed, and a leather case had to\nbe ordered to keep the “will” in.\nThe instructions to Alpátych took over two hours and still the prince did\nnot let him go. He sat down, sank into thought, closed his eyes, and dozed\noff. Alpátych made a slight movement.\n“Well, go, go! If anything more is wanted I’ll send after you.”"}, {"page": 966, "text": "Alpátych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into it,\nfingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at the table to\nwrite to the governor.\nIt was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished to\nsleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing\nthoughts came to him in bed. So he called Tíkhon and went through the\nrooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.\nHe went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed\nunsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study. That\ncouch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive thoughts he\nhad had when lying there. It was unsatisfactory everywhere, but the corner\nbehind the piano in the sitting room was better than other places: he had\nnever slept there yet.\nWith the help of a footman Tíkhon brought in the bedstead and began\nputting it up.\n“That’s not right! That’s not right!” cried the prince, and himself pushed\nit a few inches from the corner and then closer in again.\n“Well, at last I’ve finished, now I’ll rest,” thought the prince, and let\nTíkhon undress him.\nFrowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his\ncoat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on the bed, and\nappeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered\nyellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring the moment of\nmaking the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the bed. “Ugh, how\nhard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you would release me!” thought\nhe. Pressing his lips together he made that effort for the twenty-thousandth\ntime and lay down. But hardly had he done so before he felt the bed rocking\nbackwards and forwards beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and\njolting. This happened to him almost every night. He opened his eyes as\nthey were closing.\n“No peace, damn them!” he muttered, angry he knew not with whom.\n“Ah yes, there was something else important, very important, that I was\nkeeping till I should be in bed. The bolts? No, I told him about them. No, it\nwas something, something in the drawing room. Princess Mary talked some\nnonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something. Something in my pocket—\ncan’t remember....”"}, {"page": 967, "text": "“Tíkhon, what did we talk about at dinner?”\n“About Prince Michael...”\n“Be quiet, quiet!” The prince slapped his hand on the table. “Yes, I know,\nPrince Andrew’s letter!

Now I’ll read it.”\nHe had the letter taken from his pocket and the table—on which stood a\nglass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle—moved close to the bed, and\nputting on his spectacles he began reading. Only now in the stillness of the\nnight, reading it by the faint light under the green shade, did he grasp its\nmeaning for a moment.\n“The French at Vítebsk, in four days’ march they may be at Smolénsk;\nperhaps are already there! Tíkhon!” Tíkhon jumped up. “No, no, I don’t\nwant anything!” he shouted.\nHe put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And there rose\nbefore him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian camp, and\nhimself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face, vigorous and\nalert, entering Potëmkin’s gaily colored tent, and a burning sense of\njealousy of “the favorite” agitated him now as strongly as it had done then.\nHe recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with Potëmkin. And\nhe saw before him a plump, rather sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the\nEmpress Mother, with her smile and her words at her first gracious\nreception of him, and then that same face on the catafalque, and the\nencounter he had with Zúbov over her coffin about his right to kiss her\nhand.\n“Oh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with all the\npresent! Quicker, quicker—and that they should leave me in peace!”"}, {"page": 968, "text": "CHAPTER IV\nBald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolkónski’s estate, lay forty miles east from\nSmolénsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.\nThe same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alpátych,\nDessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the prince\nwas not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety, though from\nPrince Andrew’s letter it was evident that to remain at Bald Hills might be\ndangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter by Alpátych to the\nProvincial Governor at Smolénsk, asking him to let her know the state of\naffairs and the extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed.\nDessalles wrote this letter to the Governor for Princess Mary, she signed it,\nand it was given to Alpátych with instructions to hand it to the Governor\nand to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger.\nHaving received all his orders Alpátych, wearing a white beaver hat—a\npresent from the prince—and carrying a stick as the prince did, went out\naccompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans stood ready harnessed to a\nsmall conveyance with a leather hood.\nThe larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed with\npaper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive with ringing bells;\nbut on a long journey Alpátych liked to have them. His satellites—the\nsenior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery maid, a cook, two old\nwomen, a little pageboy, the coachman, and various domestic serfs—were\nseeing him off.\nHis daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to sit on and\nbehind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle, and one of\nthe coachmen helped him into the vehicle.\n“There! There! Women’s fuss! Women, women!” said Alpátych, puffing\nand speaking rapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed into the trap."}, {"page": 969, "text": "After giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, Alpátych, not\ntrying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald head and\ncrossed himself three times.\n“If there is anything... come back, Yákov Alpátych! For Christ’s sake\nthink of us!” cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war and the enemy.\n“Women, women! Women’s fuss!” muttered Alpátych to himself and\nstarted on his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the still-\ngreen, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black fields just being\nplowed a second time.\nAs he went along he looked with pleasure at the year’s splendid crop of\ncorn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were already\nbeing reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing and the harvest, and\nasked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the prince’s orders.\nHaving baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the town toward\nevening on the fourth of August.\nAlpátych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the\nroad. As he approached Smolénsk he heard the sounds of distant firing, but\nthese did not impress him. What struck him most was the sight of a splendid\nfield of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was being mown\ndown by the soldiers, evidently for fodder. This fact impressed Alpátych,\nbut in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it.\nAll the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been bounded\nby the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that limit. Everything\nnot connected with the execution of the prince’s orders did not interest and\ndid not even exist for Alpátych.\nOn reaching Smolénsk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up\nin the Gáchina suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by Ferapóntov,\nwhere he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years. Some\nthirty years ago Ferapóntov, by Alpátych’s advice, had bought a wood from\nthe prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an inn, and a corn\ndealer’s shop in that province. He was a stout, dark, red-faced peasant in the\nforties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a nose, similar knobs over his black\nfrowning brows, and a round belly.\nWearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferapóntov was standing\nbefore his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing Alpátych he went"}, {"page": 970, "text": "up to him.\n“You’re welcome, Yákov Alpátych. Folks are leaving the town, but you\nhave come to it,” said he.\n“Why are they leaving the town?” asked Alpátych.\n“That’s what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.”\n“Women’s fuss, women’s fuss!” said Alpátych.\n“Just what I think, Yákov Alpátych. What I say is: orders have been\ngiven not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants are asking\nthree rubles for carting—it isn’t Christian!”\nYákov Alpátych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for\nhay for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.\nAll night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning Alpátych\ndonned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business. It was a\nsunny morning and by eight o’clock it was already hot. “A good day for\nharvesting,” thought Alpátych.\nFrom beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At\neight o’clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry.\nMany people were hurrying through the streets and there were many\nsoldiers, but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their shops,\nand service was being held in the churches as usual. Alpátych went to the\nshops, to government offices, to the post office, and to the Governor’s. In\nthe offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking about the\narmy and about the enemy who was already attacking the town, everybody\nwas asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm one another.\nIn front of the Governor’s house Alpátych found a large number of\npeople, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor’s. At the porch\nhe met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an ex-\ncaptain of police, was saying angrily:\n“It’s no joke, you know! It’s all very well if you’re single. ‘One man\nthough undone is but one,’ as the proverb says, but with thirteen in your\nfamily and all the property... They’ve brought us to utter ruin! What sort of\ngovernors are they to do that? They ought to be hanged—the brigands!...”\n“Oh come, that’s enough!” said the other."}, {"page": 971, "text": "“What do I care? Let him hear! We’re not dogs,” said the ex-captain of\npolice, and looking round he noticed Alpátych.\n“Oh, Yákov Alpátych! What have you come for?”\n“To see the Governor by his excellency’s order,” answered Alpátych,\nlifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his coat as\nhe always did when he mentioned the prince.... “He has ordered me to\ninquire into the position of affairs,” he added.\n“Yes, go and find out!” shouted the angry gentleman. “They’ve brought\nthings to such a pass that there are no carts or anything!... There it is again,\ndo you hear?” said he, pointing in the direction whence came the sounds of\nfiring.\n“They’ve brought us all to ruin... the brigands!” he repeated, and\ndescended the porch steps.\nAlpátych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were\ntradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another. The door\nof the Governor’s room opened and they all rose and moved forward. An\nofficial ran out, said some words to a merchant, called a stout official with a\ncross hanging on his neck to follow him, and vanished again, evidently\nwishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions addressed to him.\nAlpátych moved forward and next time the official came out addressed him,\none hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat, and handed him two\nletters.\n“To his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince Bolkónski,” he\nannounced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned to\nhim and took the letters.\nA few minutes later the Governor received Alpátych and hurriedly said to\nhim:\n“Inform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on the\nhighest instructions—here...” and he handed a paper to Alpátych. “Still, as\nthe prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to Moscow. I am just\nstarting myself. Inform them...”\nBut the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into the\nroom and began to say something in French. The Governor’s face expressed\nterror."}, {"page": 972, "text": "“Go,” he said, nodding his head to Alpátych, and began questioning the\nofficer.\nEager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on Alpátych when he\ncame out of the Governor’s room. Involuntarily listening now to the firing,\nwhich had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength, Alpátych hurried to\nhis inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor said this:\n“I assure you that the town of Smolénsk is not in the slightest danger as\nyet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any. I from the one side\nand Prince Bagratión from the other are marching to unite our forces before\nSmolénsk, which junction will be effected on the 22nd instant, and both\narmies with their united forces will defend our compatriots of the province\nentrusted to your care till our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of\nour Fatherland, or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks has perished.\nFrom this you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure the\ninhabitants of Smolénsk, for those defended by two such brave armies may\nfeel assured of victory.” (Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch,\nthe civil governor of Smolénsk, 1812.)\nPeople were anxiously roaming about the streets.\nCarts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept\nemerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets. Loaded\ncarts stood at the house next to Ferapóntov’s and women were wailing and\nlamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round barking in\nfront of the harnessed horses.\nAlpátych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went\nstraight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman was\nasleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the passage.\nFrom the host’s room came the sounds of a child crying, the despairing sobs\nof a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of Ferapóntov. The cook began\nrunning hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen, just as\nAlpátych entered.\n“He’s done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged her\nabout so!...”\n“What for?” asked Alpátych.\n“She kept begging to go away. She’s a woman! ‘Take me away,’ says she,\n‘don’t let me perish with my little children! Folks,’ she says, ‘are all gone,"}, {"page": 973, "text": "so why,’ she says, ‘don’t we go?’ And he began beating and pulling her\nabout so!”\nAt these words Alpátych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to\nhear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper’s, where he\nhad left his purchases.\n“You brute, you murderer!” screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a\nbaby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through the\ndoor at that moment and down the steps into the yard.\nFerapóntov came out after her, but on seeing Alpátych adjusted his\nwaistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed Alpátych into the\nopposite room.\n“Going already?” said he.\nAlpátych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his packages\nand asked how much he owed.\n“We’ll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governor’s?” asked\nFerapóntov. “What has been decided?”\nAlpátych replied that the Governor had not told him anything definite.\n“With our business, how can we get away?” said Ferapóntov. “We’d have\nto pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogobúzh and I tell them they’re not\nChristians to ask it! Selivánov, now, did a good stroke last Thursday—sold\nflour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will you have some tea?” he added.\nWhile the horses were being harnessed Alpátych and Ferapóntov over\ntheir tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather for\nharvesting.\n“Well, it seems to be getting quieter,” remarked Ferapóntov, finishing his\nthird cup of tea and getting up. “Ours must have got the best of it. The\norders were not to let them in. So we’re in force, it seems.... They say the\nother day Matthew Iványch Plátov drove them into the river Márina and\ndrowned some eighteen thousand in one day.”\nAlpátych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who had\ncome in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels, hoofs, and\nbells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out.\nIt was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in shadow, the\nother half brightly lit by the sun. Alpátych looked out of the window and"}, {"page": 974, "text": "went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling and thud\nwas heard, followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull roar that set\nthe windows rattling.\nHe went out into the street: two men were running past toward the\nbridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of cannon\nballs and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds were hardly\nheard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town and\nattracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town was being\nbombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered up\nafter four o’clock. The people did not at once realize the meaning of this\nbombardment.\nAt first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused curiosity.\nFerapóntov’s wife, who till then had not ceased wailing under the shed,\nbecame quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate, listening to the\nsounds and looking in silence at the people.\nThe cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively curiosity\neveryone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over their\nheads. Several people came round the corner talking eagerly.\n“What force!” remarked one. “Knocked the roof and ceiling all to\nsplinters!”\n“Routed up the earth like a pig,” said another.\n“That’s grand, it bucks one up!” laughed the first. “Lucky you jumped\naside, or it would have wiped you out!”\nOthers joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had\nfallen on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now with\nthe swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the agreeable\nintermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people’s heads incessantly, but not\none fell close by, they all flew over. Alpátych was getting into his trap. The\ninnkeeper stood at the gate.\n“What are you staring at?” he shouted to the cook, who in her red skirt,\nwith sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to the corner\nto listen to what was being said.\n“What marvels!” she exclaimed, but hearing her master’s voice she\nturned back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt."}, {"page": 975, "text": "Once more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping\ndownwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the street,\nsomething exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.\n“Scoundrel, what are you doing?” shouted the innkeeper, rushing to the\ncook.\nAt that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different\nsides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently with\npale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing.\n“Oh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don’t let me die! My good\nsouls!...”\nFive minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her thigh\nbroken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen. Alpátych, his\ncoachman, Ferapóntov’s wife and children and the house porter were all\nsitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns, the whistling of projectiles,\nand the piteous moaning of the cook, which rose above the other sounds,\ndid not cease for a moment. The mistress rocked and hushed her baby and\nwhen anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had\nbecome of her husband who had remained in the street. A shopman who\nentered told her that her husband had gone with others to the cathedral,\nwhence they were fetching the wonder-working icon of Smolénsk.\nToward dusk the cannonade began to subside. Alpátych left the cellar and\nstopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was clouded\nwith smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon shone\nstrangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush seemed to\nreign over the town, broken only by the rustle of footsteps, the moaning, the\ndistant cries, and the crackle of fires which seemed widespread everywhere.\nThe cook’s moans had now subsided. On two sides black curling clouds of\nsmoke rose and spread from the fires. Through the streets soldiers in\nvarious uniforms walked or ran confusedly in different directions like ants\nfrom a ruined ant-hill. Several of them ran into Ferapóntov’s yard before\nAlpátych’s eyes. Alpátych went out to the gate. A retreating regiment,\nthronging and hurrying, blocked the street.\nNoticing him, an officer said: “The town is being abandoned. Get away,\nget away!” and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:\n“I’ll teach you to run into the yards!”"}, {"page": 976, "text": "Alpátych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him to\nset off. Ferapóntov’s whole household came out too, following Alpátych\nand the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then, suddenly\nbegan to wail as they looked at the fires—the smoke and even the flames of\nwhich could be seen in the failing twilight—and as if in reply the same kind\nof lamentation was heard from other parts of the street. Inside the shed\nAlpátych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and traces of their\nhorses with trembling hands.\nAs Alpátych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in\nFerapóntov’s open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and knapsacks\nwith flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferapóntov returned and entered\nhis shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at them, but suddenly\nstopped and, clutching at his hair, burst into sobs and laughter:\n“Loot everything, lads! Don’t let those devils get it!” he cried, taking\nsome bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.\nSome of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on filling\ntheir bags. On seeing Alpátych, Ferapóntov turned to him:\n“Russia is done for!” he cried. “Alpátych, I’ll set the place on fire myself.\nWe’re done for!...” and Ferapóntov ran into the yard.\nSoldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking it\ncompletely, so that Alpátych could not pass out and had to wait.\nFerapóntov’s wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till it was\npossible to drive out.\nNight had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out\namid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the Dnieper\nAlpátych’s cart and that of the innkeeper’s wife, which were slowly moving\namid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had to stop. In a side street\nnear the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped, a house and some shops\nwere on fire. This fire was already burning itself out. The flames now died\ndown and were lost in the black smoke, now suddenly flared up again\nbrightly, lighting up with strange distinctness the faces of the people\ncrowding at the crossroads. Black figures flitted about before the fire, and\nthrough the incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be\nheard. Seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some time,\nAlpátych got down and turned into the side street to look at the fire.\nSoldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near it, and he"}, {"page": 977, "text": "saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into\nanother yard across the street, while others carried bundles of hay.\nAlpátych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was\nblazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen in,\nthe wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters were alight. The crowd was\nevidently watching for the roof to fall in, and Alpátych watched for it too.\n“Alpátych!” a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.\n“Mercy on us! Your excellency!” answered Alpátych, immediately\nrecognizing the voice of his young prince.\nPrince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was\nlooking at Alpátych from the back of the crowd.\n“Why are you here?” he asked.\n“Your... your excellency,” stammered Alpátych and broke into sobs. “Are\nwe really lost? Master!...”\n“Why are you here?” Prince Andrew repeated.\nAt that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master’s pale\nworn face. Alpátych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it\nwas to get away.\n“Are we really quite lost, your excellency?” he asked again.\nPrince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee\nbegan writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his sister:\n“Smolénsk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the enemy\nwithin a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at once when\nyou will start. Send by special messenger to Usvyázh.”\nHaving written this and given the paper to Alpátych, he told him how to\narrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the boy’s tutor,\nand how and where to let him know immediately. Before he had had time to\nfinish giving these instructions, a chief of staff followed by a suite galloped\nup to him.\n“You are a colonel?” shouted the chief of staff with a German accent, in a\nvoice familiar to Prince Andrew. “Houses are set on fire in your presence\nand you stand by!

Heat\nand drought had continued for more than three weeks. Each day fleecy\nclouds floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun, but toward\nevening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish-brown mist. Heavy\nnight dews alone refreshed the earth. The unreaped corn was scorched and\nshed its grain. The marshes dried up. The cattle lowed from hunger, finding\nno food on the sun-parched meadows. Only at night and in the forests while\nthe dew lasted was there any freshness. But on the road, the highroad along\nwhich the troops marched, there was no such freshness even at night or\nwhen the road passed through the forest; the dew was imperceptible on the\nsandy dust churned up more than six inches deep. As soon as day dawned\nthe march began. The artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly\nthrough the deep dust that rose to the very hubs of the wheels, and the\ninfantry sank ankle-deep in that soft, choking, hot dust that never cooled\neven at night. Some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while\nthe rest rose and hung like a cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears,\nhair, and nostrils, and worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they\nmoved along that road. The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of\ndust, and through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with\nnaked eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the\nunclouded sky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless\natmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and\nmouths. When they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells and\nfought for the water and drank it down to the mud.\nPrince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of\nthat regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving and\ngiving orders, engrossed him. The burning of Smolénsk and its"}, {"page": 980, "text": "abandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger against the\nfoe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely devoted to the affairs\nof his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and officers. In the\nregiment they called him “our prince,” were proud of him and loved him.\nBut he was kind and gentle only to those of his regiment, to Timókhin and\nthe like—people quite new to him, belonging to a different world and who\ncould not know and understand his past. As soon as he came across a\nformer acquaintance or anyone from the staff, he bristled up immediately\nand grew spiteful, ironical, and contemptuous. Everything that reminded\nhim of his past was repugnant to him, and so in his relations with that\nformer circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not to be\nunfair.\nIn truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to Prince\nAndrew, especially after the abandonment of Smolénsk on the sixth of\nAugust (he considered that it could and should have been defended) and\nafter his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to pillage his\ndearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled. But despite this,\nthanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to think about\nentirely apart from general questions. Two days previously he had received\nnews that his father, son, and sister had left for Moscow; and though there\nwas nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince Andrew with a characteristic\ndesire to foment his own grief decided that he must ride there.\nHe ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the\nmarch, rode to his father’s estate where he had been born and spent his\nchildhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of\nwomen chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden beetles,\nPrince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that the little\nwashing wharf, torn from its place and half submerged, was floating on its\nside in the middle of the pond. He rode to the keeper’s lodge. No one was at\nthe stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood open. Grass had\nalready begun to grow on the garden paths, and horses and calves were\nstraying in the English park. Prince Andrew rode up to the hothouse; some\nof the glass panes were broken, and of the trees in tubs some were\noverturned and others dried up. He called for Tarás the gardener, but no one\nreplied. Having gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental\ngarden, he saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the\nplum trees had been torn off with the fruit. An old peasant whom Prince"}, {"page": 981, "text": "Andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was sitting on a green\ngarden seat, plaiting a bast shoe.\nHe was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting on\nthe seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him strips of bast\nwere hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia.\nPrince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old garden had\nbeen cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of\nthe house among the rosebushes. The shutters were all closed, except at one\nwindow which was open. A little serf boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran into\nthe house. Alpátych, having sent his family away, was alone at Bald Hills\nand was sitting indoors reading the Lives of the Saints. On hearing that\nPrince Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles on his nose,\nbuttoning his coat, and, hastily stepping up, without a word began weeping\nand kissing Prince Andrew’s knee.\nThen, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to report on\nthe position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable had been removed\nto Boguchárovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted away. The\nhay and the spring corn, of which Alpátych said there had been a\nremarkable crop that year, had been commandeered by the troops and\nmown down while still green. The peasants were ruined; some of them too\nhad gone to Boguchárovo, only a few remained.\nWithout waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:\n“When did my father and sister leave?” meaning when did they leave for\nMoscow.\nAlpátych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for\nBoguchárovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again went into\ndetails concerning the estate management, asking for instructions.\n“Am I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them? We\nhave still six hundred quarters left,” he inquired.\n“What am I to say to him?” thought Prince Andrew, looking down on the\nold man’s bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on his\nface that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions were\nand only asked them to allay his grief.\n“Yes, let them have it,” replied Prince Andrew."}, {"page": 982, "text": "“If you noticed some disorder in the garden,” said Alpátych, “it was\nimpossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent the\nnight, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their\ncommanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it.”\n“Well, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy\noccupies the place?” asked Prince Andrew.\nAlpátych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and suddenly\nwith a solemn gesture raised his arm.\n“He is my refuge! His will be done!” he exclaimed.\nA group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow\ntoward the prince.\n“Well, good-by!” said Prince Andrew, bending over to Alpátych. “You\nmust go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the\nRyazán estate or to the one near Moscow.”\nAlpátych clung to Prince Andrew’s leg and burst into sobs. Gently\ndisengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the avenue\nat a gallop.\nThe old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly\nimpassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on which\nhe was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running out from the hot\nhouse carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from the trees there,\ncame upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young master, the elder one with\nfrightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand and hid with\nher behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some green plums they had\ndropped.\nPrince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them see\nthat they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty frightened little\ngirl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so.\nA new sensation of comfort and relief came over him when, seeing these\ngirls, he realized the existence of other human interests entirely aloof from\nhis own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him. Evidently these\ngirls passionately desired one thing—to carry away and eat those green\nplums without being caught—and Prince Andrew shared their wish for the\nsuccess of their enterprise. He could not resist looking at them once more.\nBelieving their danger past, they sprang from their ambush and, chirruping"}, {"page": 983, "text": "something in their shrill little voices and holding up their skirts, their bare\nlittle sunburned feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow\ngrass.\nPrince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty\nhighroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from Bald Hills\nhe again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting place\nby the dam of a small pond. It was past one o’clock. The sun, a red ball\nthrough the dust, burned and scorched his back intolerably through his\nblack coat. The dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk that\ncame from the resting troops. There was no wind. As he crossed the dam\nPrince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the pond. He longed to\nget into that water, however dirty it might be, and he glanced round at the\npool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter. The small, muddy,\ngreen pond had risen visibly more than a foot, flooding the dam, because it\nwas full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick-red hands, necks,\nand faces, who were splashing about in it. All this naked white human flesh,\nlaughing and shrieking, floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed\ninto a watering can, and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering\nmass rendered it specially pathetic.\nOne fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince\nAndrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed\nhimself, stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water;\nanother, a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood up\nto his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted\nwith satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands blackened\nto the wrists. There were sounds of men slapping one another, yelling, and\npuffing.\nEverywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was healthy,\nwhite, muscular flesh. The officer, Timókhin, with his red little nose,\nstanding on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing the\nprince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless.\n“It’s very nice, your excellency! Wouldn’t you like to?” said he.\n“It’s dirty,” replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.\n“We’ll clear it out for you in a minute,” said Timókhin, and, still\nundressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.\n“The prince wants to bathe.”"}, {"page": 984, "text": "“What prince? Ours?” said many voices, and the men were in such haste\nto clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He decided that he\nwould rather wash himself with water in the barn.\n“Flesh, bodies, cannon fodder!” he thought, and he looked at his own\nnaked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust and\nhorror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that immense\nnumber of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.\nOn the seventh of August Prince Bagratión wrote as follows from his\nquarters at Mikháylovna on the Smolénsk road:\nDear Count Aléxis Andréevich—(He was writing to Arakchéev but knew\nthat his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore weighed every\nword in it to the best of his ability.)\nI expect the Minister (Barclay de Tolly) has already reported the\nabandonment of Smolénsk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and the\nwhole army is in despair that this most important place has been wantonly\nabandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most urgently and finally\nwrote him, but nothing would induce him to consent. I swear to you on my\nhonor that Napoleon was in such a fix as never before and might have lost\nhalf his army but could not have taken Smolénsk. Our troops fought, and\nare fighting, as never before. With fifteen thousand men I held the enemy at\nbay for thirty-five hours and beat him; but he would not hold out even for\nfourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain on our army, and as for him, he\nought, it seems to me, not to live. If he reports that our losses were great, it\nis not true; perhaps about four thousand, not more, and not even that; but\neven were they ten thousand, that’s war! But the enemy has lost masses....\nWhat would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They\nwould have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water for men\nor horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but suddenly sent\ninstructions that he was retiring that night. We cannot fight in this way, or\nwe may soon bring the enemy to Moscow....\nThere is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you\nshould make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats! You\nwould set all Russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed to\nwear the uniform.

To the latter—as distinguished from\nvillage, country, provincial, or even Moscow life—we may allot Petersburg\nlife, and especially the life of its salons. That life of the salons is\nunchanging. Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had again\nquarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade them\nagain, but the salons of Anna Pávlovna and Hélène remained just as they\nhad been—the one seven and the other five years before. At Anna\nPávlovna’s they talked with perplexity of Bonaparte’s successes just as\nbefore and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the\nEuropean sovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was\nto cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna\nPávlovna was the representative. And in Hélène’s salon, which Rumyántsev\nhimself honored with his visits, regarding Hélène as a remarkably\nintelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808 of\nthe “great nation” and the “great man,” and regretted our rupture with\nFrance, a rupture which, according to them, ought to be promptly\nterminated by peace.\nOf late, since the Emperor’s return from the army, there had been some\nexcitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of\nhostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency. In Anna\nPávlovna’s circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were deep-\nrooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the effect that one\nought not to go to the French theater and that to maintain the French troupe\nwas costing the government as much as a whole army corps. The progress\nof the war was eagerly followed, and only the reports most flattering to our\narmy were circulated. In the French circle of Hélène and Rumyántsev the\nreports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted and all"}, {"page": 987, "text": "Napoleon’s attempts at conciliation were discussed. In that circle they\ndiscountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for a removal to\nKazán of the court and the girls’ educational establishments under the\npatronage of the Dowager Empress. In Hélène’s circle the war in general\nwas regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would very soon\nend in peace, and the view prevailed expressed by Bilíbin—who now in\nPetersburg was quite at home in Hélène’s house, which every clever man\nwas obliged to visit—that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it\nwould matters be settled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm—news of\nwhich had reached Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor’s return—\nwas ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.\nAnna Pávlovna’s circle on the contrary was enraptured by this\nenthusiasm and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients.\nPrince Vasíli, who still occupied his former important posts, formed a\nconnecting link between these two circles. He visited his “good friend Anna\nPávlovna” as well as his daughter’s “diplomatic salon,” and often in his\nconstant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and\nsaid at Hélène’s what he should have said at Anna Pávlovna’s and vice\nversa.\nSoon after the Emperor’s return Prince Vasíli in a conversation about the\nwar at Anna Pávlovna’s severely condemned Barclay de Tolly, but was\nundecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief. One of the\nvisitors, usually spoken of as “a man of great merit,” having described how\nhe had that day seen Kutúzov, the newly chosen chief of the Petersburg\nmilitia, presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the Treasury, cautiously\nventured to suggest that Kutúzov would be the man to satisfy all\nrequirements.\nAnna Pávlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kutúzov had\ndone nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.\n“I have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility,” Prince Vasíli\ninterrupted, “but they did not listen to me. I told them his election as chief\nof the militia would not please the Emperor. They did not listen to me.\n“It’s all this mania for opposition,” he went on. “And who for? It is all\nbecause we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Muscovites,” Prince\nVasíli continued, forgetting for a moment that though at Hélène’s one had to\nridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna Pávlovna’s one had to be ecstatic"}, {"page": 988, "text": "about it. But he retrieved his mistake at once. “Now, is it suitable that Count\nKutúzov, the oldest general in Russia, should preside at that tribunal? He\nwill get nothing for his pains! How could they make a man commander in\nchief who cannot mount a horse, who drops asleep at a council, and has the\nvery worst morals! A good reputation he made for himself at Bucharest! I\ndon’t speak of his capacity as a general, but at a time like this how they\nappoint a decrepit, blind old man, positively blind? A fine idea to have a\nblind general! He can’t see anything. To play blindman’s buff? He can’t see\nat all!”\nNo one replied to his remarks.\nThis was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the twenty-\nninth of July Kutúzov received the title of Prince. This might indicate a\nwish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince Vasíli’s opinion continued to be\ncorrect though he was not now in any hurry to express it. But on the eighth\nof August a committee, consisting of Field Marshal Saltykóv, Arakchéev,\nVyazmítinov, Lopukhín, and Kochubéy met to consider the progress of the\nwar. This committee came to the conclusion that our failures were due to a\nwant of unity in the command and though the members of the committee\nwere aware of the Emperor’s dislike of Kutúzov, after a short deliberation\nthey agreed to advise his appointment as commander in chief. That same\nday Kutúzov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the\narmies and over the whole region occupied by them.\nOn the ninth of August Prince Vasíli at Anna Pávlovna’s again met the\n“man of great merit.” The latter was very attentive to Anna Pávlovna\nbecause he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational\nestablishments for young ladies. Prince Vasíli entered the room with the air\nof a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires.\n“Well, have you heard the great news? Prince Kutúzov is field marshal!\nAll dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At last we have a\nman!” said he, glancing sternly and significantly round at everyone in the\ndrawing room.\nThe “man of great merit,” despite his desire to obtain the post of director,\ncould not refrain from reminding Prince Vasíli of his former opinion.\nThough this was impolite to Prince Vasíli in Anna Pávlovna’s drawing\nroom, and also to Anna Pávlovna herself who had received the news with\ndelight, he could not resist the temptation."}, {"page": 989, "text": "“But, Prince, they say he is blind!” said he, reminding Prince Vasíli of his\nown words.\n“Eh?

He is a second autocrat,” he concluded with a victorious smile.\n“God grant it! God grant it!” said Anna Pávlovna.\nThe “man of great merit,” who was still a novice in court circles, wishing\nto flatter Anna Pávlovna by defending her former position on this question,\nobserved:\n“It is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kutúzov those powers.\nThey say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read, when he said to\nKutúzov: ‘Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor.’”\n“Perhaps the heart took no part in that speech,” said Anna Pávlovna.\n“Oh, no, no!” warmly rejoined Prince Vasíli, who would not now yield\nKutúzov to anyone; in his opinion Kutúzov was not only admirable himself,\nbut was adored by everybody. “No, that’s impossible,” said he, “for our\nsovereign appreciated him so highly before.”\n“God grant only that Prince Kutúzov assumes real power and does not\nallow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel,” observed Anna Pávlovna.\nUnderstanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vasíli said in a\nwhisper:\n“I know for a fact that Kutúzov made it an absolute condition that the\nTsarévich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to the\nEmperor?”\nAnd Prince Vasíli repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by\nKutúzov to the Emperor. “I can neither punish him if he does wrong nor\nreward him if he does right.”\n“Oh, a very wise man is Prince Kutúzov!

He is as right as\nother historians who look for the explanation of historic events in the will of\none man; he is as right as the Russian historians who maintain that\nNapoleon was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the Russian commanders.\nHere besides the law of retrospection, which regards all the past as a\npreparation for events that subsequently occur, the law of reciprocity comes\nin, confusing the whole matter.

How much more complex than this is the game of war,\nwhich occurs under certain limits of time, and where it is not one will that\nmanipulates lifeless objects, but everything results from innumerable\nconflicts of various wills!\nAfter Smolénsk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogobúzh at\nVyázma, and then at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche, but it happened that owing to a\nconjunction of innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give\nbattle till they reached Borodinó, seventy miles from Moscow.

He is\na very shrewd and garrulous fellow.”\nNapoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the\nman to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped\noff, and an hour later, Lavrúshka, the serf Denísov had handed over to\nRostóv, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly’s jacket and on a French cavalry\nsaddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told him to ride by his side\nand began questioning him.\n“You are a Cossack?”\n“Yes, a Cossack, your Honor.”\n“The Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleon’s\nplain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental mind\nthe presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the incidents\nof the war,” says Thiers, narrating this episode. In reality Lavrúshka, having\ngot drunk the day before and left his master dinnerless, had been whipped\nand sent to the village in quest of chickens, where he engaged in looting till\nthe French took him prisoner. Lavrúshka was one of those coarse, bare-\nfaced lackeys who have seen all sorts of things, consider it necessary to do\neverything in a mean and cunning way, are ready to render any sort of\nservice to their master, and are keen at guessing their master’s baser\nimpulses, especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness.\nFinding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had\neasily and surely recognized, Lavrúshka was not in the least abashed but\nmerely did his utmost to gain his new master’s favor.\nHe knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon’s presence\ncould no more intimidate him than Rostóv’s, or a sergeant major’s with the"}, {"page": 993, "text": "rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major or\nNapoleon could deprive him of.\nSo he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the orderlies.\nMuch of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the Russians\nthought they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavrúshka screwed up his eyes\nand considered.\nIn this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see cunning in\neverything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.\n“It’s like this,” he said thoughtfully, “if there’s a battle soon, yours will\nwin. That’s right. But if three days pass, then after that, well, then that same\nbattle will not soon be over.”\nLelorgne d’Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus:\n“If a battle takes place within the next three days the French will win, but if\nlater, God knows what will happen.” Napoleon did not smile, though he\nwas evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words to be\nrepeated.\nLavrúshka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending not to\nknow who Napoleon was, added:\n“We know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in\nthe world, but we are a different matter...”—without knowing why or how\nthis bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.\nThe interpreter translated these words without the last phrase, and\nBonaparte smiled. “The young Cossack made his mighty interlocutor\nsmile,” says Thiers.

She refused to go\naway and her father’s fury broke over her in a terrible storm. He repeated\nevery injustice he had ever inflicted on her. Trying to convict her, he told\nher she had worn him out, had caused his quarrel with his son, had harbored\nnasty suspicions of him, making it the object of her life to poison his\nexistence, and he drove her from his study telling her that if she did not go\naway it was all the same to him.

A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving\ntoward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by the armpits\nand dragging along a little old man in a uniform and decorations.

He was lifted up, carried to his\nstudy, and laid on the very couch he had so feared of late.\nThe doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said that the\nprince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.\nIt was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and\nnext day they moved the prince to Boguchárovo, the doctor accompanying\nhim.\nBy the time they reached Boguchárovo, Dessalles and the little prince\nhad already left for Moscow.\nFor three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new house\nPrince Andrew had built at Boguchárovo, ever in the same state, getting\nneither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay like a distorted\ncorpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips twitching, and it\nwas impossible to tell whether he understood what was going on around\nhim or not. One thing was certain—that he was suffering and wished to say\nsomething. But what it was, no one could tell: it might be some caprice of a\nsick and half-crazy man, or it might relate to public affairs, or possibly to\nfamily concerns.\nThe doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due to\nphysical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell her something,\nand the fact that her presence always increased his restlessness confirmed\nher opinion."}, {"page": 997, "text": "He was evidently suffering both physically and mentally.

And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since her father’s\nillness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed with him expecting\nsomething to happen), all the personal desires and hopes that had been\nforgotten or sleeping within her had awakened. Thoughts that had not\nentered her mind for years—thoughts of a life free from the fear of her\nfather, and even the possibility of love and of family happiness—floated\ncontinually in her imagination like temptations of the devil. Thrust them\naside as she would, questions continually recurred to her as to how she\nwould order her life now, after that. These were temptations of the devil and\nPrincess Mary knew it. She knew that the sole weapon against him was\nprayer, and she tried to pray. She assumed an attitude of prayer, looked at\nthe icons, repeated the words of a prayer, but she could not pray.

They differed from them in speech, dress, and disposition. They\nwere called steppe peasants. The old prince used to approve of them for\ntheir endurance at work when they came to Bald Hills to help with the\nharvest. or to dig ponds and ditches, but he disliked them for their\nboorishness.\nPrince Andrew’s last stay at Boguchárovo, when he introduced hospitals\nand schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay, had not\nsoftened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them the\ntraits of character the old prince called boorishness. Various obscure rumors\nwere always current among them: at one time a rumor that they would all\nbe enrolled as Cossacks; at another of a new religion to which they were all\nto be converted; then of some proclamation of the Tsar’s and of an oath to\nthe Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which it was rumored that\nfreedom had been granted them but the landowners had stopped it), then of\nPeter Fëdorovich’s return to the throne in seven years’ time, when\neverything would be made free and so “simple” that there would be no\nrestrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and his invasion were\nconnected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of Antichrist,\nthe end of the world, and “pure freedom.”\nIn the vicinity of Boguchárovo were large villages belonging to the\ncrown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they\npleased. There were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and\nalso very few domestic or literate serfs, and in the lives of the peasantry of\nthose parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the Russian people,\nthe causes and meaning of which are so baffling to contemporaries, were\nmore clearly and strongly noticeable than among others. One instance,\nwhich had occurred some twenty years before, was a movement among the"}, {"page": 1005, "text": "peasants to emigrate to some unknown “warm rivers.” Hundreds of\npeasants, among them the Boguchárovo folk, suddenly began selling their\ncattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast. As birds migrate\nto somewhere beyond the sea, so these men with their wives and children\nstreamed to the southeast, to parts where none of them had ever been. They\nset off in caravans, bought their freedom one by one or ran away, and drove\nor walked toward the “warm rivers.” Many of them were punished, some\nsent to Siberia, many died of cold and hunger on the road, many returned of\ntheir own accord, and the movement died down of itself just as it had\nsprung up, without apparent reason. But such undercurrents still existed\namong the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest themselves\njust as strangely, unexpectedly, and at the same time simply, naturally, and\nforcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone living in close touch with these people it\nwas apparent that these undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an\neruption.\nAlpátych, who had reached Boguchárovo shortly before the old prince’s\ndeath, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that contrary to what\nwas happening in the Bald Hills district, where over a radius of forty miles\nall the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages to be\ndevastated by the Cossacks, the peasants in the steppe region round\nBoguchárovo were, it was rumored, in touch with the French, received\nleaflets from them that passed from hand to hand, and did not migrate. He\nlearned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant Karp, who\npossessed great influence in the village commune and had recently been\naway driving a government transport, had returned with news that the\nCossacks were destroying deserted villages, but that the French did not\nharm them. Alpátych also knew that on the previous day another peasant\nhad even brought from the village of Visloúkhovo, which was occupied by\nthe French, a proclamation by a French general that no harm would be done\nto the inhabitants, and if they remained they would be paid for anything\ntaken from them. As proof of this the peasant had brought from\nVisloúkhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that they were\nfalse) paid to him in advance for hay.\nMore important still, Alpátych learned that on the morning of the very\nday he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the princess’\nluggage from Boguchárovo, there had been a village meeting at which it\nhad been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no time to waste."}, {"page": 1006, "text": "On the fifteenth, the day of the old prince’s death, the Marshal had insisted\non Princess Mary’s leaving at once, as it was becoming dangerous.

But this he was unable to\ndo, for he received tidings that the French had unexpectedly advanced, and\nhad barely time to remove his own family and valuables from his estate.\nFor some thirty years Boguchárovo had been managed by the village\nElder, Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive “Drónushka.”\nDron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who\ngrow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are\nsixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth, as straight and\nstrong at sixty as at thirty.\nSoon after the migration to the “warm rivers,” in which he had taken part\nlike the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of Boguchárovo,\nand had since filled that post irreproachably for twenty-three years.

The masters, both the\nold prince and the young, and the steward respected him and jestingly\ncalled him “the Minister.” During the whole time of his service Dron had\nnever been drunk or ill, never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had\nhe shown the least fatigue, and though he could not read he had never\nforgotten a single money account or the number of quarters of flour in any\nof the endless cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of the\nwhole corn crop on any single acre of the Boguchárovo fields.\nAlpátych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for his\nDron on the day of the prince’s funeral and told him to have twelve horses\ngot ready for the princess’ carriages and eighteen carts for the things to be\nremoved from Boguchárovo. Though the peasants paid quitrent, Alpátych\nthought no difficulty would be made about complying with this order, for\nthere were two hundred and thirty households at work in Boguchárovo and\nthe peasants were well to do. But on hearing the order Dron lowered his\neyes and remained silent. Alpátych named certain peasants he knew, from\nwhom he told him to take the carts.\nDron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting.\nAlpátych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no horses\navailable: some horses were carting for the government, others were too"}, {"page": 1007, "text": "weak, and others had died for want of fodder. It seemed that no horses\ncould be had even for the carriages, much less for the carting.\nAlpátych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a model\nvillage Elder, so Alpátych had not managed the prince’s estates for twenty\nyears in vain. He was a model steward, possessing in the highest degree the\nfaculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt with. Having\nglanced at Dron he at once understood that his answers did not express his\npersonal views but the general mood of the Boguchárovo commune, by\nwhich the Elder had already been carried away. But he also knew that Dron,\nwho had acquired property and was hated by the commune, must be\nhesitating between the two camps: the masters’ and the serfs’. He noticed\nthis hesitation in Dron’s look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to\nhim.\n“Now just listen, Drónushka,” said he. “Don’t talk nonsense to me. His\nexcellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people\naway and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order from the\nTsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you hear?”\n“I hear,” Dron answered without lifting his eyes.\nAlpátych was not satisfied with this reply.\n“Eh, Dron, it will turn out badly!” he said, shaking his head.\n“The power is in your hands,” Dron rejoined sadly.\n“Eh, Dron, drop it!” Alpátych repeated, withdrawing his hand from his\nbosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron’s feet. “I can see through\nyou and three yards into the ground under you,” he continued, gazing at the\nfloor in front of Dron.\nDron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alpátych and again lowered\nhis eyes.\n“You drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their\nhomes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning for\nthe princess’ things. And don’t go to any meeting yourself, do you hear?”\nDron suddenly fell on his knees.\n“Yákov Alpátych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge\nme, for Christ’s sake!”"}, {"page": 1008, "text": "“Stop that!” cried Alpátych sternly. “I see through you and three yards\nunder you,” he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, his\nknowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that he had been\nable to retain the old prince’s favor for twenty years had long since gained\nhim the reputation of being a wizard, and that the power of seeing three\nyards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards.\nDron got up and was about to say something, but Alpátych interrupted\nhim.\n“What is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you thinking of,\neh?”\n“What am I to do with the people?” said Dron. “They’re quite beside\nthemselves; I have already told them...”\n“‘Told them,’ I dare say!” said Alpátych. “Are they drinking?” he asked\nabruptly.\n“Quite beside themselves, Yákov Alpátych; they’ve fetched another\nbarrel.”\n“Well, then, listen! I’ll go to the police officer, and you tell them so, and\nthat they must stop this and the carts must be got ready.”\n“I understand.”\nAlpátych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long time\nand knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion that\nthey can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive “I understand” from\nDron, Alpátych contented himself with that, though he not only doubted but\nfelt almost certain that without the help of troops the carts would not be\nforthcoming.\nAnd so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided. In the\nvillage, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being held, which\ndecided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the carts\nshould not be provided. Without saying anything of this to the princess,\nAlpátych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which had arrived\nfrom Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for the princess’ carriages.\nMeanwhile he went himself to the police authorities."}, {"page": 1009, "text": "CHAPTER X\nAfter her father’s funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and\ndid not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that Alpátych was\nasking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk with\nDron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been\nlying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away\nand begged to be left in peace.\nThe windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward. She\nlay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons of the leather\ncushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her confused thoughts\nwere centered on one subject—the irrevocability of death and her own\nspiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, but which had shown itself\nduring her father’s illness. She wished to pray but did not dare to, dared not\nin her present state of mind address herself to God. She lay for a long time\nin that position.\nThe sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting rays\nshone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of the morocco\ncushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of her thoughts\nsuddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed her hair, got up, and\nwent to the window, involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the clear but\nwindy evening.\n“Yes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will\nhinder you,” she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her head fall\non the window sill.\nSomeone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and\nkissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black\ndress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary, sighed, kissed her,\nand immediately began to cry. The princess looked up at her. All their\nformer disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind. But she"}, {"page": 1010, "text": "remembered too how he had changed of late toward Mademoiselle\nBourienne and could not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were\nthe reproaches Princess Mary had mentally addressed to her. “Besides, is it\nfor me, for me who desired his death, to condemn anyone?” she thought.\nPrincess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of Mademoiselle\nBourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but who yet was\ndependent on her and living in her house. She felt sorry for her and held out\nher hand with a glance of gentle inquiry. Mademoiselle Bourienne at once\nbegan crying again and kissed that hand, speaking of the princess’ sorrow\nand making herself a partner in it. She said her only consolation was the\nfact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow, that all the old\nmisunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief; that she felt\nherself blameless in regard to everyone, and that he, from above, saw her\naffection and gratitude. The princess heard her, not heeding her words but\noccasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her voice.\n“Your position is doubly terrible, dear princess,” said Mademoiselle\nBourienne after a pause. “I understand that you could not, and cannot, think\nof yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has Alpátych been to\nyou? Has he spoken to you of going away?” she asked.\nPrincess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go or\nwhere to. “Is it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it not all the\nsame?” she thought, and did not reply.\n“You know, chère Marie,” said Mademoiselle Bourienne, “that we are in\ndanger—are surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move now.\nIf we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God knows...”\nPrincess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she\nwas talking about.\n“Oh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now,” she said.\n“Of course I would on no account wish to go away from him.... Alpátych\ndid say something about going.... Speak to him; I can do nothing, nothing,\nand don’t want to....”\n“I’ve spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away\ntomorrow, but I think it would now be better to stay here,” said\nMademoiselle Bourienne. “Because, you will agree, chère Marie, to fall\ninto the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible.”"}, {"page": 1011, "text": "Mademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not\nprinted on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau’s, telling people not\nto leave their homes and that the French authorities would afford them\nproper protection. She handed this to the princess.\n“I think it would be best to appeal to that general,” she continued, “and I\nam sure that all due respect would be shown you.”\nPrincess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled\nsobs.\n“From whom did you get this?” she asked.\n“They probably recognized that I am French, by my name,” replied\nMademoiselle Bourienne blushing.\nPrincess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window and\nwith a pale face went out of the room and into what had been Prince\nAndrew’s study.\n“Dunyásha, send Alpátych, or Drónushka, or somebody to me!” she said,\n“and tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me,” she added, hearing\nMademoiselle Bourienne’s voice. “We must go at once, at once!” she said,\nappalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the French.\n“If Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French! That I, the\ndaughter of Prince Nicholas Bolkónski, asked General Rameau for\nprotection and accepted his favor!” This idea horrified her, made her\nshudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never\nexperienced before. All that was distressing, and especially all that was\nhumiliating, in her position rose vividly to her mind. “They, the French,\nwould settle in this house: M. le Général Rameau would occupy Prince\nAndrew’s study and amuse himself by looking through and reading his\nletters and papers. Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors of\nBoguchárovo for him. I should be given a small room as a favor, the\nsoldiers would violate my father’s newly dug grave to steal his crosses and\nstars, they would tell me of their victories over the Russians, and would\npretend to sympathize with my sorrow...” thought Princess Mary, not\nthinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her\nbrother. For herself she did not care where she remained or what happened\nto her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead father and of Prince\nAndrew. Involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings.\nWhat they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound"}, {"page": 1012, "text": "to say and do. She went into Prince Andrew’s study, trying to enter\ncompletely into his ideas, and considered her position.\nThe demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her father’s\ndeath, all at once rose before her with a new, previously unknown force and\ntook possession of her.\nAgitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael\nIvánovich and now for Tíkhon or Dron. Dunyásha, the nurse, and the other\nmaids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne’s statement was\ncorrect. Alpátych was not at home, he had gone to the police. Neither could\nthe architect Michael Ivánovich, who on being sent for came in with sleepy\neyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With just the same smile of agreement\nwith which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old\nprince without expressing views of his own, he now replied to Princess\nMary, so that nothing definite could be got from his answers. The old valet\nTíkhon, with sunken, emaciated face that bore the stamp of inconsolable\ngrief, replied: “Yes, Princess” to all Princess Mary’s questions and hardly\nrefrained from sobbing as he looked at her.\nAt length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a deep bow\nto Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.\nPrincess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of\nhim.\n“Drónushka,” she said, regarding as a sure friend this Drónushka who\nalways used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the fair\nat Vyázma every year and smilingly offer it to her, “Drónushka, now since\nour misfortune...” she began, but could not go on.\n“We are all in God’s hands,” said he, with a sigh.\nThey were silent for a while.\n“Drónushka, Alpátych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to turn\nto. Is it true, as they tell me, that I can’t even go away?”\n“Why shouldn’t you go away, your excellency? You can go,” said Dron.\n“I was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend, I\ncan do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go away\ntonight or early tomorrow morning.”\nDron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: “There are\nno horses; I told Yákov Alpátych so.”"}, {"page": 1013, "text": "“Why are there none?” asked the princess.\n“It’s all God’s scourge,” said Dron. “What horses we had have been taken\nfor the army or have died—this is such a year! It’s not a case of feeding\nhorses—we may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some go three days\nwithout eating. We’ve nothing, we’ve been ruined.”\nPrincess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.\n“The peasants are ruined? They have no bread?” she asked.\n“They’re dying of hunger,” said Dron. “It’s not a case of carting.”\n“But why didn’t you tell me, Drónushka? Isn’t it possible to help them?\nI’ll do all I can....”\nTo Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such sorrow\nwas filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor, and the rich could\nrefrain from helping the poor. She had heard vaguely that there was such a\nthing as “landlord’s corn” which was sometimes given to the peasants. She\nalso knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help the\npeasants in need, she only feared to make some mistake in speaking about\nthe distribution of the grain she wished to give. She was glad such cares\npresented themselves, enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief.\nShe began asking Dron about the peasants’ needs and what there was in\nBoguchárovo that belonged to the landlord.\n“But we have grain belonging to my brother?” she said.\n“The landlord’s grain is all safe,” replied Dron proudly. “Our prince did\nnot order it to be sold.”\n“Give it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you leave in\nmy brother’s name,” said she.\nDron made no answer but sighed deeply.\n“Give them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all. I give this\norder in my brother’s name; and tell them that what is ours is theirs. We do\nnot grudge them anything. Tell them so.”\nDron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.\n“Discharge me, little mother, for God’s sake!

I’ll go out to them,” said Princess Mary, and in spite of the\nnurse’s and Dunyásha’s protests she went out into the porch; Dron,\nDunyásha, the nurse, and Michael Ivánovich following her.\n“They probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to\nremain here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the\nFrench,” thought Princess Mary. “I will offer them monthly rations and\nhousing at our Moscow estate.

So many different eyes, old and young, were fixed on her, and\nthere were so many different faces, that she could not distinguish any of\nthem and, feeling that she must speak to them all at once, did not know how\nto do it. But again the sense that she represented her father and her brother\ngave her courage, and she boldly began her speech.\n“I am very glad you have come,” she said without raising her eyes, and\nfeeling her heart beating quickly and violently. “Drónushka tells me that the\nwar has ruined you. That is our common misfortune, and I shall grudge\nnothing to help you. I am myself going away because it is dangerous here...\nthe enemy is near... because... I am giving you everything, my friends, and I\nbeg you to take everything, all our grain, so that you may not suffer want!\nAnd if you have been told that I am giving you the grain to keep you here—\nthat is not true. On the contrary, I ask you to go with all your belongings to\nour estate near Moscow, and I promise you I will see to it that there you\nshall want for nothing. You shall be given food and lodging.”\nThe princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.\n“I am not doing this on my own account,” she continued, “I do it in the\nname of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my brother\nand his son.”\nAgain she paused. No one broke the silence.\n“Ours is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that is\nmine is yours,” she concluded, scanning the faces before her.\nAll eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She could\nnot fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or apprehension\nand distrust—but the expression on all the faces was identical.\n“We are all very thankful for your bounty, but it won’t do for us to take\nthe landlord’s grain,” said a voice at the back of the crowd.\n“But why not?” asked the princess.\nNo one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd, found that\nevery eye she met now was immediately dropped.\n“But why don’t you want to take it?” she asked again."}, {"page": 1017, "text": "No one answered.\nThe silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch\nsomeone’s eye.\n“Why don’t you speak?” she inquired of a very old man who stood just in\nfront of her leaning on his stick. “If you think something more is wanted,\ntell me! I will do anything,” said she, catching his eye.\nBut as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:\n“Why should we agree? We don’t want the grain.”\n“Why should we give up everything? We don’t agree. Don’t agree.... We\nare sorry for you, but we’re not willing. Go away yourself, alone...” came\nfrom various sides of the crowd.\nAnd again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression, though\nnow it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude, but of angry\nresolve.\n“But you can’t have understood me,” said Princess Mary with a sad\nsmile. “Why don’t you want to go? I promise to house and feed you, while\nhere the enemy would ruin you....”\nBut her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.\n“We’re not willing. Let them ruin us! We won’t take your grain.

She felt strange and awkward.\n“Oh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your houses\nand go into bondage! I dare say! ‘I’ll give you grain, indeed!’ she says,”\nvoices in the crowd were heard saying.\nWith drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the\nhouse.

She felt that she could not\nunderstand them however much she might think about them. She thought\nonly of one thing, her sorrow, which, after the break caused by cares for the\npresent, seemed already to belong to the past. Now she could remember it\nand weep or pray.\nAfter sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh.\nToward midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full moon\nbegan to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist began to\nrise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.\nPictures of the near past—her father’s illness and last moments—rose\none after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now lingered\nover these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the picture of his\ndeath, which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this\nstill and mystic hour of night.

Never will that\nmoment return for him or for me when he might have said all he longed to\nsay, and not Tíkhon but I might have heard and understood him. Why didn’t\nI enter the room?” she thought. “Perhaps he would then have said to me\nwhat he said the day he died. While talking to Tíkhon he asked about me\ntwice. He wanted to see me, and I was standing close by, outside the door. It\nwas sad and painful for him to talk to Tíkhon who did not understand him. I\nremember how he began speaking to him about Lise as if she were alive—\nhe had forgotten she was dead—and Tíkhon reminded him that she was no\nmore, and he shouted, ‘Fool!’ He was greatly depressed. From behind the\ndoor I heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed,\n‘My God!’ Why didn’t I go in then? What could he have done to me? What\ncould I have lost? And perhaps he would then have been comforted and\nwould have said that word to me.” And Princess Mary uttered aloud the\ncaressing word he had said to her on the day of his death. “Dear-est!” she\nrepeated, and began sobbing, with tears that relieved her soul. She now saw\nhis face before her. And not the face she had known ever since she could\nremember and had always seen at a distance, but the timid, feeble face she\nhad seen for the first time quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details,\nwhen she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said.\n“Dear-est!” she repeated again.\n“What was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking\nnow?” This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer she saw\nhim before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his\ncoffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief. And the horror\nthat had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself that that\nwas not he, but something mysterious and horrible, seized her again. She\ntried to think of something else and to pray, but could do neither.

Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces and\nscanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and singing\nsome incoherent song, and approached the officers.\n“Fine fellows!” said Rostóv laughing. “Is there any hay here?”\n“And how like one another,” said Ilyín.\n“A mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!” sang one of the peasants with a\nblissful smile.\nOne of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rostóv.\n“Who do you belong to?” he asked.\n“The French,” replied Ilyín jestingly, “and here is Napoleon himself”—\nand he pointed to Lavrúshka.\n“Then you are Russians?” the peasant asked again.\n“And is there a large force of you here?” said another, a short man,\ncoming up.\n“Very large,” answered Rostóv. “But why have you collected here?” he\nadded. “Is it a holiday?”\n“The old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,”\nreplied the peasant, moving away.\nAt that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women and\na man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.\n“The one in pink is mine, so keep off!” said Ilyín on seeing Dunyásha\nrunning resolutely toward him.\n“She’ll be ours!” said Lavrúshka to Ilyín, winking.\n“What do you want, my pretty?” said Ilyín with a smile.\n“The princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name.”\n“This is Count Rostóv, squadron commander, and I am your humble\nservant.”\n“Co-o-om-pa-ny!” roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he\nlooked at Ilyín talking to the girl. Following Dunyásha, Alpátych advanced\nto Rostóv, having bared his head while still at a distance.\n“May I make bold to trouble your honor?” said he respectfully, but with a\nshade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand thrust"}, {"page": 1023, "text": "into his bosom. “My mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince Nicholas\nBolkónski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding herself in\ndifficulties owing to the boorishness of these people”—he pointed to the\npeasants—“asks you to come up to the house.... Won’t you, please, ride on a\nlittle farther,” said Alpátych with a melancholy smile, “as it is not\nconvenient in the presence of...?” He pointed to the two peasants who kept\nas close to him as horseflies to a horse.\n“Ah!... Alpátych... Ah, Yákov Alpátych... Grand! Forgive us for Christ’s\nsake, eh?” said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.\nRostóv looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.\n“Or perhaps they amuse your honor?” remarked Alpátych with a staid air,\nas he pointed at the old men with his free hand.\n“No, there’s not much to be amused at here,” said Rostóv, and rode on a\nlittle way. “What’s the matter?” he asked.\n“I make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don’t wish\nto let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her horses, so\nthat though everything has been packed up since morning, her excellency\ncannot get away.”\n“Impossible!” exclaimed Rostóv.\n“I have the honor to report to you the actual truth,” said Alpátych.\nRostóv dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed Alpátych\nto the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. It appeared that the\nprincess’ offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and her talk with\nDron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect that Dron had\nfinally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared\nwhen Alpátych sent for him; and that in the morning when the princess gave\norders to harness for her journey, the peasants had come in a large crowd to\nthe barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village: that\nthere was an order not to move, and that they would unharness the horses.\nAlpátych had gone out to admonish them, but was told (it was chiefly Karp\nwho did the talking, Dron not showing himself in the crowd) that they could\nnot let the princess go, that there was an order to the contrary, but that if she\nstayed they would serve her as before and obey her in everything.\nAt the moment when Rostóv and Ilyín were galloping along the road,\nPrincess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alpátych, her nurse, and the"}, {"page": 1024, "text": "maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the\ncavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran\naway, and the women in the house began to wail.\n“Father! Benefactor! God has sent you!” exclaimed deeply moved voices\nas Rostóv passed through the anteroom.\nPrincess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting\nroom, when Rostóv was shown in. She could not grasp who he was and\nwhy he had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his Russian\nface, and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a\nman of her own class, she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and\nbegan speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion. This\nmeeting immediately struck Rostóv as a romantic event. “A helpless girl\noverwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants! And\nwhat a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there are in\nher features and expression!” thought he as he looked at her and listened to\nher timid story.\nWhen she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her\nfather’s funeral, her voice trembled. She turned away, and then, as if fearing\nhe might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at him with\nan apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in Rostóv’s eyes.\nPrincess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant\nlook which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.\n“I cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride here\nand am able to show my readiness to serve you,” said Rostóv, rising. “Go\nwhen you please, and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare to\ncause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort.” And\nbowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal blood, he moved toward the\ndoor.\nRostóv’s deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would\nconsider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to take\nadvantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.\nPrincess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.\n“I am very, very grateful to you,” she said in French, “but I hope it was\nall a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.” She suddenly\nbegan to cry."}, {"page": 1025, "text": "“Excuse me!” she said.\nRostóv, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow."}, {"page": 1026, "text": "CHAPTER XIV\n“Well, is she pretty? Ah, friend—my pink one is delicious; her name is\nDunyásha....”\nBut on glancing at Rostóv’s face Ilyín stopped short. He saw that his hero\nand commander was following quite a different train of thought.\nRostóv glanced angrily at Ilyín and without replying strode off with rapid\nsteps to the village.\n“I’ll show them; I’ll give it to them, the brigands!” said he to himself.\nAlpátych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up with\nhim with difficulty.\n“What decision have you been pleased to come to?” said he.\nRostóv stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned on\nAlpátych.\n“Decision? What decision? Old dotard!...” cried he. “What have you been\nabout? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can’t manage them? You’re a\ntraitor yourself! I know you. I’ll flay you all alive!...” And as if afraid of\nwasting his store of anger, he left Alpátych and went rapidly forward.\nAlpátych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with Rostóv at a\ngliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said the peasants were\nobdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to\n“overresist” them without an armed force, and would it not be better first to\nsend for the military?\n“I’ll give them armed force... I’ll ‘overresist’ them!” uttered Rostóv\nmeaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent it.\nWithout considering what he would do he moved unconciously with\nquick, resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it the\nmore Alpátych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good"}, {"page": 1027, "text": "results. The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw\nRostóv’s rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.\nAfter the hussars had come to the village and Rostóv had gone to see the\nprincess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd.\nSome of the peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and might\ntake it amiss that the mistress was being detained. Dron was of this opinion,\nbut as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked their ex-Elder.\n“How many years have you been fattening on the commune?” Karp\nshouted at him. “It’s all one to you! You’ll dig up your pot of money and\ntake it away with you.... What does it matter to you whether our homes are\nruined or not?”\n“We’ve been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their homes or\ntake away a single grain, and that’s all about it!” cried another.\n“It was your son’s turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You begrudged\nyour lump of a son,” a little old man suddenly began attacking Dron—“and\nso they took my Vánka to be shaved for a soldier! But we all have to die.”\n“To be sure, we all have to die. I’m not against the commune,” said Dron.\n“That’s it—not against it! You’ve filled your belly....”\nThe two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rostóv, followed by Ilyín,\nLavrúshka, and Alpátych, came up to the crowd, Karp, thrusting his fingers\ninto his belt and smiling a little, walked to the front. Dron on the contrary\nretired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together.\n“Who is your Elder here? Hey?” shouted Rostóv, coming up to the crowd\nwith quick steps.\n“The Elder? What do you want with him?...” asked Karp.\nBut before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off and a\nfierce blow jerked his head to one side.\n“Caps off, traitors!” shouted Rostóv in a wrathful voice. “Where’s the\nElder?” he cried furiously.\n“The Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakhárych, you!” meek and\nflustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come\noff their heads.\n“We don’t riot, we’re following the orders,” declared Karp, and at that\nmoment several voices began speaking together."}, {"page": 1028, "text": "“It’s as the old men have decided—there’s too many of you giving\norders.”\n“Arguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!” cried Rostóv unmeaningly in a\nvoice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. “Bind him, bind him!” he\nshouted, though there was no one to bind him but Lavrúshka and Alpátych.\nLavrúshka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from\nbehind.\n“Shall I call up our men from beyond the hill?” he called out.\nAlpátych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to\ncome and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began\ntaking off their belts.\n“Where’s the Elder?” demanded Rostóv in a loud voice.\nWith a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.\n“Are you the Elder? Bind him, Lavrúshka!” shouted Rostóv, as if that\norder, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.\nAnd in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his own\nbelt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.\n“And you all listen to me!” said Rostóv to the peasants. “Be off to your\nhouses at once, and don’t let one of your voices be heard!”\n“Why, we’ve not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness. It’s all\nnonsense.... I said then that it was not in order,” voices were heard bickering\nwith one another.\n“There! What did I say?” said Alpátych, coming into his own again. “It’s\nwrong, lads!”\n“All our stupidity, Yákov Alpátych,” came the answers, and the crowd\nbegan at once to disperse through the village.\nThe two bound men were led off to the master’s house. The two drunken\npeasants followed them.\n“Aye, when I look at you!...” said one of them to Karp.\n“How can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking of,\nyou fool?” added the other—“A real fool!”\nTwo hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the\nBoguchárovo house.

How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord\nwhere it’ll get rubbed? I don’t like that way of doing things. Let it all be\ndone properly, according to rule.

It’s heavy, lads—solid\nbooks.”\n“Yes, they worked all day and didn’t play!” remarked the tall, round-\nfaced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the dictionaries\nthat were on the top.\nUnwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rostóv did not go back to\nthe house but remained in the village awaiting her departure. When her\ncarriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied her eight\nmiles from Boguchárovo to where the road was occupied by our troops. At\nthe inn at Yankóvo he respectfully took leave of her, for the first time\npermitting himself to kiss her hand.\n“How can you speak so!” he blushingly replied to Princess Mary’s\nexpressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had\noccurred. “Any police officer would have done as much! If we had had only\npeasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,” said he\nwith a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. “I am only happy\nto have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance. Good-by,\nPrincess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet you again\nin happier circumstances. If you don’t want to make me blush, please don’t\nthank me!”\nBut the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked him\nwith the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and tenderness.\nShe could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for.

He\nstopped in the village at the priest’s house in front of which stood the\ncommander in chief’s carriage, and he sat down on the bench at the gate\nawaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now called Kutúzov. From the\nfield beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the\nroar of many voices shouting “Hurrah!” to the new commander in chief.\nTwo orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces\nfrom Prince Andrew, availing themselves of Kutúzov’s absence and of the\nfine weather. A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick\nmustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince Andrew,\ninquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and whether he\nwould soon be back.\nPrince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness’ staff but\nwas himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart orderly,\nwho, with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in chief’s orderly\nspeaks to officers, replied:\n“What? His Serene Highness?

I belong to the\nprovince of Smolénsk.”\n“Ah? You’re Pwince Bolkónski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance!\nI’m Lieutenant Colonel Denísov, better known as ‘Váska,’” said Denísov,\npressing Prince Andrew’s hand and looking into his face with a particularly\nkindly attention. “Yes, I heard,” said he sympathetically, and after a short\npause added: “Yes, it’s Scythian warfare.

So you are Pwince Andwew Bolkónski?” He\nswayed his head. “Vewy pleased, Pwince, to make your acquaintance!” he\nrepeated again, smiling sadly, and he again pressed Prince Andrew’s hand.\nPrince Andrew knew Denísov from what Natásha had told him of her\nfirst suitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those\npainful feelings of which he had not thought lately, but which still found\nplace in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and very serious\nimpressions—such as the retreat from Smolénsk, his visit to Bald Hills, and\nthe recent news of his father’s death—and had experienced so many\nemotions, that for a long time past those memories had not entered his\nmind, and now that they did, they did not act on him with nearly their\nformer strength. For Denísov, too, the memories awakened by the name of\nBolkónski belonged to a distant, romantic past, when after supper and after\nNatásha’s singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing\nwhat he was doing. He smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love\nfor Natásha, and passed at once to what now interested him passionately\nand exclusively. This was a plan of campaign he had devised while serving\nat the outposts during the retreat. He had proposed that plan to Barclay de\nTolly and now wished to propose it to Kutúzov. The plan was based on the\nfact that the French line of operation was too extended, and it proposed that\ninstead of, or concurrently with, action on the front to bar the advance of\nthe French, we should attack their line of communication. He began\nexplaining his plan to Prince Andrew."}, {"page": 1034, "text": "“They can’t hold all that line. It’s impossible. I will undertake to bweak\nthwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line, that’s\ncertain! There’s only one way—guewilla warfare!”\nDenísov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to\nBolkónski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the army,\ngrowing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with music and\nsongs and coming from the field where the review was held. Sounds of\nhoofs and shouts were nearing the village.\n“He’s coming! He’s coming!” shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.\nBolkónski and Denísov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers (a\nguard of honor) was standing, and they saw Kutúzov coming down the\nstreet mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of generals rode\nbehind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and a crowd of officers\nran after and around them shouting, “Hurrah!”\nHis adjutants galloped into the yard before him. Kutúzov was impatiently\nurging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he raised\nhis hand to his white Horse Guard’s cap with a red band and no peak,\nnodding his head continually. When he came up to the guard of honor, a\nfine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations, who were giving him the\nsalute, he looked at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute with\nthe steady gaze of a commander and then turned to the crowd of generals\nand officers surrounding him. Suddenly his face assumed a subtle\nexpression, he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity.\n“And with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by,\nGeneral,” he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and Denísov.\n“Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!” shouted those behind him.\nSince Prince Andrew had last seen him Kutúzov had grown still more\ncorpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and the\nfamiliar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was wearing the\nwhite Horse Guard’s cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over\nhis shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and swayed limply on his brisk\nlittle horse.\n“Whew... whew... whew!” he whistled just audibly as he rode into the\nyard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who\nmeans to rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the stirrup and,"}, {"page": 1035, "text": "lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the effort, raised\nit with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned on his knee, groaned, and slipped\ndown into the arms of the Cossacks and adjutants who stood ready to assist\nhim.\nHe pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes, glanced\nat Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved with his\nwaddling gait to the porch. “Whew... whew... whew!” he whistled, and\nagain glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old men, it was only\nafter some seconds that the impression produced by Prince Andrew’s face\nlinked itself up with Kutúzov’s remembrance of his personality.\n“Ah, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy?\nCome along...” said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the\nporch which creaked under his weight.\nHe unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.\n“And how’s your father?”\n“I received news of his death, yesterday,” replied Prince Andrew\nabruptly.\nKutúzov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took\noff his cap and crossed himself:\n“May the kingdom of Heaven be his! God’s will be done to us all!” He\nsighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. “I loved\nhim and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my heart.”\nHe embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for some\ntime did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw that\nKutúzov’s flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes. He\nsighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself.\n“Come! Come with me, we’ll have a talk,” said he.\nBut at that moment Denísov, no more intimidated by his superiors than\nby the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch, despite\nthe angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him. Kutúzov, his\nhands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly. Denísov, having\ngiven his name, announced that he had to communicate to his Serene\nHighness a matter of great importance for their country’s welfare. Kutúzov\nlooked wearily at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance,\nfolded them across his stomach, repeating the words: “For our country’s"}, {"page": 1036, "text": "welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!” Denísov blushed like a girl (it was\nstrange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous, time-worn face) and\nboldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemy’s lines of\ncommunication between Smolénsk and Vyázma. Denísov came from those\nparts and knew the country well. His plan seemed decidedly a good one,\nespecially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke. Kutúzov\nlooked down at his own legs, occasionally glancing at the door of the\nadjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it. And\nfrom that hut, while Denísov was speaking, a general with a portfolio under\nhis arm really did appear.\n“What?” said Kutúzov, in the midst of Denísov’s explanations, “are you\nready so soon?”\n“Ready, your Serene Highness,” replied the general.\nKutúzov swayed his head, as much as to say: “How is one man to deal\nwith it all?” and again listened to Denísov.\n“I give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,” said Denísov, “that I can\nbweak Napoleon’s line of communication!”\n“What relation are you to Intendant General Kiríl Andréevich Denísov?”\nasked Kutúzov, interrupting him.\n“He is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.”\n“Ah, we were friends,” said Kutúzov cheerfully. “All right, all right,\nfriend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow we’ll have a talk.”\nWith a nod to Denísov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers\nKonovnítsyn had brought him.\n“Would not your Serene Highness like to come inside?” said the general\non duty in a discontented voice, “the plans must be examined and several\npapers have to be signed.”\nAn adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness\nwithin. But Kutúzov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he was\ndisengaged. He made a grimace....\n“No, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. I’ll look at\nthem here,” said he. “Don’t go away,” he added, turning to Prince Andrew,\nwho remained in the porch and listened to the general’s report."}, {"page": 1037, "text": "While this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a\nwoman’s voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door. Several times\non glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome\nwoman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding a dish\nand evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief. Kutúzov’s\nadjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of the priest\nwhose home it was, and that she intended to offer his Serene Highness\nbread and salt. “Her husband has welcomed his Serene Highness with the\ncross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the house.... She’s\nvery pretty,” added the adjutant with a smile. At those words Kutúzov\nlooked round. He was listening to the general’s report—which consisted\nchiefly of a criticism of the position at Tsárevo-Zaymíshche—as he had\nlistened to Denísov, and seven years previously had listened to the\ndiscussion at the Austerlitz council of war. He evidently listened only\nbecause he had ears which, though there was a piece of tow in one of them,\ncould not help hearing; but it was evident that nothing the general could say\nwould surprise or even interest him, that he knew all that would be said\nbeforehand, and heard it all only because he had to, as one has to listen to\nthe chanting of a service of prayer. All that Denísov had said was clever and\nto the point. What the general was saying was even more clever and to the\npoint, but it was evident that Kutúzov despised knowledge and cleverness,\nand knew of something else that would decide the matter—something\nindependent of cleverness and knowledge. Prince Andrew watched the\ncommander in chief’s face attentively, and the only expression he could see\nthere was one of boredom, curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine\nwhispering behind the door, and a desire to observe propriety. It was\nevident that Kutúzov despised cleverness and learning and even the\npatriotic feeling shown by Denísov, but despised them not because of his\nown intellect, feelings, or knowledge—he did not try to display any of these\n—but because of something else. He despised them because of his old age\nand experience of life. The only instruction Kutúzov gave of his own accord\nduring that report referred to looting by the Russian troops. At the end of\nthe report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the\nrecovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by\nthe soldiers, when landowners lodged petitions for compensation.\nAfter hearing the matter, Kutúzov smacked his lips together and shook\nhis head."}, {"page": 1038, "text": "“Into the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all, my dear\nfellow,” said he, “into the fire with all such things! Let them cut the crops\nand burn wood to their hearts’ content. I don’t order it or allow it, but I\ndon’t exact compensation either. One can’t get on without it. ‘When wood\nis chopped the chips will fly.’” He looked at the paper again. “Oh, this\nGerman precision!” he muttered, shaking his head."}, {"page": 1039, "text": "CHAPTER XVI\n“Well, that’s all!” said Kutúzov as he signed the last of the documents,\nand rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he\nmoved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.\nThe priest’s wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she had after all\nnot managed to present at the right moment, though she had so long been\npreparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to Kutúzov.\nHe screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and said:\n“Ah, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!”\nHe took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the\ndish for her. “Well, my dear, and how are we getting on?” he asked, moving\nto the door of the room assigned to him. The priest’s wife smiled, and with\ndimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room. The adjutant came\nout to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with him. Half an hour\nlater Prince Andrew was again called to Kutúzov. He found him reclining in\nan armchair, still in the same unbuttoned overcoat. He had in his hand a\nFrench book which he closed as Prince Andrew entered, marking the place\nwith a knife. Prince Andrew saw by the cover that it was Les Chevaliers du\nCygne by Madame de Genlis.\n“Well, sit down, sit down here. Let’s have a talk,” said Kutúzov. “It’s sad,\nvery sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a father to you, a second\nfather....”\nPrince Andrew told Kutúzov all he knew of his father’s death, and what\nhe had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.\n“What... what they have brought us to!” Kutúzov suddenly cried in an\nagitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince Andrew’s\nstory the condition Russia was in. “But give me time, give me time!” he\nsaid with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue this agitating\nconversation, and added: “I sent for you to keep you with me.”"}, {"page": 1040, "text": "“I thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the staff,”\nreplied Prince Andrew with a smile which Kutúzov noticed.\nKutúzov glanced inquiringly at him.\n“But above all,” added Prince Andrew, “I have grown used to my\nregiment, am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I should\nbe sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being with you,\nbelieve me...”\nA shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up Kutúzov’s podgy\nface. He cut Bolkónski short.\n“I am sorry, for I need you. But you’re right, you’re right! It’s not here\nthat men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men are not. The\nregiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers served there\nas you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I remember, yes, I remember you\nwith the standard!” said Kutúzov, and a flush of pleasure suffused Prince\nAndrew’s face at this recollection.\nTaking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kutúzov offered his cheek\nto be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man’s eyes.\nThough Prince Andrew knew that Kutúzov’s tears came easily, and that he\nwas particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show\nsympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both pleasant\nand flattering to him.\n“Go your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of\nhonor!” He paused. “I missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to\nsend.” And changing the subject, Kutúzov began to speak of the Turkish\nwar and the peace that had been concluded. “Yes, I have been much\nblamed,” he said, “both for that war and the peace... but everything came at\nthe right time. Tout vient à point à celui qui sait attendre. * And there were\nas many advisers there as here...” he went on, returning to the subject of\n“advisers” which evidently occupied him. “Ah, those advisers!” said he. “If\nwe had listened to them all we should not have made peace with Turkey and\nshould not have been through with that war. Everything in haste, but more\nhaste, less speed. Kámenski would have been lost if he had not died. He\nstormed fortresses with thirty thousand men. It is not difficult to capture a\nfortress but it is difficult to win a campaign. For that, not storming and\nattacking but patience and time are wanted. Kámenski sent soldiers to\nRustchuk, but I only employed these two things and took more fortresses"}, {"page": 1041, "text": "than Kámenski and made them Turks eat horseflesh!” He swayed his head.\n“And the French shall too, believe me,” he went on, growing warmer and\nbeating his chest, “I’ll make them eat horseflesh!” And tears again dimmed\nhis eyes.\n* “Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait.”\n“But shan’t we have to accept battle?” remarked Prince Andrew.\n“We shall if everybody wants it; it can’t be helped.... But believe me, my\ndear boy, there is nothing stronger than those two: patience and time, they\nwill do it all. But the advisers n’entendent pas de cette oreille, voilà le mal.\n* Some want a thing—others don’t. What’s one to do?” he asked, evidently\nexpecting an answer. “Well, what do you want us to do?” he repeated and\nhis eye shone with a deep, shrewd look. “I’ll tell you what to do,” he\ncontinued, as Prince Andrew still did not reply: “I will tell you what to do,\nand what I do. Dans le doute, mon cher,” he paused, “abstiens-toi” *(2)—\nhe articulated the French proverb deliberately.\n* “Don’t see it that way, that’s the trouble.”\n* (2) “When in doubt, my dear fellow, do nothing.”\n“Well, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I share\nyour sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a prince, nor\na commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything come straight to\nme. Good-by, my dear boy.”\nAgain he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter had\nleft the room Kutúzov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished\nnovel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.\nPrince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that\ninterview with Kutúzov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the\ngeneral course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted.\nThe more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man—in\nwhom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions, and in place of an\nintellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions) only the capacity\ncalmly to contemplate the course of events—the more reassured he was that\neverything would be as it should. “He will not bring in any plan of his own.\nHe will not devise or undertake anything,” thought Prince Andrew, “but he\nwill hear everything, remember everything, and put everything in its place."}, {"page": 1042, "text": "He will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He\nunderstands that there is something stronger and more important than his\nown will—the inevitable course of events, and he can see them and grasp\ntheir significance, and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling\nand renounce his personal wish directed to something else. And above all,”\nthought Prince Andrew, “one believes in him because he’s Russian, despite\nthe novel by Genlis and the French proverbs, and because his voice shook\nwhen he said: ‘What they have brought us to!’ and had a sob in it when he\nsaid he would ‘make them eat horseflesh!’”\nOn such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and\ngeneral approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the\npopular choice of Kutúzov as commander in chief was received."}, {"page": 1043, "text": "CHAPTER XVII\nAfter the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual\ncourse, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember\nthe recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe that Russia\nwas really in danger and that the members of the English Club were also\nsons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it. The one thing that\nrecalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the Emperor’s\nstay was the call for contributions of men and money, a necessity that as\nsoon as the promises had been made assumed a legal, official form and\nbecame unavoidable.\nWith the enemy’s approach to Moscow, the Moscovites’ view of their\nsituation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more\nfrivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger\napproaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices that\nspeak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a man\nto consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it; the other,\nstill more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and painful to think of\nthe danger, since it is not in man’s power to foresee everything and avert the\ngeneral course of events, and it is therefore better to disregard what is\npainful till it comes, and to think about what is pleasant. In solitude a man\ngenerally listens to the first voice, but in society to the second. So it was\nnow with the inhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people had been as\ngay in Moscow as that year.\nRostopchín’s broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a\npotman, and a Moscow burgher called Karpúshka Chigírin, “who—having\nbeen a militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub—heard that\nNapoleon wished to come to Moscow, grew angry, abused the French in\nvery bad language, came out of the drink shop, and, under the sign of the\neagle, began to address the assembled people,” were read and discussed,\ntogether with the latest of Vasíli Lvóvich Púshkin’s bouts rimés."}, {"page": 1044, "text": "In the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these\nbroadsheets, and some liked the way Karpúshka jeered at the French,\nsaying: “They will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our\nbuckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are all\ndwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork.”\nOthers did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar. It was said\nthat Rostopchín had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners from\nMoscow, and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon among\nthem; but this was told chiefly to introduce Rostopchín’s witty remark on\nthat occasion. The foreigners were deported to Nízhni by boat, and\nRostopchín had said to them in French: “Rentrez en vous-mêmes; entrez\ndans la barque, et n’en faites pas une barque de Charon.” * There was talk\nof all the government offices having been already removed from Moscow,\nand to this Shinshín’s witticism was added—that for that alone Moscow\nought to be grateful to Napoleon. It was said that Mamónov’s regiment\nwould cost him eight hundred thousand rubles, and that Bezúkhov had\nspent even more on his, but that the best thing about Bezúkhov’s action was\nthat he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his\nregiment without charging anything for the show.\n* “Think it over; get into the barque, and take care not to make it a barque of\nCharon.”\n“You don’t spare anyone,” said Julie Drubetskáya as she collected and\npressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed fingers.\nJulie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a farewell\nsoiree.\n“Bezúkhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured. What\npleasure is there to be so caustique?”\n“A forfeit!” cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called\n“mon chevalier,” and who was going with her to Nízhni.\nIn Julie’s set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been agreed that\nthey would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a slip and\nspoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary\nContributions.\n“Another forfeit for a Gallicism,” said a Russian writer who was present.\n“‘What pleasure is there to be’ is not Russian!”"}, {"page": 1045, "text": "“You spare no one,” continued Julie to the young man without heeding\nthe author’s remark.\n“For caustique—I am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay again\nfor the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I won’t be\nresponsible,” she remarked, turning to the author: “I have neither the money\nnor the time, like Prince Galítsyn, to engage a master to teach me Russian!”\n“Ah, here he is!” she added. “Quand on... No, no,” she said to the militia\nofficer, “you won’t catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its rays!” and\nshe smiled amiably at Pierre. “We were just talking of you,” she said with\nthe facility in lying natural to a society woman. “We were saying that your\nregiment would be sure to be better than Mamónov’s.”\n“Oh, don’t talk to me of my regiment,” replied Pierre, kissing his hostess’\nhand and taking a seat beside her. “I am so sick of it.”\n“You will, of course, command it yourself?” said Julie, directing a sly,\nsarcastic glance toward the militia officer.\nThe latter in Pierre’s presence had ceased to be caustic, and his face\nexpressed perplexity as to what Julie’s smile might mean. In spite of his\nabsent-mindedness and good nature, Pierre’s personality immediately\nchecked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.\n“No,” said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. “I should\nmake too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I should hardly\nbe able to climb onto a horse.”\nAmong those whom Julie’s guests happened to choose to gossip about\nwere the Rostóvs.\n“I hear that their affairs are in a very bad way,” said Julie. “And he is so\nunreasonable, the count himself I mean. The Razumóvskis wanted to buy\nhis house and his estate near Moscow, but it drags on and on. He asks too\nmuch.”\n“No, I think the sale will come off in a few days,” said someone.\n“Though it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now.”\n“Why?” asked Julie. “You don’t think Moscow is in danger?”\n“Then why are you leaving?”\n“I? What a question! I am going because... well, because everyone is\ngoing: and besides—I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon.”"}, {"page": 1046, "text": "“Well, of course, of course! Let me have some more strips of linen.”\n“If he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his\ndebts,” said the militia officer, speaking of Rostóv.\n“A kindly old man but not up to much. And why do they stay on so long\nin Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago. Natalie is quite\nwell again now, isn’t she?” Julie asked Pierre with a knowing smile.\n“They are waiting for their younger son,” Pierre replied. “He joined\nObolénski’s Cossacks and went to Bélaya Tsérkov where the regiment is\nbeing formed. But now they have had him transferred to my regiment and\nare expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave long ago, but the\ncountess won’t on any account leave Moscow till her son returns.”\n“I met them the day before yesterday at the Arkhárovs’. Natalie has\nrecovered her looks and is brighter. She sang a song. How easily some\npeople get over everything!”\n“Get over what?” inquired Pierre, looking displeased.\nJulie smiled.\n“You know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de\nSouza’s novels.”\n“What knights? What do you mean?” demanded Pierre, blushing.\n“Oh, come, my dear count! C’est la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous\nadmire, ma parole d’honneur!” *\n* “It is the talk of all Moscow. My word, I admire you!”\n“Forfeit, forfeit!” cried the militia officer.\n“All right, one can’t talk—how tiresome!”\n“What is ‘the talk of all Moscow’?” Pierre asked angrily, rising to his\nfeet.\n“Come now, Count, you know!”\n“I don’t know anything about it,” said Pierre.\n“I know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always more\nfriendly with Véra—that dear Véra.”\n“No, madame!” Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, “I have not\ntaken on myself the role of Natalie Rostóva’s knight at all, and have not"}, {"page": 1047, "text": "been to their house for nearly a month. But I cannot understand the\ncruelty...”\n“Qui s’excuse s’accuse,” * said Julie, smiling and waving the lint\ntriumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the subject.\n“Do you know what I heard today? Poor Mary Bolkónskaya arrived in\nMoscow yesterday. Do you know that she has lost her father?”\n* “Who excuses himself, accuses himself.”\n“Really? Where is she? I should like very much to see her,” said Pierre.\n“I spent the evening with her yesterday. She is going to their estate near\nMoscow either today or tomorrow morning, with her nephew.”\n“Well, and how is she?” asked Pierre.\n“She is well, but sad. But do you know who rescued her? It is quite a\nromance. Nicholas Rostóv! She was surrounded, and they wanted to kill her\nand had wounded some of her people. He rushed in and saved her....”\n“Another romance,” said the militia officer. “Really, this general flight\nhas been arranged to get all the old maids married off. Catiche is one and\nPrincess Bolkónskaya another.”\n“Do you know, I really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune\nhomme.” *\n* “A little bit in love with the young man.”\n“Forfeit, forfeit, forfeit!”\n“But how could one say that in Russian?”"}, {"page": 1048, "text": "CHAPTER XVIII\nWhen Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopchín’s\nbroadsheets that had been brought that day.\nThe first declared that the report that Count Rostopchín had forbidden\npeople to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he was glad that ladies\nand tradesmen’s wives were leaving the city. “There will be less panic and\nless gossip,” ran the broadsheet “but I will stake my life on it that that\nscoundrel will not enter Moscow.” These words showed Pierre clearly for\nthe first time that the French would enter Moscow. The second broadsheet\nstated that our headquarters were at Vyázma, that Count Wittgenstein had\ndefeated the French, but that as many of the inhabitants of Moscow wished\nto be armed, weapons were ready for them at the arsenal: sabers, pistols,\nand muskets which could be had at a low price. The tone of the\nproclamation was not as jocose as in the former Chigírin talks. Pierre\npondered over these broadsheets. Evidently the terrible stormcloud he had\ndesired with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused\ninvoluntary horror in him was drawing near.\n“Shall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?” he asked himself\nfor the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on the table and\nbegan to lay them out for a game of patience.\n“If this patience comes out,” he said to himself after shuffling the cards,\nholding them in his hand, and lifting his head, “if it comes out, it means...\nwhat does it mean?”\nHe had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the\neldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.\n“Then it will mean that I must go to the army,” said Pierre to himself.\n“Come in, come in!” he added to the princess.\nOnly the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long waist, was\nstill living in Pierre’s house. The two younger ones had both married."}, {"page": 1049, "text": "“Excuse my coming to you, cousin,” she said in a reproachful and\nagitated voice. “You know some decision must be come to. What is going to\nhappen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is it\nthat we are staying on?”\n“On the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine,” said Pierre in the\nbantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling\nuncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.\n“Satisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Ivánovna told me today\nhow our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly does them credit!\nAnd the people too are quite mutinous—they no longer obey, even my maid\nhas taken to being rude. At this rate they will soon begin beating us. One\ncan’t walk in the streets. But, above all, the French will be here any day\nnow, so what are we waiting for? I ask just one thing of you, cousin,” she\nwent on, “arrange for me to be taken to Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I\ncan’t live under Bonaparte’s rule.”\n“Oh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On\nthe contrary...”\n“I won’t submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If you\ndon’t want to do this...”\n“But I will, I’ll give the order at once.”\nThe princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry\nwith. Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.\n“But you have been misinformed,” said Pierre. “Everything is quiet in the\ncity and there is not the slightest danger. See! I’ve just been reading...” He\nshowed her the broadsheet. “Count Rostopchín writes that he will stake his\nlife on it that the enemy will not enter Moscow.”\n“Oh, that count of yours!” said the princess malevolently. “He is a\nhypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot. Didn’t he\nwrite in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, ‘whoever it might be, should\nbe dragged to the lockup by his hair’? (How silly!) ‘And honor and glory to\nwhoever captures him,’ he says. This is what his cajolery has brought us to!\nBarbara Ivánovna told me the mob near killed her because she said\nsomething in French.”\n“Oh, but it’s so...

In general\nthe head steward made out to Pierre that his project of raising a regiment\nwould ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely able to repress a smile.\n“Well then, sell it,” said he. “What’s to be done? I can’t draw back now!”\nThe worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the better was\nPierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he expected\nwas approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was left in town. Julie had gone,\nand so had Princess Mary. Of his intimate friends only the Rostóvs\nremained, but he did not go to see them.\nTo distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of Vorontsóvo to\nsee the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe, and a trial\nballoon that was to go up next day. The balloon was not yet ready, but\nPierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperor’s desire. The\nEmperor had written to Count Rostopchín as follows:\nAs soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and\nintelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kutúzov to let him\nknow. I have informed him of the matter.\nPlease impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for\nthe first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy’s\nhands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with those of the\ncommander in chief.\nOn his way home from Vorontsóvo, as he was passing the Bolótnoe Place\nPierre, seeing a large crowd round the Lóbnoe Place, stopped and got out of\nhis trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being flogged. The\nflogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the\nflogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and a green\njacket, who was moaning piteously. Another criminal, thin and pale, stood\nnear. Judging by their faces they were both Frenchmen. With a frightened"}, {"page": 1051, "text": "and suffering look resembling that on the thin Frenchman’s face, Pierre\npushed his way in through the crowd.\n“What is it? Who is it? What is it for?” he kept asking.\nBut the attention of the crowd—officials, burghers, shopkeepers,\npeasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses—was so eagerly centered on\nwhat was passing in Lóbnoe Place that no one answered him. The stout man\nrose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently trying to appear firm\nbegan to pull on his jacket without looking about him, but suddenly his lips\ntrembled and he began to cry, in the way full-blooded grown-up men cry,\nthough angry with himself for doing so. In the crowd people began talking\nloudly, to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to Pierre.\n“He’s cook to some prince.”\n“Eh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets his\nteeth on edge!” said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind Pierre, when\nthe Frenchman began to cry.\nThe clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be\nappreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch in\ndismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.\nPierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went back\nto his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took his seat. As\nthey drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so audibly that\nthe coachman asked him:\n“What is your pleasure?”\n“Where are you going?” shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to\nLubyánka Street.\n“To the Governor’s, as you ordered,” answered the coachman.\n“Fool! Idiot!” shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman—a thing he rarely\ndid. “Home, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!” “I must get away this\nvery day,” he murmured to himself.\nAt the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the\nLóbnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no\nlonger remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it\nseemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the man\nought to have known it for himself."}, {"page": 1052, "text": "On reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evstáfey—his head coachman\nwho knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow—\nthat he would leave that night for the army at Mozháysk, and that his saddle\nhorses should be sent there. This could not all be arranged that day, so on\nEvstáfey’s representation Pierre had to put off his departure till next day to\nallow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance.\nOn the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain, and\nafter dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night in\nPerkhúshkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that evening.\n(This was the battle of Shevárdino.) He was told that there in Perkhúshkovo\nthe earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could answer his questions as\nto who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was approaching Mozháysk.\nEvery house in Mozháysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the hostel\nwhere Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be\nhad. It was full of officers.\nEverywhere in Mozháysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on the\nmarch. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and cannon\nwere everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and the farther\nhe left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the\nmore was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he\nhad not experienced before. It was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the\nSlobóda Palace during the Emperor’s visit—a sense of the necessity of\nundertaking something and sacrificing something. He now experienced a\nglad consciousness that everything that constitutes men’s happiness—the\ncomforts of life, wealth, even life itself—is rubbish it is pleasant to throw\naway, compared with something... With what? Pierre could not say, and he\ndid not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular\ndelight in sacrificing everything. He was not occupied with the question of\nwhat to sacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and\njoyous sensation."}, {"page": 1053, "text": "CHAPTER XIX\nOn the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shevárdino Redoubt was\nfought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side, and on the\ntwenty-sixth the battle of Borodinó itself took place.\nWhy and how were the battles of Shevárdino and Borodinó given and\naccepted? Why was the battle of Borodinó fought? There was not the least\nsense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate result for the\nRussians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer to the\ndestruction of Moscow—which we feared more than anything in the world;\nand for the French its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to\nthe destruction of their whole army—which they feared more than anything\nin the world. What the result must be was quite obvious, and yet Napoleon\noffered and Kutúzov accepted that battle.\nIf the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must\nhave been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles\nand giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army, he was\nadvancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally clear to\nKutúzov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his\narmy he would certainly lose Moscow. For Kutúzov this was\nmathematically clear, as it is that if when playing draughts I have one man\nless and go on exchanging, I shall certainly lose, and therefore should not\nexchange. When my opponent has sixteen men and I have fourteen, I am\nonly one eighth weaker than he, but when I have exchanged thirteen more\nmen he will be three times as strong as I am.\nBefore the battle of Borodinó our strength in proportion to the French\nwas about as five to six, but after that battle it was little more than one to\ntwo: previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty\nthousand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred\nthousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced Kutúzov accepted the battle,\nwhile Napoleon, who was said to be a commander of genius, gave it, losing"}, {"page": 1054, "text": "a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more.\nIf it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying Moscow as\nhe had ended a previous campaign by occupying Vienna, there is much\nevidence to the contrary. Napoleon’s historians themselves tell us that from\nSmolénsk onwards he wished to stop, knew the danger of his extended\nposition, and knew that the occupation of Moscow would not be the end of\nthe campaign, for he had seen at Smolénsk the state in which Russian towns\nwere left to him, and had not received a single reply to his repeated\nannouncements of his wish to negotiate.\nIn giving and accepting battle at Borodinó, Kutúzov acted involuntarily\nand irrationally. But later on, to fit what had occurred, the historians\nprovided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the\ngenerals who, of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and\ninvoluntary.\nThe ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish\nthe whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to accustom ourselves\nto the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are meaningless.\nOn the other question, how the battle of Borodinó and the preceding\nbattle of Shevárdino were fought, there also exists a definite and well-\nknown, but quite false, conception. All the historians describe the affair as\nfollows:\nThe Russian army, they say, in its retreat from Smolénsk sought out for\nitself the best position for a general engagement and found such a position\nat Borodinó.\nThe Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the left of the\nhighroad (from Moscow to Smolénsk) and almost at a right angle to it, from\nBorodinó to Utítsa, at the very place where the battle was fought.\nIn front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set up on the\nShevárdino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth, we are told,\nNapoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the twenty-sixth,\nattacked the whole Russian army, which was in position on the field of\nBorodinó.\nSo the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares to look\ninto the matter can easily convince himself."}, {"page": 1055, "text": "The Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the contrary,\nduring the retreat passed many positions better than Borodinó. They did not\nstop at any one of these positions because Kutúzov did not wish to occupy a\nposition he had not himself chosen, because the popular demand for a battle\nhad not yet expressed itself strongly enough, and because Milorádovich had\nnot yet arrived with the militia, and for many other reasons. The fact is that\nother positions they had passed were stronger, and that the position at\nBorodinó (the one where the battle was fought), far from being strong, was\nno more a position than any other spot one might find in the Russian\nEmpire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard.\nNot only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of Borodinó\nto the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that is, the position on\nwhich the battle took place), but never till the twenty-fifth of August, 1812,\ndid they think that a battle might be fought there. This was shown first by\nthe fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that\nthose begun on the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and\nsecondly, by the position of the Shevárdino Redoubt. That redoubt was\nquite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why\nwas it more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts\nexhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on\nthe twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the\nenemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position on which the battle was fought\nhad not been foreseen and that the Shevárdino Redoubt was not an\nadvanced post of that position, we have the fact that up to the twenty-fifth,\nBarclay de Tolly and Bagratión were convinced that the Shevárdino\nRedoubt was the left flank of the position, and that Kutúzov himself in his\nreport, written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of the Shevárdino\nRedoubt as the left flank of the position. It was much later, when reports on\nthe battle of Borodinó were written at leisure, that the incorrect and\nextraordinary statement was invented (probably to justify the mistakes of a\ncommander in chief who had to be represented as infallible) that the\nShevárdino Redoubt was an advanced post—whereas in reality it was\nsimply a fortified point on the left flank—and that the battle of Borodinó\nwas fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected, whereas it\nwas fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched.\nThe case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river\nKolochá—which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute"}, {"page": 1056, "text": "angle—so that the left flank was at Shevárdino, the right flank near the\nvillage of Nóvoe, and the center at Borodinó at the confluence of the rivers\nKolochá and Vóyna.\nTo anyone who looks at the field of Borodinó without thinking of how\nthe battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the river Kolochá,\npresents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an\nenemy from advancing along the Smolénsk road to Moscow.\nNapoleon, riding to Valúevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as the\nhistory books say he did) the position of the Russians from Utítsa to\nBorodinó (he could not have seen that position because it did not exist), nor\ndid he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while pursuing the\nRussian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the Russian position—at\nthe Shevárdino Redoubt—and unexpectedly for the Russians moved his\narmy across the Kolochá. And the Russians, not having time to begin a\ngeneral engagement, withdrew their left wing from the position they had\nintended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen\nand was not fortified. By crossing to the other side of the Kolochá to the left\nof the highroad, Napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right\nto left (looking from the Russian side) and transferred it to the plain\nbetween Utítsa, Semënovsk, and Borodinó—a plain no more advantageous\nas a position than any other plain in Russia—and there the whole battle of\nthe twenty-sixth of August took place.\nHad Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the\nKolochá, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt\nbut had begun the attack next morning, no one would have doubted that the\nShevárdino Redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the battle would\nhave taken place where we expected it. In that case we should probably\nhave defended the Shevárdino Redoubt—our left flank—still more\nobstinately. We should have attacked Napoleon in the center or on the right,\nand the engagement would have taken place on the twenty-fifth, in the\nposition we intended and had fortified. But as the attack on our left flank\ntook place in the evening after the retreat of our rear guard (that is,\nimmediately after the fight at Gridnëva), and as the Russian commanders\ndid not wish, or were not in time, to begin a general engagement then on the\nevening of the twenty-fourth, the first and chief action of the battle of"}, {"page": 1057, "text": "Borodinó was already lost on the twenty-fourth, and obviously led to the\nloss of the one fought on the twenty-sixth.\nAfter the loss of the Shevárdino Redoubt, we found ourselves on the\nmorning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank, and were\nforced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be.\nNot only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak,\nunfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was\nincreased by the fact that the Russian commanders—not having fully\nrealized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left\nflank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right\nto left—maintained their extended position from the village of Nóvoe to\nUtítsa, and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during\nthe battle. So it happened that throughout the whole battle the Russians\nopposed the entire French army launched against our left flank with but half\nas many men. (Poniatowski’s action against Utítsa, and Uvárov’s on the\nright flank against the French, were actions distinct from the main course of\nthe battle.) So the battle of Borodinó did not take place at all as (in an effort\nto conceal our commanders’ mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the\nglory due to the Russian army and people) it has been described. The battle\nof Borodinó was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with\nforces only slightly weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the\nloss of the Shevárdino Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodinó\non an open and almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as\nnumerous as the French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not\nmerely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result, but\nunthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight."}, {"page": 1058, "text": "CHAPTER XX\nOn the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozháysk. At the\ndescent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the\ntown past the cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and the\nbells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot.\nBehind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its\nsingers. Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who had\nbeen wounded in the engagement the day before. The peasant drivers,\nshouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The carts,\nin each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting, jolted\nover the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it\nsomething like a road. The wounded, bandaged with rags, with pale cheeks,\ncompressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to the sides of the carts as they\nwere jolted against one another. Almost all of them stared with naïve,\nchildlike curiosity at Pierre’s white hat and green swallow-tail coat.\nPierre’s coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to\none side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the hill with its\nsingers, surrounded Pierre’s carriage and blocked the road. Pierre stopped,\nbeing pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road ran. The\nsunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting and there it\nwas cold and damp, but above Pierre’s head was the bright August sunshine\nand the bells sounded merrily. One of the carts with wounded stopped by\nthe side of the road close to Pierre. The driver in his bast shoes ran panting\nup to it, placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels, and began\narranging the breech-band on his little horse.\nOne of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was\nfollowing the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned\nto look at Pierre.\n“I say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us on to\nMoscow?” he asked."}, {"page": 1059, "text": "Pierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question. He was\nlooking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded,\nnow at the cart by which he was standing, in which two wounded men were\nsitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in the cart had probably\nbeen wounded in the cheek. His whole head was wrapped in rags and one\ncheek was swollen to the size of a baby’s head. His nose and mouth were\ntwisted to one side. This soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing\nhimself. Another, a young lad, a fair-haired recruit as white as though there\nwas no blood in his thin face, looked at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile.\nThe third lay prone so that his face was not visible. The cavalry singers\nwere passing close by:\nAh lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,\nLiving in a foreign land...\nthey sang their soldiers’ dance song.\nAs if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the\nmetallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of the\nsun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of merriment.\nBut beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded near the panting little\nnag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber, and sad.\nThe soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry singers.\n“Oh, the coxcombs!” he muttered reproachfully.\n“It’s not the soldiers only, but I’ve seen peasants today, too.... The\npeasants—even they have to go,” said the soldier behind the cart,\naddressing Pierre with a sad smile. “No distinctions made nowadays....\nThey want the whole nation to fall on them—in a word, it’s Moscow!

This was one of the head army doctors. He was"}, {"page": 1060, "text": "driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young surgeon, and\non recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the driver’s seat to\npull up.\n“Count! Your excellency, how come you to be here?” asked the doctor.\n“Well, you know, I wanted to see...”\n“Yes, yes, there will be something to see....”\nPierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of taking\npart in a battle.\nThe doctor advised him to apply direct to Kutúzov.\n“Why should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?”\nhe said, exchanging glances with his young companion. “Anyhow his\nSerene Highness knows you and will receive you graciously. That’s what\nyou must do.”\nThe doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.\n“You think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is\nexactly?” said Pierre.\n“The position?” repeated the doctor. “Well, that’s not my line. Drive past\nTatárinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the hillock and you’ll\nsee.”\n“Can one see from there?... If you would...”\nBut the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.\n“I would go with you but on my honor I’m up to here”—and he pointed\nto his throat. “I’m galloping to the commander of the corps.

Out of an army of\na hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded, and\nwe haven’t stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or doctors enough for six\nthousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we need other things as well—\nwe must manage as best we can!”\nThe strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who\nhad stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had\nnoticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death\namazed Pierre.\n“They may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death?”\nAnd by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the Mozháysk hill,"}, {"page": 1061, "text": "the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the sun,\nand the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind.\n“The cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a\nmoment think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded.\nYet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they\nwonder at my hat!

The commander in chief was\nputting up there, but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and hardly any\nof the staff were there—they had gone to the church service. Pierre drove\non toward Górki.\nWhen he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street, he saw\nfor the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with crosses on\ntheir caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated and perspiring, were\nat work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the right of the road.\nSome of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth\nalong planks, while others stood about doing nothing.\nTwo officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On seeing\nthese peasants, who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their\nposition as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the wounded men at\nMozháysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said: “They\nwant the whole nation to fall on them.” The sight of these bearded peasants\nat work on the battlefield, with their queer, clumsy boots and perspiring\nnecks, and their shirts opening from the left toward the middle, unfastened,\nexposing their sunburned collarbones, impressed Pierre more strongly with\nthe solemnity and importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen\nor heard."}, {"page": 1062, "text": "CHAPTER XXI\nPierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling militiamen,\nascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor, the battlefield could\nbe seen.\nIt was about eleven o’clock. The sun shone somewhat to the left and\nbehind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising like an\namphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere.\nFrom above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the Smolénsk\nhighroad, passing through a village with a white church some five hundred\npaces in front of the knoll and below it. This was Borodinó. Below the\nvillage the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding down and up,\nrose higher and higher to the village of Valúevo visible about four miles\naway, where Napoleon was then stationed. Beyond Valúevo the road\ndisappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon. Far in the distance in\nthat birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the cross and belfry of the\nKolochá Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here and there over the whole of\nthat blue expanse, to right and left of the forest and the road, smoking\ncampfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops—ours and the\nenemy’s. The ground to the right—along the course of the Kolochá and\nMoskvá rivers—was broken and hilly. Between the hollows the villages of\nBezúbova and Zakhárino showed in the distance. On the left the ground was\nmore level; there were fields of grain, and the smoking ruins of Semënovsk,\nwhich had been burned down, could be seen.\nAll that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the right side\nof the field fully satisfied his expectations. Nowhere could he see the\nbattlefield he had expected to find, but only fields, meadows, troops,\nwoods, the smoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and streams; and try as\nhe would he could descry no military “position” in this place which teemed\nwith life, nor could he even distinguish our troops from the enemy’s."}, {"page": 1063, "text": "“I must ask someone who knows,” he thought, and addressed an officer\nwho was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.\n“May I ask you,” said Pierre, “what village that is in front?”\n“Búrdino, isn’t it?” said the officer, turning to his companion.\n“Borodinó,” the other corrected him.\nThe officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up to\nPierre.\n“Are those our men there?” Pierre inquired.\n“Yes, and there, further on, are the French,” said the officer. “There they\nare, there... you can see them.”\n“Where? Where?” asked Pierre.\n“One can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!”\nThe officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left beyond\nthe river, and the same stern and serious expression that Pierre had noticed\non many of the faces he had met came into his face.\n“Ah, those are the French! And over there?...” Pierre pointed to a knoll\non the left, near which some troops could be seen.\n“Those are ours.”\n“Ah, ours! And there?...” Pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance\nwith a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow where also some\ncampfires were smoking and something black was visible.\n“That’s his again,” said the officer. (It was the Shevárdino Redoubt.) “It\nwas ours yesterday, but now it is his.”\n“Then how about our position?”\n“Our position?” replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. “I can tell\nyou quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our entrenchments. There,\nyou see? There’s our center, at Borodinó, just there,” and he pointed to the\nvillage in front of them with the white church. “That’s where one crosses\nthe Kolochá.

The hot rays of the sun\nbeat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with the hair of the bared\nheads and with the ribbons decorating the icon.

Borís Drubetskóy, brushing his knees with his hand\n(he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the icon), came\nup to him smiling. Borís was elegantly dressed, with a slightly martial touch\nappropriate to a campaign. He wore a long coat and like Kutúzov had a\nwhip slung across his shoulder.\nMeanwhile Kutúzov had reached the village and seated himself in the\nshade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run to fetch\nand another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and brilliant suite\nsurrounded him.\nThe icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre stopped\nsome thirty paces from Kutúzov, talking to Borís.\nHe explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the position.\n“This is what you must do,” said Borís. “I will do the honors of the camp\nto you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen will be. I\nam in attendance on him, you know; I’ll mention it to him. But if you want\nto ride round the position, come along with us. We are just going to the left\nflank. Then when we get back, do spend the night with me and we’ll\narrange a game of cards. Of course you know Dmítri Sergéevich? Those are\nhis quarters,” and he pointed to the third house in the village of Górki.\n“But I should like to see the right flank. They say it’s very strong,” said\nPierre. “I should like to start from the Moskvá River and ride round the\nwhole position.”\n“Well, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left flank.”\n“Yes, yes. But where is Prince Bolkónski’s regiment? Can you point it\nout to me?”"}, {"page": 1068, "text": "“Prince Andrew’s? We shall pass it and I’ll take you to him.”\n“What about the left flank?” asked Pierre\n“To tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state our\nleft flank is in,” said Borís confidentially lowering his voice. “It is not at all\nwhat Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify that knoll quite\ndifferently, but...” Borís shrugged his shoulders, “his Serene Highness\nwould not have it, or someone persuaded him. You see...” but Borís did not\nfinish, for at that moment Kaysárov, Kutúzov’s adjutant, came up to Pierre.\n“Ah, Kaysárov!” said Borís, addressing him with an unembarrassed smile,\n“I was just trying to explain our position to the count. It is amazing how his\nSerene Highness could so foresee the intentions of the French!”\n“You mean the left flank?” asked Kaysárov.\n“Yes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.”\nThough Kutúzov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff, Borís\nhad contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He had\nestablished himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom Borís had\nbeen in attendance, considered young Prince Drubetskóy an invaluable\nman.\nIn the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: Kutúzov’s\nparty and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Borís belonged to the latter\nand no one else, while showing servile respect to Kutúzov, could so create\nan impression that the old fellow was not much good and that Bennigsen\nmanaged everything. Now the decisive moment of battle had come when\nKutúzov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even if\nKutúzov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by\nBennigsen. In any case many great rewards would have to be given for\ntomorrow’s action, and new men would come to the front. So Borís was full\nof nervous vivacity all day.\nAfter Kaysárov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had\nnot time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered\nupon him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all expressed\nanimation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of the\nexcitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of\npersonal success; his mind, however, was occupied by the different\nexpression he saw on other faces—an expression that spoke not of personal"}, {"page": 1069, "text": "matters but of the universal questions of life and death. Kutúzov noticed\nPierre’s figure and the group gathered round him.\n“Call him to me,” said Kutúzov.\nAn adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness’ wish, and Pierre went\ntoward Kutúzov’s bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It was\nDólokhov.\n“How did that fellow get here?” asked Pierre.\n“He’s a creature that wriggles in anywhere!” was the answer. “He has\nbeen degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He’s been\nproposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy’s picket\nline at night.... He’s a brave fellow.”\nPierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kutúzov.\n“I concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send\nme away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I shouldn’t\nlose anything...” Dólokhov was saying.\n“Yes, yes.”\n“But if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland for\nwhich I am ready to die.”\n“Yes, yes.”\n“And should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his\nskin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene\nHighness.”\n“Yes... Yes...” Kutúzov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more and\nmore as he looked at Pierre.\nJust then Borís, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to Pierre’s\nside near Kutúzov and in a most natural manner, without raising his voice,\nsaid to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted conversation:\n“The militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What\nheroism, Count!”\nBorís evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his Serene\nHighness. He knew Kutúzov’s attention would be caught by those words,\nand so it was.\n“What are you saying about the militia?” he asked Borís."}, {"page": 1070, "text": "“Preparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness—for death—they have\nput on clean shirts.”\n“Ah... a wonderful, a matchless people!” said Kutúzov; and he closed his\neyes and swayed his head. “A matchless people!” he repeated with a sigh.\n“So you want to smell gunpowder?” he said to Pierre. “Yes, it’s a\npleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of your wife’s adorers. Is she\nwell? My quarters are at your service.”\nAnd as often happens with old people, Kutúzov began looking about\nabsent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.\nThen, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew\nKaysárov, his adjutant’s brother.\n“Those verses... those verses of Márin’s... how do they go, eh? Those he\nwrote about Gerákov: ‘Lectures for the corps inditing’... Recite them, recite\nthem!” said he, evidently preparing to laugh.\nKaysárov recited.... Kutúzov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of\nthe verses.\nWhen Pierre had left Kutúzov, Dólokhov came up to him and took his\nhand.\n“I am very glad to meet you here, Count,” he said aloud, regardless of the\npresence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone. “On\nthe eve of a day when God alone knows who of us is fated to survive, I am\nglad of this opportunity to tell you that I regret the misunderstandings that\noccurred between us and should wish you not to have any ill feeling for me.\nI beg you to forgive me.”\nPierre looked at Dólokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to him.\nWith tears in his eyes Dólokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.\nBorís said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to\nPierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.\n“It will interest you,” said he.\n“Yes, very much,” replied Pierre.\nHalf an hour later Kutúzov left for Tatárinova, and Bennigsen and his\nsuite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the line."}, {"page": 1071, "text": "CHAPTER XXIII\nFrom Górki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which,\nwhen they had looked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed out as being\nthe center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay lay by\nthe riverside. They rode across that bridge into the village of Borodinó and\nthence turned to the left, passing an enormous number of troops and guns,\nand came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging. This was the\nredoubt, as yet unnamed, which afterwards became known as the Raévski\nRedoubt, or the Knoll Battery, but Pierre paid no special attention to it. He\ndid not know that it would become more memorable to him than any other\nspot on the plain of Borodinó.\nThey then crossed the hollow to Semënovsk, where the soldiers were\ndragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode\ndownhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by hail,\nfollowing a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of the\nplowed land, and reached some flèches * which were still being dug.\n* A kind of entrenchment.\nAt the flèches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shevárdino\nRedoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several\nhorsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon or Murat\nwas there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of horsemen. Pierre\nalso looked at them, trying to guess which of the scarcely discernible\nfigures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men rode away from the\nmound and disappeared.\nBennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began explaining\nthe whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him, straining each\nfaculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but was\nmortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the task. He"}, {"page": 1072, "text": "could make nothing of it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and, noticing that\nPierre was listening, suddenly said to him:\n“I don’t think this interests you?”\n“On the contrary it’s very interesting!” replied Pierre not quite truthfully.\nFrom the flèches they rode still farther to the left, along a road winding\nthrough a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of the wood a\nbrown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the tramp of the many\nhorses, grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front of them for\nsome time, arousing general attention and laughter, and only when several\nvoices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket. After\ngoing through the wood for about a mile and a half they came out on a\nglade where troops of Túchkov’s corps were stationed to defend the left\nflank.\nHere, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and with\nmuch heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great military\nimportance. In front of Túchkov’s troops was some high ground not\noccupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake, saying that it\nwas madness to leave a height which commanded the country around\nunoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the generals expressed the\nsame opinion. One in particular declared with martial heat that they were\nput there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen on his own authority ordered the\ntroops to occupy the high ground. This disposition on the left flank\nincreased Pierre’s doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters.\nListening to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the\ntroops behind the hill, he quite understood them and shared their opinion,\nbut for that very reason he could not understand how the man who put them\nthere behind the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder.\nPierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen supposed,\nput there to defend the position, but were in a concealed position as an\nambush, that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an\napproaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not know this and moved\nthe troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the\nmatter to the commander in chief."}, {"page": 1073, "text": "CHAPTER XXIV\nOn that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on his\nelbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazkóvo at the further end\nof his regiment’s encampment. Through a gap in the broken wall he could\nsee, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty-year-old birches with their\nlower branches lopped off, a field on which shocks of oats were standing,\nand some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfires—the soldiers’\nkitchens.\nNarrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to\nhim, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as he had\ndone seven years before at Austerlitz.\nHe had received and given the orders for next day’s battle and had\nnothing more to do. But his thoughts—the simplest, clearest, and therefore\nmost terrible thoughts—would give him no peace. He knew that tomorrow’s\nbattle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part in, and for the first\ntime in his life the possibility of death presented itself to him—not in\nrelation to any worldly matter or with reference to its effect on others, but\nsimply in relation to himself, to his own soul—vividly, plainly, terribly, and\nalmost as a certainty. And from the height of this perception all that had\npreviously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a\ncold white light without shadows, without perspective, without distinction\nof outline. All life appeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he\nhad long been gazing by artificial light through a glass. Now he suddenly\nsaw those badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass. “Yes,\nyes! There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured, and\ntormented me,” said he to himself, passing in review the principal pictures\nof the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold white\ndaylight of his clear perception of death. “There they are, those rudely\npainted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious. Glory, the good\nof society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itself—how important these"}, {"page": 1074, "text": "pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they seemed to be\nfilled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the cold white light of this\nmorning which I feel is dawning for me.” The three great sorrows of his life\nheld his attention in particular: his love for a woman, his father’s death, and\nthe French invasion which had overrun half Russia. “Love... that little girl\nwho seemed to me brimming over with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved\nher. I made romantic plans of love and happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I\nwas!” he said aloud bitterly. “Ah me! I believed in some ideal love which\nwas to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my absence! Like the\ngentle dove in the fable she was to pine apart from me.... But it was much\nsimpler really.... It was all very simple and horrible.”\n“When my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his land,\nhis air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside, unconscious\nof his existence, as he might brush a chip from his path, and his Bald Hills\nand his whole life fell to pieces. Princess Mary says it is a trial sent from\nabove. What is the trial for, when he is not here and will never return? He is\nnot here! For whom then is the trial intended? The Fatherland, the\ndestruction of Moscow! And tomorrow I shall be killed, perhaps not even\nby a Frenchman but by one of our own men, by a soldier discharging a\nmusket close to my ear as one of them did yesterday, and the French will\ncome and take me by head and heels and fling me into a hole that I may not\nstink under their noses, and new conditions of life will arise, which will\nseem quite ordinary to others and about which I shall know nothing. I shall\nnot exist....”\nHe looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their\nmotionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. “To die... to be killed\ntomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this should still be, but no\nme....”\nAnd the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the smoke of\nthe campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed terrible and\nmenacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose quickly, went out of\nthe shed, and began to walk about.\nAfter he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. “Who’s that?”\nhe cried.\nThe red-nosed Captain Timókhin, formerly Dólokhov’s squadron\ncommander, but now from lack of officers a battalion commander, shyly"}, {"page": 1075, "text": "entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster.\nPrince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come about,\ngave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss them when\nhe heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.\n“Devil take it!” said the voice of a man stumbling over something.\nPrince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped\nover a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It was\nunpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in general, and\nPierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful moments of his last\nvisit to Moscow.\n“You? What a surprise!” said he. “What brings you here? This is\nunexpected!”\nAs he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness—they\nexpressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached the\nshed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrew’s face he felt\nconstrained and ill at ease.\n“I have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me,” said Pierre,\nwho had so often that day senselessly repeated that word “interesting.” “I\nwish to see the battle.”\n“Oh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would\nthey stop it?” said Prince Andrew sarcastically. “Well, and how’s Moscow?\nAnd my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?” he asked seriously.\n“Yes, they have. Julie Drubetskáya told me so. I went to see them, but\nmissed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow.”"}, {"page": 1076, "text": "CHAPTER XXV\nThe officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently\nreluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have tea.\nSeats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with surprise\nat Pierre’s huge stout figure and listened to his talk of Moscow and the\nposition of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince Andrew remained\nsilent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre addressed his\nremarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.\n“So you understand the whole position of our troops?” Prince Andrew\ninterrupted him.\n“Yes—that is, how do you mean?” said Pierre. “Not being a military man\nI can’t say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general position.”\n“Well, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,” said\nPrince Andrew.\n“Oh!” said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince\nAndrew. “Well, and what do you think of Kutúzov’s appointment?” he\nasked.\n“I was very glad of his appointment, that’s all I know,” replied Prince\nAndrew.\n“And tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are\nsaying heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?”\n“Ask them,” replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.\nPierre looked at Timókhin with the condescendingly interrogative smile\nwith which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.\n“We see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your\nexcellency,” said Timókhin timidly, and continually turning to glance at his\ncolonel.\n“Why so?” asked Pierre."}, {"page": 1077, "text": "“Well, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why,\nwhen we were retreating from Sventsyáni we dare not touch a stick or a\nwisp of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get it\nall; wasn’t it so, your excellency?” and again Timókhin turned to the prince.\n“But we daren’t. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for that\nkind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became\nstraightforward. Now we see light....”\n“Then why was it forbidden?”\nTimókhin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer\nsuch a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.\n“Why, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the\nenemy,” said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. “It is very sound: one\ncan’t permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding.\nAt Smolénsk too he judged correctly that the French might outflank us, as\nthey had larger forces. But he could not understand this,” cried Prince\nAndrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily: “he could\nnot understand that there, for the first time, we were fighting for Russian\nsoil, and that there was a spirit in the men such as I had never seen before,\nthat we had held the French for two days, and that that success had\nincreased our strength tenfold. He ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts\nand losses went for nothing. He had no thought of betraying us, he tried to\ndo the best he could, he thought out everything, and that is why he is\nunsuitable. He is unsuitable now, just because he plans out everything very\nthoroughly and accurately as every German has to. How can I explain?...\nWell, say your father has a German valet, and he is a splendid valet and\nsatisfies your father’s requirements better than you could, then it’s all right\nto let him serve. But if your father is mortally sick you’ll send the valet\naway and attend to your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands,\nand will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could. So it\nhas been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could serve her\nand be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of\nher own kin. But in your Club they have been making him out a traitor!\nThey slander him as a traitor, and the only result will be that afterwards,\nashamed of their false accusations, they will make him out a hero or a\ngenius instead of a traitor, and that will be still more unjust. He is an honest\nand very punctilious German.”"}, {"page": 1078, "text": "“And they say he’s a skillful commander,” rejoined Pierre.\n“I don’t understand what is meant by ‘a skillful commander,’” replied\nPrince Andrew ironically.\n“A skillful commander?” replied Pierre. “Why, one who foresees all\ncontingencies... and foresees the adversary’s intentions.”\n“But that’s impossible,” said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter settled\nlong ago.\nPierre looked at him in surprise.\n“And yet they say that war is like a game of chess?” he remarked.\n“Yes,” replied Prince Andrew, “but with this little difference, that in chess\nyou may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for\ntime, and with this difference too, that a knight is always stronger than a\npawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while in war a battalion\nis sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a\ncompany. The relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to\nanyone. Believe me,” he went on, “if things depended on arrangements\nmade by the staff, I should be there making arrangements, but instead of\nthat I have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen,\nand I consider that on us tomorrow’s battle will depend and not on those\nothers.... Success never depends, and never will depend, on position, or\nequipment, or even on numbers, and least of all on position.”\n“But on what then?”\n“On the feeling that is in me and in him,” he pointed to Timókhin, “and\nin each soldier.”\nPrince Andrew glanced at Timókhin, who looked at his commander in\nalarm and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity Prince\nAndrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from\nexpressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.\n“A battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose\nthe battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours, but\nvery early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle, and we did\nlose it. And we said so because we had nothing to fight for there, we wanted\nto get away from the battlefield as soon as we could. ‘We’ve lost, so let us\nrun,’ and we ran. If we had not said that till the evening, heaven knows what\nmight not have happened. But tomorrow we shan’t say it! You talk about"}, {"page": 1079, "text": "our position, the left flank weak and the right flank too extended,” he went\non. “That’s all nonsense, there’s nothing of the kind. But what awaits us\ntomorrow? A hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided\non the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run, and that\nthis man or that man is killed, but all that is being done at present is only\nplay. The fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the\nposition not only do not help matters, but hinder. They are only concerned\nwith their own petty interests.”\n“At such a moment?” said Pierre reproachfully.\n“At such a moment!” Prince Andrew repeated. “To them it is only a\nmoment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra\ncross or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred\nthousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight, and\nthe thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side that\nfights more fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you like I will\ntell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the top may\nmake, we shall win tomorrow’s battle. Tomorrow, happen what may, we\nshall win!”\n“There now, your excellency! That’s the truth, the real truth,” said\nTimókhin. “Who would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion,\nbelieve me, wouldn’t drink their vodka! ‘It’s not the day for that!’ they say.”\nAll were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the shed\nwith them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had gone Pierre\napproached Prince Andrew and was about to start a conversation when they\nheard the clatter of three horses’ hoofs on the road not far from the shed,\nand looking in that direction Prince Andrew recognized Wolzogen and\nClausewitz accompanied by a Cossack. They rode close by continuing to\nconverse, and Prince Andrew involuntarily heard these words:\n“Der Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht\ngenug Preis geben,” * said one of them.\n* “The war must be extended widely. I cannot sufficiently commend that view.”\n“Oh, ja,” said the other, “der Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schwächen, so\nkann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung\nnehmen.”*"}, {"page": 1080, "text": "* “Oh, yes, the only aim is to weaken the enemy, so of course one cannot take\ninto account the loss of private individuals.”\n“Oh, no,” agreed the other.\n“Extend widely!” said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they had\nridden past. “In that ‘extend’ were my father, son, and sister, at Bald Hills.\nThat’s all the same to him! That’s what I was saying to you—those German\ngentlemen won’t win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess\nthey can, because they have nothing in their German heads but theories not\nworth an empty eggshell and haven’t in their hearts the one thing needed\ntomorrow—that which Timókhin has. They have yielded up all Europe to\nhim, and have now come to teach us. Fine teachers!” and again his voice\ngrew shrill.\n“So you think we shall win tomorrow’s battle?” asked Pierre.\n“Yes, yes,” answered Prince Andrew absently. “One thing I would do if I\nhad the power,” he began again, “I would not take prisoners. Why take\nprisoners? It’s chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on\ntheir way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me\nevery moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are all criminals.\nAnd so thinks Timókhin and the whole army. They should be executed!\nSince they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been\nsaid at Tilsit.”\n“Yes, yes,” muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrew.\n“I quite agree with you!”\nThe question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozháysk hill and all that\nday now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He now\nunderstood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the\nimpending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and stern\nexpressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up for him by a\nnew light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in physics) of\npatriotism which was present in all these men he had seen, and this\nexplained to him why they all prepared for death calmly, and as it were\nlightheartedly.\n“Not take prisoners,” Prince Andrew continued: “That by itself would\nquite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have played\nat war—that’s what’s vile! We play at magnanimity and all that stuff. Such\nmagnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a"}, {"page": 1081, "text": "lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she is so kindhearted that\nshe can’t look at blood, but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce.\nThey talk to us of the rules of war, of chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to\nthe unfortunate and so on.

They plunder other\npeople’s houses, issue false paper money, and worst of all they kill my\nchildren and my father, and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to\nfoes! Take no prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who has come to this as I\nhave through the same sufferings...”\nPrince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or\nnot Moscow was taken as Smolénsk had been, was suddenly checked in his\nspeech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a few\ntimes in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he\nbegan speaking.\n“If there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only\nwhen it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would\nnot be war because Paul Ivánovich had offended Michael Ivánovich. And\nwhen there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the\ndetermination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these\nWestphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow\nhim into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia\nwithout knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in\nlife; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to\naccept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid\nof falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the\nfavorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military calling is the most\nhighly honored.\n“But what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the\nhabits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war are\nspying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country’s\ninhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud and\nfalsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class are the\nabsence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty,\ndebauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the highest class,\nrespected by everyone. All the kings, except the Chinese, wear military\nuniforms, and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards."}, {"page": 1082, "text": "“They meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill\nand maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for having\nkilled so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they\nannounce a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed the\ngreater their achievement. How does God above look at them and hear\nthem?” exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill, piercing voice. “Ah, my friend,\nit has of late become hard for me to live.

Before a battle one must have one’s sleep out,” repeated Prince\nAndrew.\nHe came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. “Good-by,\nbe off!” he shouted. “Whether we meet again or not...” and turning away\nhurriedly he entered the shed.\nIt was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the\nexpression of Prince Andrew’s face was angry or tender.\nFor some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow\nhim or go away. “No, he does not want it!” Pierre concluded. “And I know\nthat this is our last meeting!” He sighed deeply and rode back to Górki.\nOn re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he could\nnot sleep.\nHe closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his imagination. On\none of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an evening in\nPetersburg. Natásha with animated and excited face was telling him how\nshe had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost her\nway in the big forest. She incoherently described the depths of the forest,\nher feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she met, and constantly interrupted\nher story to say: “No, I can’t! I’m not telling it right; no, you don’t\nunderstand,” though he encouraged her by saying that he did understand,\nand he really had understood all she wanted to say.

Prince Andrew smiled now the same happy smile as\nthen when he had looked into her eyes. “I understood her,” he thought. “I\nnot only understood her, but it was just that inner, spiritual force, that\nsincerity, that frankness of soul—that very soul of hers which seemed to be\nfettered by her body—it was that soul I loved in her... loved so strongly and\nhappily...” and suddenly he remembered how his love had ended. “He did\nnot need anything of that kind. He neither saw nor understood anything of\nthe sort. He only saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl, with whom he did\nnot deign to unite his fate.

Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now his back and\nnow his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing\nhim down. Another valet, with his finger over the mouth of a bottle, was\nsprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor’s pampered body with an\nexpression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much\nEau de Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleon’s short hair was wet and\nmatted on the forehead, but his face, though puffy and yellow, expressed\nphysical satisfaction. “Go on, harder, go on!” he muttered to the valet who\nwas rubbing him, slightly twitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp, who\nhad entered the bedroom to report to the Emperor the number of prisoners\ntaken in yesterday’s action, was standing by the door after delivering his\nmessage, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon, frowning, looked at\nhim from under his brows.\n“No prisoners!” said he, repeating the aide-de-camp’s words. “They are\nforcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the Russian army....\nGo on... harder, harder!” he muttered, hunching his back and presenting his\nfat shoulders."}, {"page": 1085, "text": "“All right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too,” he said,\nnodding to the aide-de-camp.\n“Yes, sire,” and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of the\ntent.\nTwo valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform of\nthe Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.\nDe Beausset’s hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the\npresent he had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in front of\nthe entrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected\nrapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise.\nNapoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they\nwere not ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving\nhim a surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to\nhim, listening silently and with a stern frown to what Fabvier told him of\nthe heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at the other\nend of Europe, with but one thought—to be worthy of their Emperor—and\nbut one fear—to fail to please him. The result of that battle had been\ndeplorable. Napoleon made ironic remarks during Fabvier’s account, as if\nhe had not expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence.\n“I must make up for that in Moscow,” said Napoleon. “I’ll see you later,”\nhe added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had prepared the\nsurprise, having placed something on the chairs and covered it with a cloth.\nDe Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the old\nretainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him,\npresenting an envelope.\nNapoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.\n“You have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?” he\nasked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial\ntone.\n“Sire, all Paris regrets your absence,” replied de Beausset as was proper.\nBut though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of this\nkind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he was\npleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching his ear.\n“I am very sorry to have made you travel so far,” said he."}, {"page": 1086, "text": "“Sire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of Moscow,”\nreplied de Beausset.\nNapoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the\nright. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a\ngold snuffbox, which he took.\n“Yes, it has happened luckily for you,” he said, raising the open snuffbox\nto his nose. “You are fond of travel, and in three days you will see Moscow.\nYou surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital. You will have a\npleasant journey.”\nDe Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel (of\nwhich he had not till then been aware).\n“Ha, what’s this?” asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers were\nlooking at something concealed under a cloth.\nWith courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without turning his\nback to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the cloth at the same\ntime, and said:\n“A present to Your Majesty from the Empress.”\nIt was a portrait, painted in bright colors by Gérard, of the son borne to\nNapoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy whom for\nsome reason everyone called “The King of Rome.”\nA very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine\nMadonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball represented the\nterrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.\nThough it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the\nso-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory\napparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in\nParis, quite clear and very pleasing.\n“The King of Rome!” he said, pointing to the portrait with a graceful\ngesture. “Admirable!”\nWith the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the expression of his\nface at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of pensive\ntenderness. He felt that what he now said and did would be historical, and it\nseemed to him that it would now be best for him—whose grandeur enabled\nhis son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial globe—to show, in contrast\nto that grandeur, the simplest paternal tenderness. His eyes grew dim, he"}, {"page": 1087, "text": "moved forward, glanced round at a chair (which seemed to place itself\nunder him), and sat down on it before the portrait. At a single gesture from\nhim everyone went out on tiptoe, leaving the great man to himself and his\nemotion.\nHaving sat still for a while he touched—himself not knowing why—the\nthick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait, rose, and\nrecalled de Beausset and the officer on duty.

Vive le roi de Rome! Vive l’Empereur!” came those\necstatic cries.\nAfter breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset’s presence dictated his order of\nthe day to the army.\n“Short and energetic!” he remarked when he had read over the\nproclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections.

Let it be said of each of you: “He was in\nthe great battle before Moscow!”\n“Before Moscow!” repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who\nwas so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of the tent\nto where the horses stood saddled.\n“Your Majesty is too kind!” replied de Beausset to the invitation to\naccompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride and\nwas afraid of doing so.\nBut Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount.\nWhen Napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before his\nson’s portrait grew still louder.

That part of the\nline was not entrenched and in front of it the ground was more open and\nlevel than elsewhere. It was evident to anyone, military or not, that it was\nhere the French should attack. It would seem that not much consideration\nwas needed to reach this conclusion, nor any particular care or trouble on\nthe part of the Emperor and his marshals, nor was there any need of that\nspecial and supreme quality called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to\nNapoleon; yet the historians who described the event later and the men who\nthen surrounded Napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.\nNapoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound\nair and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously, and\nwithout communicating to the generals around him the profound course of\nideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final conclusions in\nthe form of commands. Having listened to a suggestion from Davout, who\nwas now called Prince d’Eckmühl, to turn the Russian left wing, Napoleon\nsaid it should not be done, without explaining why not. To a proposal made\nby General Campan (who was to attack the flèches) to lead his division\nthrough the woods, Napoleon agreed, though the so-called Duke of\nElchingen (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement through the woods\nwas dangerous and might disorder the division.\nHaving inspected the country opposite the Shevárdino Redoubt,\nNapoleon pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two\nbatteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the Russian"}, {"page": 1090, "text": "entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them, the field artillery\nshould be placed.\nAfter giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the\ndispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.\nThese dispositions, of which the French historians write with enthusiasm\nand other historians with profound respect, were as follows:\nAt dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plain\noccupied by the Prince d’Eckmühl will open fire on the opposing batteries\nof the enemy.\nAt the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps, General\nPernetti, with thirty cannon of Campan’s division and all the howitzers of\nDessaix’s and Friant’s divisions, will move forward, open fire, and\noverwhelm with shellfire the enemy’s battery, against which will operate:\n        24 guns of the artillery of the Guards\n        30 guns of Campan’s division\n and     8 guns of Friant’s and Dessaix’s divisions\n        —\n in all 62 guns.\nThe commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouché, will\nplace the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all, on the flanks of\nthe battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left, which will have\nforty guns in all directed against it.\nGeneral Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the\nhowitzers of the Guard’s artillery against either one or other of the\nentrenchments.\nDuring the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the\nwood on the village and turn the enemy’s position.\nGeneral Campan will move through the wood to seize the first\nfortification.\nAfter the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given in\naccordance with the enemy’s movements.\nThe cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the\nright wing are heard.

This could not be done, as from the\nspots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the Russian\nworks, and those 102 guns shot into the air until the nearest commander,\ncontrary to Napoleon’s instructions, moved them forward.\nThe second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through the\nwood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could not be done and was\nnot done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village through the wood,\nmet Túchkov there barring his way, and could not and did not turn the\nRussian position.\nThe third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to\nseize the first fortification. General Campan’s division did not seize the first\nfortification but was driven back, for on emerging from the wood it had to\nreform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was unaware.\nThe fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village (Borodinó)\nand cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as Morand’s\nand Gérard’s divisions (for whose movements no directions are given),"}, {"page": 1092, "text": "which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come\ninto line with the rest of the forces.\nAs far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible sentence\nas from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders given him,\nhe was to advance from the left through Borodinó to the redoubt while the\ndivisions of Morand and Gérard were to advance simultaneously from the\nfront.\nAll this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could not be\nexecuted. After passing through Borodinó the vice-King was driven back to\nthe Kolochá and could get no farther; while the divisions of Morand and\nGérard did not take the redoubt but were driven back, and the redoubt was\nonly taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry (a thing probably\nunforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon). So not one of the orders in the\ndisposition was, or could be, executed. But in the disposition it is said that,\nafter the fight has commenced in this manner, orders will be given in\naccordance with the enemy’s movements, and so it might be supposed that\nall necessary arrangements would be made by Napoleon during the battle.\nBut this was not and could not be done, for during the whole battle\nNapoleon was so far away that, as appeared later, he could not know the\ncourse of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be\nexecuted."}, {"page": 1093, "text": "CHAPTER XXVIII\nMany historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodinó\nbecause Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the orders he\ngave before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius\nand Russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been\nchanged. To historians who believe that Russia was shaped by the will of\none man—Peter the Great—and that France from a republic became an\nempire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one man—Napoleon\n—to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a bad cold on\nthe twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing.\nIf it had depended on Napoleon’s will to fight or not to fight the battle of\nBorodinó, and if this or that other arrangement depended on his will, then\nevidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will might have saved\nRussia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring Napoleon his\nwaterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been the savior of\nRussia. Along that line of thought such a deduction is indubitable, as\nindubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest (without knowing what he\nwas jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was due\nto Charles IX’s stomach being deranged. But to men who do not admit that\nRussia was formed by the will of one man, Peter I, or that the French\nEmpire was formed and the war with Russia begun by the will of one man,\nNapoleon, that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational, but\ncontrary to all human reality. To the question of what causes historic events\nanother answer presents itself, namely, that the course of human events is\npredetermined from on high—depends on the coincidence of the wills of all\nwho take part in the events, and that a Napoleon’s influence on the course\nof these events is purely external and fictitious.\nStrange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the Massacre of St.\nBartholomew was not due to Charles IX’s will, though he gave the order for\nit and thought it was done as a result of that order; and strange as it may"}, {"page": 1094, "text": "seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand men at Borodinó was\nnot due to Napoleon’s will, though he ordered the commencement and\nconduct of the battle and thought it was done because he ordered it; strange\nas these suppositions appear, yet human dignity—which tells me that each\nof us is, if not more at least not less a man than the great Napoleon—\ndemands the acceptance of that solution of the question, and historic\ninvestigation abundantly confirms it.\nAt the battle of Borodinó Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one. That\nwas all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who killed people.\nThe French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of Borodinó\nnot because of Napoleon’s orders but by their own volition. The whole\narmy—French, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch—hungry, ragged, and\nweary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to\nMoscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk. Had Napoleon then\nforbidden them to fight the Russians, they would have killed him and have\nproceeded to fight the Russians because it was inevitable.\nWhen they heard Napoleon’s proclamation offering them, as\ncompensation for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about their\nhaving been in the battle before Moscow, they cried “Vive l’Empereur!”\njust as they had cried “Vive l’Empereur!” at the sight of the portrait of the\nboy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just as they would\nhave cried “Vive l’Empereur!” at any nonsense that might be told them.\nThere was nothing left for them to do but cry “Vive l’Empereur!” and go to\nfight, in order to get food and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it was not\nbecause of Napoleon’s commands that they killed their fellow men.\nAnd it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for none\nof his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what was\ngoing on before him. So the way in which these people killed one another\nwas not decided by Napoleon’s will but occurred independently of him, in\naccord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in\nthe common action. It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took place by his\nwill. And so the question whether he had or had not a cold has no more\nhistoric interest than the cold of the least of the transport soldiers.\nMoreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the\ncause of his dispositions not being as well-planned as on former occasions,\nand of his orders during the battle not being as good as previously, is quite"}, {"page": 1095, "text": "baseless, which again shows that Napoleon’s cold on the twenty-sixth of\nAugust was unimportant.\nThe dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even better, than\nprevious dispositions by which he had won victories. His pseudo-orders\nduring the battle were also no worse than formerly, but much the same as\nusual. These dispositions and orders only seem worse than previous ones\nbecause the battle of Borodinó was the first Napoleon did not win. The\nprofoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad, and\nevery learned militarist criticizes them with looks of importance, when they\nrelate to a battle that has been lost, and the very worst dispositions and\norders seem very good, and serious people fill whole volumes to\ndemonstrate their merits, when they relate to a battle that has been won.\nThe dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were\na model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still they were\ncriticized—criticized for their very perfection, for their excessive\nminuteness.\nNapoleon at the battle of Borodinó fulfilled his office as representative of\nauthority as well as, and even better than, at other battles. He did nothing\nharmful to the progress of the battle; he inclined to the most reasonable\nopinions, he made no confusion, did not contradict himself, did not get\nfrightened or run away from the field of battle, but with his great tact and\nmilitary experience carried out his role of appearing to command, calmly\nand with dignity."}, {"page": 1096, "text": "CHAPTER XXIX\nOn returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon remarked:\n“The chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!”\nHaving ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to talk to\nhim about Paris and about some changes he meant to make in the Empress’\nhousehold, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details relating\nto the court.\nHe showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beausset’s love of travel,\nand chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon who knows his\njob does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron while a\npatient is being strapped to the operating table. “The matter is in my hands\nand is clear and definite in my head. When the time comes to set to work I\nshall do it as no one else could, but now I can jest, and the more I jest and\nthe calmer I am the more tranquil and confident you ought to be, and the\nmore amazed at my genius.”\nHaving finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest before\nthe serious business which, he considered, awaited him next day. He was so\nmuch interested in that task that he was unable to sleep, and in spite of his\ncold which had grown worse from the dampness of the evening, he went\ninto the large division of the tent at three o’clock in the morning, loudly\nblowing his nose. He asked whether the Russians had not withdrawn, and\nwas told that the enemy’s fires were still in the same places. He nodded\napproval.\nThe adjutant in attendance came into the tent.\n“Well, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?” Napoleon\nasked him.\n“Without doubt, sire,” replied Rapp.\nNapoleon looked at him."}, {"page": 1097, "text": "“Do you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at\nSmolénsk?” continued Rapp. “The wine is drawn and must be drunk.”\nNapoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his\nhand.\n“This poor army!” he suddenly remarked. “It has diminished greatly\nsince Smolénsk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always said so\nand I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the Guards are\nintact?” he remarked interrogatively.\n“Yes, sire,” replied Rapp.\nNapoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his watch.\nHe was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was impossible to\ngive further orders for the sake of killing time, for the orders had all been\ngiven and were now being executed.\n“Have the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the\nGuards?” asked Napoleon sternly.\n“Yes, sire.”\n“The rice too?”\nRapp replied that he had given the Emperor’s order about the rice, but\nNapoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his order\nhad been executed. An attendant came in with punch. Napoleon ordered\nanother glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently sipped his own.\n“I have neither taste nor smell,” he remarked, sniffing at his glass. “This\ncold is tiresome. They talk about medicine—what is the good of medicine\nwhen it can’t cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges but they don’t\nhelp at all. What can doctors cure? One can’t cure anything. Our body is a\nmachine for living. It is organized for that, it is its nature. Let life go on in it\nunhindered and let it defend itself, it will do more than if you paralyze it by\nencumbering it with remedies. Our body is like a perfect watch that should\ngo for a certain time; the watchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it\nby fumbling, and that blindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for living,\nthat is all.”\nAnd having entered on the path of definition, of which he was fond,\nNapoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.\n“Do you know, Rapp, what military art is?” asked he. “It is the art of\nbeing stronger than the enemy at a given moment. That’s all.”"}, {"page": 1098, "text": "Rapp made no reply.\n“Tomorrow we shall have to deal with Kutúzov!” said Napoleon. “We\nshall see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three\nweeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments.... We\nshall see!”\nHe looked at his watch. It was still only four o’clock. He did not feel\nsleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do. He rose,\nwalked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went out of the\ntent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible moisture was\ndescending from above. Near by, the campfires were dimly burning among\nthe French Guards, and in the distance those of the Russian line shone\nthrough the smoke. The weather was calm, and the rustle and tramp of the\nFrench troops already beginning to move to take up their positions were\nclearly audible.\nNapoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires and\nlistened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a shaggy\ncap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn himself up\nlike a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon stopped in front of him.\n“What year did you enter the service?” he asked with that affectation of\nmilitary bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the\nsoldiers.\nThe man answered the question.\n“Ah! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?”\n“It has, Your Majesty.”\nNapoleon nodded and walked away.\nAt half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shevárdino.\nIt was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud lay in the\neast.

The panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was\nshaking him.\n“Your excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!” he kept repeating\npertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at\nhim, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.\n“What? Has it begun? Is it time?” Pierre asked, waking up.\n“Hear the firing,” said the groom, a discharged soldier. “All the\ngentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past long\nago.”\nPierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was bright,\nfresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from behind a cloud\nthat had concealed it, was shining, with rays still half broken by the clouds,\nover the roofs of the street opposite, on the dew-besprinkled dust of the\nroad, on the walls of the houses, on the windows, the fence, and on Pierre’s\nhorses standing before the hut. The roar of guns sounded more distinct\noutside. An adjutant accompanied by a Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.\n“It’s time, Count; it’s time!” cried the adjutant.\nTelling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down the\nstreet to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the day\nbefore. A crowd of military men was assembled there, members of the staff\ncould be heard conversing in French, and Kutúzov’s gray head in a white\ncap with a red band was visible, his gray nape sunk between his shoulders.\nHe was looking through a field glass down the highroad before him."}, {"page": 1101, "text": "Mounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before him,\nspellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired from that\nspot the day before, but now the whole place was full of troops and covered\nby smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting rays of the bright sun,\nrising slightly to the left behind Pierre, cast upon it through the clear\nmorning air penetrating streaks of rosy, golden-tinted light and long dark\nshadows. The forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama seemed\ncarved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green color; its undulating\noutline was silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond Valúevo\nby the Smolénsk highroad crowded with troops. Nearer at hand glittered\ngolden cornfields interspersed with copses. There were troops to be seen\neverywhere, in front and to the right and left. All this was vivid, majestic,\nand unexpected; but what impressed Pierre most of all was the view of the\nbattlefield itself, of Borodinó and the hollows on both sides of the Kolochá.\nAbove the Kolochá, in Borodinó and on both sides of it, especially to the\nleft where the Vóyna flowing between its marshy banks falls into the\nKolochá, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve, and to\nbecome translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored\nand outlined everything. The smoke of the guns mingled with this mist, and\nover the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning sun\nwere reflected, flashing back like lightning from the water, from the dew,\nand from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks and\nin Borodinó. A white church could be seen through the mist, and here and\nthere the roofs of huts in Borodinó as well as dense masses of soldiers, or\ngreen ammunition chests and ordnance. And all this moved, or seemed to\nmove, as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space. Just as in the\nmist-enveloped hollow near Borodinó, so along the entire line outside and\nabove it and especially in the woods and fields to the left, in the valleys and\non the summits of the high ground, clouds of powder smoke seemed\ncontinually to spring up out of nothing, now singly, now several at a time,\nsome translucent, others dense, which, swelling, growing, rolling, and\nblending, extended over the whole expanse.\nThese puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of the firing\nproduced the chief beauty of the spectacle.\n“Puff!”—suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging\nfrom violet into gray and milky white, and “boom!” came the report a"}, {"page": 1102, "text": "second later.\n“Puff! puff!”—and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending\ntogether; and “boom, boom!” came the sounds confirming what the eye had\nseen.\nPierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a round\ncompact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating to\none side, and—“puff” (with a pause)—“puff, puff!” three and then four\nmore appeared and then from each, with the same interval—“boom—boom,\nboom!” came the fine, firm, precise sounds in reply. It seemed as if those\nsmoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods, fields,\nand glittering bayonets ran past them. From the left, over fields and bushes,\nthose large balls of smoke were continually appearing followed by their\nsolemn reports, while nearer still, in the hollows and woods, there burst\nfrom the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls, but had\ntheir little echoes in just the same way. “Trakh-ta-ta-takh!” came the\nfrequent crackle of musketry, but it was irregular and feeble in comparison\nwith the reports of the cannon.\nPierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets, that\nmovement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kutúzov and his suite, to\ncompare his impressions with those of others. They were all looking at the\nfield of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the same feelings.\nAll their faces were now shining with that latent warmth of feeling Pierre\nhad noticed the day before and had fully understood after his talk with\nPrince Andrew.\n“Go, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!” Kutúzov was saying\nto a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from the battlefield.\nHaving received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down\nthe knoll.\n“To the crossing!” said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one of\nthe staff who asked where he was going.\n“I’ll go there too, I too!” thought Pierre, and followed the general.\nThe general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went to\nhis groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the quietest,\nclambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out his toes pressed his\nheels against its sides and, feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but"}, {"page": 1103, "text": "unable to let go of the mane and reins, he galloped after the general, causing\nthe staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll."}, {"page": 1104, "text": "CHAPTER XXXI\nHaving descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping\nturned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped in among\nsome ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to pass either in\nfront of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers everywhere, all\nwith the same preoccupied expression and busy with some unseen but\nevidently important task. They all gazed with the same dissatisfied and\ninquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat, who for some\nunknown reason threatened to trample them under his horse’s hoofs.\n“Why ride into the middle of the battalion?” one of them shouted at him.\nAnother prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre,\nbending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse,\ngalloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.\nThere was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood firing. Pierre\nrode up to them. Without being aware of it he had come to the bridge across\nthe Kolochá between Górki and Borodinó, which the French (having\noccupied Borodinó) were attacking in the first phase of the battle. Pierre\nsaw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing\nsomething on both sides of it and in the meadow, among the rows of new-\nmown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the\ncampfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing going on there he\nhad no idea that this was the field of battle. He did not notice the sound of\nthe bullets whistling from every side, or the projectiles that flew over him,\ndid not see the enemy on the other side of the river, and for a long time did\nnot notice the killed and wounded, though many fell near him. He looked\nabout him with a smile which did not leave his face.\n“Why’s that fellow in front of the line?” shouted somebody at him again.\n“To the left!... Keep to the right!” the men shouted to him."}, {"page": 1105, "text": "Pierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of Raévski’s\nadjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently also\nintending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded.\n“How have you got here?” he said, and galloped on.\nPierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of\ngetting in someone’s way again, galloped after the adjutant.\n“What’s happening here? May I come with you?” he asked.\n“One moment, one moment!” replied the adjutant, and riding up to a\nstout colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message\nand then addressed Pierre.\n“Why have you come here, Count?” he asked with a smile. “Still\ninquisitive?”\n“Yes, yes,” assented Pierre.\nBut the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.\n“Here it’s tolerable,” said he, “but with Bagratión on the left flank they’re\ngetting it frightfully hot.”\n“Really?” said Pierre. “Where is that?”\n“Come along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and in\nour battery it is still bearable,” said the adjutant. “Will you come?”\n“Yes, I’ll come with you,” replied Pierre, looking round for his groom.\nIt was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being\ncarried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over the day\nbefore, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay, with his head\nthrown awkwardly back and his shako off.\n“Why haven’t they carried him away?” Pierre was about to ask, but\nseeing the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way,\nhe checked himself.\nPierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the adjutant\nto Raévski’s Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the adjutant’s and jolted him\nat every step.\n“You don’t seem to be used to riding, Count?” remarked the adjutant.\n“No it’s not that, but her action seems so jerky,” said Pierre in a puzzled\ntone."}, {"page": 1106, "text": "“Why... she’s wounded!” said the adjutant. “In the off foreleg above the\nknee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your baptism of\nfire!”\nHaving ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the artillery\nwhich had been moved forward and was in action, deafening them with the\nnoise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was cool and quiet, with\na scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up the\nhill on foot.\n“Is the general here?” asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.\n“He was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,” someone told\nhim, pointing to the right.\nThe adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.\n“Don’t trouble about me,” said Pierre. “I’ll go up onto the knoll if I\nmay?”\n“Yes, do. You’ll see everything from there and it’s less dangerous, and\nI’ll come for you.”\nPierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not meet\nagain, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that day.\nThe knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards\nknown to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Raévski’s Redoubt, and to\nthe French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre,\naround which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as the\nkey to the whole position.\nThis redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which trenches had\nbeen dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired\nthrough openings in the earthwork.\nIn line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired\nincessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When ascending that\nknoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which small trenches had been\ndug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most important point\nof the battle.\nOn the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought it one of\nthe least significant parts of the field."}, {"page": 1107, "text": "Having reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench\nsurrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with an\nunconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about the\nbattery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the soldiers who\nwere loading, hauling the guns, and continually running past him with bags\nand charges. The guns of that battery were being fired continually one after\nanother with a deafening roar, enveloping the whole neighborhood in\npowder smoke.\nIn contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support, here\nin the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were\nseparated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced a common and as\nit were family feeling of animation.\nThe intrusion of Pierre’s nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an\nunpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at him with\nsurprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior artillery officer, a\ntall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if to see the\naction of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity.\nA young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only just out\nof the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two guns\nentrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.\n“Sir,” he said, “permit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not be\nhere.”\nThe soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre.\nBut when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat was\ndoing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench with a shy\nsmile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up and down the\nbattery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard, their feeling of\nhostile distrust gradually began to change into a kindly and bantering\nsympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs, cocks, goats, and in general\nfor the animals that live with the regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre\ninto their family, adopted him, gave him a nickname (“our gentleman”), and\nmade kindly fun of him among themselves.\nA shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around\nwith a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up.\n“And how’s it you’re not afraid, sir, really now?” a red-faced, broad-\nshouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set of sound,"}, {"page": 1108, "text": "white teeth.\n“Are you afraid, then?” said Pierre.\n“What else do you expect?” answered the soldier. “She has no mercy,\nyou know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards. One\ncan’t help being afraid,” he said laughing.\nSeveral of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre. They\nseemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and the\ndiscovery that he did so delighted them.\n“It’s the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it’s wonderful!\nThere’s a gentleman for you!”\n“To your places!” cried the young officer to the men gathered round\nPierre.\nThe young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or\nsecond time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with great\nprecision and formality.\nThe booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing\nmore intense over the whole field, especially to the left where Bagratión’s\nflèches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it almost\nimpossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole attention was\nengrossed by watching the family circle—separated from all else—formed\nby the men in the battery. His first unconscious feeling of joyful animation\nproduced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was now replaced by\nanother, especially since he had seen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield.\nNow, seated on the slope of the trench, he observed the faces of those\naround him.\nBy ten o’clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the\nbattery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more\nfrequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around. But\nthe men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and merry voices and jokes\nwere heard on all sides.\n“A live one!” shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.\n“Not this way! To the infantry!” added another with loud laughter, seeing\nthe shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.\n“Are you bowing to a friend, eh?” remarked another, chaffing a peasant\nwho ducked low as a cannon ball flew over."}, {"page": 1109, "text": "Several soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out to see\nwhat was happening in front.\n“They’ve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,” said they, pointing\nover the earthwork.\n“Mind your own business,” an old sergeant shouted at them. “If they’ve\nretired it’s because there’s work for them to do farther back.”\nAnd the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a\nshove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.\n“To the fifth gun, wheel it up!” came shouts from one side.\n“Now then, all together, like bargees!” rose the merry voices of those\nwho were moving the gun.\n“Oh, she nearly knocked our gentleman’s hat off!” cried the red-faced\nhumorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. “Awkward baggage!” he added\nreproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man’s leg.\n“Now then, you foxes!” said another, laughing at some militiamen who,\nstooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.\n“So this gruel isn’t to your taste? Oh, you crows! You’re scared!” they\nshouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg\nhad been torn off.\n“There, lads... oh, oh!” they mimicked the peasants, “they don’t like it at\nall!”\nPierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after every\nloss, the liveliness increased more and more.\nAs the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and\nrapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in opposition to what\nwas taking place, the lightning of hidden fire growing more and more\nintense glowed in the faces of these men.\nPierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know\nwhat was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire\nwhich burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the\nsame way in his own soul.\nAt ten o’clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of the\nbattery and along the Kámenka streamlet retreated. From the battery they\ncould be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on their muskets."}, {"page": 1110, "text": "A general with his suite came to the battery, and after speaking to the\ncolonel gave Pierre an angry look and went away again having ordered the\ninfantry supports behind the battery to lie down, so as to be less exposed to\nfire. After this from amid the ranks of infantry to the right of the battery\ncame the sound of a drum and shouts of command, and from the battery one\nsaw how those ranks of infantry moved forward.\nPierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck by a\npale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was walking\nbackwards and kept glancing uneasily around.\nThe ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their long-\ndrawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few minutes\nlater crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from that\ndirection. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the battery.\nSeveral men were lying about who had not been removed. Around the\ncannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No one any longer\ntook notice of Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted at for being in the way.\nThe senior officer moved with big, rapid strides from one gun to another\nwith a frowning face. The young officer, with his face still more flushed,\ncommanded the men more scrupulously than ever.

Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before, now\nheard nothing else.

He saw the senior officer lying on\nthe earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something down\nbelow and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was struggling\nforward shouting “Brothers!” and trying to free himself from some men\nwho were holding him by the arm. He also saw something else that was\nstrange.\nBut he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, that the\nsoldier shouting “Brothers!” was a prisoner, and that another man had been\nbayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had he run into the redoubt\nbefore a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in a blue uniform rushed on him\nsword in hand, shouting something. Instinctively guarding against the shock\n—for they had been running together at full speed before they saw one\nanother—Pierre put out his hands and seized the man (a French officer) by\nthe shoulder with one hand and by the throat with the other. The officer,\ndropping his sword, seized Pierre by his collar.\nFor some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another’s\nunfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and what\nthey were to do next. “Am I taken prisoner or have I taken him prisoner?”\neach was thinking. But the French officer was evidently more inclined to\nthink he had been taken prisoner because Pierre’s strong hand, impelled by\ninstinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever tighter and tighter. The Frenchman\nwas about to say something, when just above their heads, terrible and low, a\ncannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre that the French officer’s head\nhad been torn off, so swiftly had he ducked it."}, {"page": 1113, "text": "Pierre too bent his head and let his hands fall.

But before he reached the foot of the\nknoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian soldiers who, stumbling,\ntripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and wildly toward the battery. (This\nwas the attack for which Ermólov claimed the credit, declaring that only his\ncourage and good luck made such a feat possible: it was the attack in which\nhe was said to have thrown some St. George’s Crosses he had in his pocket\ninto the battery for the first soldiers to take who got there.)\nThe French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops shouting\n“Hurrah!” pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult to call\nthem back.\nThe prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was\na wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds of\nwounded—some known to Pierre and some unknown—Russians and\nFrench, with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were carried\non stretchers from the battery. Pierre again went up onto the knoll where he\nhad spent over an hour, and of that family circle which had received him as\na member he did not find a single one. There were many dead whom he did\nnot know, but some he recognized. The young officer still sat in the same\nway, bent double, in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth wall. The red-\nfaced man was still twitching, but they did not carry him away.\nPierre ran down the slope once more.\n“Now they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have\ndone!” he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers\nmoving from the battlefield.\nBut behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front and\nespecially to the left, near Semënovsk, something seemed to be seething in\nthe smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish, but even\nincreased to desperation like a man who, straining himself, shrieks with all\nhis remaining strength."}, {"page": 1114, "text": "CHAPTER XXXIII\nThe chief action of the battle of Borodinó was fought within the seven\nthousand feet between Borodinó and Bagratión’s flèches. Beyond that space\nthere was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the Russians with\nUvárov’s cavalry at midday, and on the other side, beyond Utítsa,\nPoniatowski’s collision with Túchkov; but these two were detached and\nfeeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the\nbattlefield. On the field between Borodinó and the flèches, beside the wood,\nthe chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from both\nsides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.\nThe battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred\nguns.\nThen when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions,\nCampan’s and Dessaix’s, advanced from the French right, while Murat’s\ntroops advanced on Borodinó from their left.\nFrom the Shevárdino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the flèches\nwere two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as the crow\nflies to Borodinó, so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there,\nespecially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality. The\nsoldiers of Dessaix’s division advancing against the flèches could only be\nseen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and the flèches.\nAs soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke of the guns and\nmusketry on the flèches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach\non that side of it. Through the smoke glimpses could be caught of\nsomething black—probably men—and at times the glint of bayonets. But\nwhether they were moving or stationary, whether they were French or\nRussian, could not be discovered from the Shevárdino Redoubt.\nThe sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into\nNapoleon’s face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked at the flèches."}, {"page": 1115, "text": "The smoke spread out before them, and at times it looked as if the smoke\nwere moving, at times as if the troops moved. Sometimes shouts were heard\nthrough the firing, but it was impossible to tell what was being done there.\nNapoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and in its\nsmall circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and sometimes\nRussians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he could not tell\nwhere what he had seen was.\nHe descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.\nOccasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed intently at the\nbattlefield.\nBut not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from\nwhere he was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which some\nof his generals had taken their stand, but even from the flèches themselves\n—in which by this time there were now Russian and now French soldiers,\nalternately or together, dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or maddened—\neven at those flèches themselves it was impossible to make out what was\ntaking place. There for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketry\nfire, now Russians were seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now infantry,\nand now cavalry: they appeared, fired, fell, collided, not knowing what to\ndo with one another, screamed, and ran back again.\nFrom the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his\nmarshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress of the\naction, but all these reports were false, both because it was impossible in the\nheat of battle to say what was happening at any given moment and because\nmany of the adjutants did not go to the actual place of conflict but reported\nwhat they had heard from others; and also because while an adjutant was\nriding more than a mile to Napoleon circumstances changed and the news\nhe brought was already becoming false. Thus an adjutant galloped up from\nMurat with tidings that Borodinó had been occupied and the bridge over the\nKolochá was in the hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether\nNapoleon wished the troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the\ntroops should form up on the farther side and wait. But before that order\nwas given—almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodinó—the\nbridge had been retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very skirmish at\nwhich Pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle."}, {"page": 1116, "text": "An adjutant galloped up from the flèches with a pale and frightened face\nand reported to Napoleon that their attack had been repulsed, Campan\nwounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time the adjutant had been told\nthat the French had been repulsed, the flèches had in fact been recaptured\nby other French troops, and Davout was alive and only slightly bruised. On\nthe basis of these necessarily untrustworthy reports Napoleon gave his\norders, which had either been executed before he gave them or could not be\nand were not executed.\nThe marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle but, like\nNapoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and only occasionally\nwent within musket range, made their own arrangements without asking\nNapoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to fire and where\ncavalry should gallop and infantry should run. But even their orders, like\nNapoleon’s, were seldom carried out, and then but partially. For the most\npart things happened contrary to their orders. Soldiers ordered to advance\nran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers ordered to remain where they were,\nsuddenly, seeing Russians unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed\nback and sometimes forward, and the cavalry dashed without orders in\npursuit of the flying Russians. In this way two cavalry regiments galloped\nthrough the Semënovsk hollow and as soon as they reached the top of the\nincline turned round and galloped full speed back again. The infantry\nmoved in the same way, sometimes running to quite other places than those\nthey were ordered to go to. All orders as to where and when to move the\nguns, when to send infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian\ninfantry—all such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to\nthe units concerned, without asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much less\nNapoleon. They did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or\nfor acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at stake is what is\ndearest to man—his own life—and it sometimes seems that safety lies in\nrunning back, sometimes in running forward; and these men who were right\nin the heat of the battle acted according to the mood of the moment. In\nreality, however, all these movements forward and backward did not\nimprove or alter the position of the troops. All their rushing and galloping at\none another did little harm, the harm of disablement and death was caused\nby the balls and bullets that flew over the fields on which these men were\nfloundering about.

The generals re-formed them, but their numbers constantly\ndecreased. In the middle of the day Murat sent his adjutant to Napoleon to\ndemand reinforcements.\nNapoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when Murat’s\nadjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would be routed if\nHis Majesty would let him have another division.\n“Reinforcements?” said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at\nthe adjutant—a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like Murat’s\nown—as though he did not understand his words.\n“Reinforcements!” thought Napoleon to himself. “How can they need\nreinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a\nweak, unentrenched Russian wing?”\n“Tell the King of Naples,” said he sternly, “that it is not noon yet, and I\ndon’t yet see my chessboard clearly.

Send\nFriant’s division.”\nThough there was no advantage in sending Friant’s division instead of\nClaparède’s, and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping\nClaparède and sending Friant now, the order was carried out exactly.\nNapoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the part"}, {"page": 1120, "text": "of a doctor who hinders by his medicines—a role he so justly understood\nand condemned.\nFriant’s division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of the\nbattlefield.

So\nit had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola, Jena, Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on.\nBut now something strange was happening to his troops.\nDespite news of the capture of the flèches, Napoleon saw that this was\nnot the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former\nbattles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about him\nexperienced in the art of war. All their faces looked dejected, and they all\nshunned one another’s eyes—only a de Beausset could fail to grasp the\nmeaning of what was happening.\nBut Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of\na battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all efforts had\nbeen expended.

Yes, it was like a dream in which a man fancies\nthat a ruffian is coming to attack him, and raises his arm to strike that\nruffian a terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him, but then feels\nthat his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag, and the horror of\nunavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness."}, {"page": 1122, "text": "The news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the French\narmy aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a campstool below\nthe knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees. Berthier approached\nand suggested that they should ride along the line to ascertain the position\nof affairs.\n“What? What do you say?” asked Napoleon. “Yes, tell them to bring me\nmy horse.”\nHe mounted and rode toward Semënovsk.\nAmid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space through\nwhich Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of blood, singly\nor in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before seen\nsuch horrors or so many slain in such a small area. The roar of guns, that\nhad not ceased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave a peculiar\nsignificance to the spectacle, as music does to tableaux vivants. Napoleon\nrode up the high ground at Semënovsk, and through the smoke saw ranks of\nmen in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. They were Russians.\nThe Russians stood in serried ranks behind Semënovsk village and its\nknoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forth\nclouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a continuous slaughter\nwhich could be of no avail either to the French or the Russians.

Ney and Berthier, standing near Napoleon,\nexchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this general’s senseless\noffer.\nNapoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.\n“At eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard\ndestroyed!” he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shevárdino."}, {"page": 1123, "text": "CHAPTER XXXV\nOn the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning sat\nKutúzov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no orders,\nbut only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.\n“Yes, yes, do that,” he replied to various proposals. “Yes, yes: go, dear\nboy, and have a look,” he would say to one or another of those about him;\nor, “No, don’t, we’d better wait!” He listened to the reports that were\nbrought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded that of\nhim; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were not interested\nin the import of the words spoken, but rather in something else—in the\nexpression of face and tone of voice of those who were reporting. By long\nyears of military experience he knew, and with the wisdom of age\nunderstood, that it is impossible for one man to direct hundreds of\nthousands of others struggling with death, and he knew that the result of a\nbattle is decided not by the orders of a commander in chief, nor the place\nwhere the troops are stationed, nor by the number of cannon or of\nslaughtered men, but by that intangible force called the spirit of the army,\nand he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in his power.\nKutúzov’s general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention,\nand his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master the\nfatigue of his old and feeble body.\nAt eleven o’clock they brought him news that the flèches captured by the\nFrench had been retaken, but that Prince Bagratión was wounded. Kutúzov\ngroaned and swayed his head.\n“Ride over to Prince Peter Ivánovich and find out about it exactly,” he\nsaid to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of Württemberg\nwho was standing behind him.\n“Will Your Highness please take command of the first army?”"}, {"page": 1124, "text": "Soon after the duke’s departure—before he could possibly have reached\nSemënovsk—his adjutant came back from him and told Kutúzov that the\nduke asked for more troops.\nKutúzov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokhtúrov to take over the\ncommand of the first army, and a request to the duke—whom he said he\ncould not spare at such an important moment—to return to him. When they\nbrought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the staff officers\ncongratulated him, Kutúzov smiled.\n“Wait a little, gentlemen,” said he. “The battle is won, and there is\nnothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is better to wait\nbefore we rejoice.”\nBut he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.\nWhen Scherbínin came galloping from the left flank with news that the\nFrench had captured the flèches and the village of Semënovsk, Kutúzov,\nguessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherbínin’s looks that the news\nwas bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking Scherbínin’s arm, led him\naside.\n“Go, my dear fellow,” he said to Ermólov, “and see whether something\ncan’t be done.”\nKutúzov was in Górki, near the center of the Russian position. The attack\ndirected by Napoleon against our left flank had been several times repulsed.\nIn the center the French had not got beyond Borodinó, and on their left\nflank Uvárov’s cavalry had put the French to flight.\nToward three o’clock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of all who\ncame from the field of battle, and of those who stood around him, Kutúzov\nnoticed an expression of extreme tension.

Wolzogen, noticing “the old\ngentleman’s” agitation, said with a smile:\n“I have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness\nwhat I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder....”\n“You have seen? You have seen?...” Kutúzov shouted. Frowning and\nrising quickly, he went up to Wolzogen.\n“How... how dare you!...” he shouted, choking and making a threatening\ngesture with his trembling arms: “How dare you, sir, say that to me? You\nknow nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me that his information is\nincorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to me, the\ncommander in chief, than to him.”\nWolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but Kutúzov interrupted him.\n“The enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right flank.\nIf you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say what you don’t\nknow!

Toward two o’clock the regiment, having already lost more than two\nhundred men, was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap\nbetween Semënovsk and the Knoll Battery, where thousands of men\nperished that day and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several\nhundred enemy guns was directed between one and two o’clock.\nWithout moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here\nlost another third of its men. From in front and especially from the right, in\nthe unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious domain of\nsmoke that overlay the whole space in front, quick hissing cannon balls and\nslow whistling shells flew unceasingly. At times, as if to allow them a\nrespite, a quarter of an hour passed during which the cannon balls and shells\nall flew overhead, but sometimes several men were torn from the regiment\nin a minute and the slain were continually being dragged away and the\nwounded carried off.\nWith each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not\nyet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred paces\napart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same mood. All\nalike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely heard in the ranks, and it\nceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot and the cry of\n“stretchers!” was heard. Most of the time, by their officers’ order, the men\nsat on the ground. One, having taken off his shako, carefully loosened the\ngathers of its lining and drew them tight again; another, rubbing some dry\nclay between his palms, polished his bayonet; another fingered the strap and\npulled the buckle of his bandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his\nleg bands and put his boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts in\nthe plowed ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. All\nseemed fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men were killed or"}, {"page": 1129, "text": "wounded, when rows of stretchers went past, when some troops retreated,\nand when great masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke, no\none paid any attention to these things. But when our artillery or cavalry\nadvanced or some of our infantry were seen to move forward, words of\napproval were heard on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by\noccurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was as if\nthe minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday,\ncommonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front of the\nregiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace. “Hey,\nlook at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She’ll fall.... Ah, they don’t see\nit!” came identical shouts from the ranks all along the regiment. Another\ntime, general attention was attracted by a small brown dog, coming heaven\nknows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks\nwith tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by, when it yelped,\ntucked its tail between its legs, and darted aside. Yells and shrieks of\nlaughter rose from the whole regiment. But such distractions lasted only a\nmoment, and for eight hours the men had been inactive, without food, in\nconstant fear of death, and their pale and gloomy faces grew ever paler and\ngloomier.\nPrince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, paced up\nand down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge of the\nmeadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back.\nThere was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given. Everything went\non of itself. The killed were dragged from the front, the wounded carried\naway, and the ranks closed up. If any soldiers ran to the rear they returned\nimmediately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew, considering it his duty to\nrouse the courage of the men and to set them an example, walked about\namong the ranks, but he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary\nand that there was nothing he could teach them. All the powers of his soul,\nas of every soldier there, were unconsciously bent on avoiding the\ncontemplation of the horrors of their situation. He walked along the\nmeadow, dragging his feet, rustling the grass, and gazing at the dust that\ncovered his boots; now he took big strides trying to keep to the footprints\nleft on the meadow by the mowers, then he counted his steps, calculating\nhow often he must walk from one strip to another to walk a mile, then he\nstripped the flowers from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut,\nrubbed them in his palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent."}, {"page": 1130, "text": "Nothing remained of the previous day’s thoughts.

Again!\nIt has hit....” He stopped and looked at the ranks. “No, it has gone over. But\nthis one has hit!” And again he started trying to reach the boundary strip in\nsixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five paces from him, a cannon ball tore\nup the dry earth and disappeared. A chill ran down his back. Again he\nglanced at the ranks. Probably many had been hit—a large crowd had\ngathered near the second battalion.\n“Adjutant!” he shouted. “Order them not to crowd together.”\nThe adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew.\nFrom the other side a battalion commander rode up.\n“Look out!” came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird\nwhirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell dropped with\nlittle noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and close to the battalion\ncommander’s horse. The horse first, regardless of whether it was right or\nwrong to show fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the major, and\ngalloped aside. The horse’s terror infected the men.\n“Lie down!” cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.\nPrince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between him\nand the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the field and the\nmeadow.\n“Can this be death?” thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite new,\nenvious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke that\ncurled up from the rotating black ball. “I cannot, I do not wish to die. I love\nlife—I love this grass, this earth, this air....” He thought this, and at the\nsame time remembered that people were looking at him.\n“It’s shameful, sir!” he said to the adjutant. “What...”\nHe did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the sound\nof an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame, a\nsuffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started to one side, raising\nhis arm, and fell on his chest.

My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My\nGod!”—voices among the officers were heard saying.\n“It flew a hair’s breadth past my ear,” said the adjutant.\nThe peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started hurriedly\nalong the path they had trodden down, to the dressing station.\n“Keep in step!

The dressing station consisted of three\ntents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood. In the\nwood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were eating oats from\ntheir movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the grains that\nfell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among the birch trees cawing\nimpatiently. Around the tents, over more than five acres, bloodstained men\nin various garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the wounded stood crowds of"}, {"page": 1132, "text": "soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive faces, whom the officers\nkeeping order tried in vain to drive from the spot. Disregarding the officers’\norders, the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing\nintently, as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking\nplace before them. From the tents came now loud angry cries and now\nplaintive groans. Occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water, or to point\nout those who were to be brought in next. The wounded men awaiting their\nturn outside the tents groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for\nvodka. Some were delirious. Prince Andrew’s bearers, stepping over the\nwounded who had not yet been bandaged, took him, as a regimental\ncommander, close up to one of the tents and there stopped, awaiting\ninstructions. Prince Andrew opened his eyes and for a long time could not\nmake out what was going on around him. He remembered the meadow, the\nwormwood, the field, the whirling black ball, and his sudden rush of\npassionate love of life. Two steps from him, leaning against a branch and\ntalking loudly and attracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome,\nblack-haired noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been\nwounded in the head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his\ntalk, a crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.\n“We kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we\ngrabbed the King himself!” cried he, looking around him with eyes that\nglittered with fever. “If only reserves had come up just then, lads, there\nwouldn’t have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely....”\nLike all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him with\nshining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. “But isn’t it all the same\nnow?” thought he. “And what will be there, and what has there been here?\nWhy was I so reluctant to part with life? There was something in this life I\ndid not and do not understand.”"}, {"page": 1133, "text": "CHAPTER XXXVII\nOne of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron, holding a\ncigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small bloodstained\nhands, so as not to smear it. He raised his head and looked about him, but\nabove the level of the wounded men. He evidently wanted a little respite.\nAfter turning his head from right to left for some time, he sighed and looked\ndown.\n“All right, immediately,” he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince\nAndrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.\nMurmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.\n“It seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a\nchance!” remarked one.\nPrince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been\ncleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince Andrew could not\nmake out distinctly what was in that tent. The pitiful groans from all sides\nand the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distracted him. All he\nsaw about him merged into a general impression of naked, bleeding human\nbodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as a few weeks\npreviously, on that hot August day, such bodies had filled the dirty pond\nbeside the Smolénsk road. Yes, it was the same flesh, the same chair à\ncanon, the sight of which had even then filled him with horror, as by a\npresentiment.\nThere were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied, and on\nthe third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he was left alone and\ninvoluntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two tables. On\nthe nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, judging by the uniform\nthrown down beside him. Four soldiers were holding him, and a spectacled\ndoctor was cutting into his muscular brown back."}, {"page": 1134, "text": "“Ooh, ooh, ooh!” grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his swarthy\nsnub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white teeth, he\nbegan to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing, ringing, and\nprolonged yells. On the other table, round which many people were\ncrowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back.\nHis curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely familiar\nto Prince Andrew. Several dressers were pressing on his chest to hold him\ndown. One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly all the time with a\nfeverish tremor. The man was sobbing and choking convulsively. Two\ndoctors—one of whom was pale and trembling—were silently doing\nsomething to this man’s other, gory leg. When he had finished with the\nTartar, whom they covered with an overcoat, the spectacled doctor came up\nto Prince Andrew, wiping his hands.\nHe glanced at Prince Andrew’s face and quickly turned away.\n“Undress him! What are you waiting for?” he cried angrily to the\ndressers.\nHis very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince\nAndrew’s mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to\nundo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The doctor bent down\nover the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he made a sign to someone,\nand the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to lose\nconsciousness. When he came to himself the splintered portions of his\nthighbone had been extracted, the torn flesh cut away, and the wound\nbandaged. Water was being sprinkled on his face. As soon as Prince Andrew\nopened his eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silently on the lips, and\nhurried away.\nAfter the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a\nblissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All the best\nand happiest moments of his life—especially his earliest childhood, when\nhe used to be undressed and put to bed, and when leaning over him his\nnurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head in the pillow, felt happy in\nthe mere consciousness of life—returned to his memory, not merely as\nsomething past but as something present.\nThe doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of\nwhose head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him up and\ntrying to quiet him."}, {"page": 1135, "text": "“Show it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!” his frightened moans could\nbe heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.\nHearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep. Whether because\nhe was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life, or\nbecause of those memories of a childhood that could not return, or because\nhe was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him was\ngroaning so piteously—he felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and almost\nhappy tears.\nThe wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted\nblood and with the boot still on.\n“Oh! Oh, ooh!” he sobbed, like a woman.\nThe doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew\nfrom seeing his face, moved away.\n“My God! What is this? Why is he here?” said Prince Andrew to himself.\nIn the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been\namputated, he recognized Anatole Kurágin. Men were supporting him in\ntheir arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling, swollen lips\ncould not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully. “Yes, it is he! Yes,\nthat man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me,” thought\nPrince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him. “What is\nthe connection of that man with my childhood and life?” he asked himself\nwithout finding an answer. And suddenly a new unexpected memory from\nthat realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to him. He\nremembered Natásha as he had seen her for the first time at the ball in 1810,\nwith her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy face ready for\nrapture, and love and tenderness for her, stronger and more vivid than ever,\nawoke in his soul. He now remembered the connection that existed between\nhimself and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears that filled\nhis swollen eyes. He remembered everything, and ecstatic pity and love for\nthat man overflowed his happy heart.\nPrince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving\ntears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and their errors.\n“Compassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for those\nwho hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God preached on\nearth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not understand—that is"}, {"page": 1136, "text": "what made me sorry to part with life, that is what remained for me had I\nlived.

This day\nthe horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that strength of mind\nwhich he thought constituted his merit and his greatness. He rode hurriedly\nfrom the battlefield and returned to the Shevárdino knoll, where he sat on\nhis campstool, his sallow face swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his nose\nred, and his voice hoarse, involuntarily listening, with downcast eyes, to the\nsounds of firing. With painful dejection he awaited the end of this action, in\nwhich he regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to\narrest. A personal, human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the\nartificial phantasm of life he had served so long. He felt in his own person\nthe sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield. The heaviness\nof his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death\nfor himself. At that moment he did not desire Moscow, or victory, or glory\n(what need had he for any more glory?). The one thing he wished for was\nrest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he had been on the Semënovsk\nheights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring several\nbatteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the fire on the Russian\ntroops crowded in front of Knyazkóvo. Napoleon had assented and had\ngiven orders that news should be brought to him of the effect those batteries\nproduced.\nAn adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns\nhad been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that they still\nheld their ground."}, {"page": 1138, "text": "“Our fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,” said the\nadjutant.\n“They want more!...” said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.\n“Sire?” asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.\n“They want more!” croaked Napoleon frowning. “Let them have it!”\nEven before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and for which\nhe gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him, was\nbeing done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary\ngreatness, and again—as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing\nsomething for itself—he submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy, and\ninhuman role predestined for him.\nAnd not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience\ndarkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening\nlay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the end of his\nlife could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the significance of\nhis actions which were too contrary to goodness and truth, too remote from\neverything human, for him ever to be able to grasp their meaning. He could\nnot disavow his actions, belauded as they were by half the world, and so he\nhad to repudiate truth, goodness, and all humanity.\nNot only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men\nkilled and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as he looked\nat them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and, deceiving\nhimself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that there were five\nRussians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone did he write in a letter\nto Paris that “the battle field was superb,” because fifty thousand corpses\nlay there, but even on the island of St. Helena in the peaceful solitude where\nhe said he intended to devote his leisure to an account of the great deeds he\nhad done, he wrote:\nThe Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern\ntimes: it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the tranquillity and\nsecurity of all; it was purely pacific and conservative.\nIt was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the beginning\nof security.

And meanwhile, the very next\nmorning after the battle, the French army advanced of itself upon the\nRussians, carried forward by the force of its own momentum now\nseemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from\nits aim. Kutúzov’s wish was to attack next day, and the whole army desired\nto do so. But to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient, there\nmust also be a possibility of doing it, and that possibility did not exist. It\nwas impossible not to retreat a day’s march, and then in the same way it\nwas impossible not to retreat another and a third day’s march, and at last, on\nthe first of September when the army drew near Moscow—despite the\nstrength of the feeling that had arisen in all ranks—the force of\ncircumstances compelled it to retire beyond Moscow. And the troops retired\none more, last, day’s march, and abandoned Moscow to the enemy.\nFor people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are\nmade by generals—as anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may\nimagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle—the\nquestions present themselves: Why did Kutúzov during the retreat not do\nthis or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching Filí? Why\ndid he not retire at once by the Kalúga road, abandoning Moscow? and so\non. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know, the\ninevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander in\nchief. The activity of a commander in chief does not at all resemble the\nactivity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in our studies\nexamining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of troops on\nthis and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our plans from some\ngiven moment. A commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of\nany event—the position from which we always contemplate it. The\ncommander in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and"}, {"page": 1152, "text": "so he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that is\noccurring. Moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping itself,\nand at every moment of this continuous, uninterrupted shaping of events the\ncommander in chief is in the midst of a most complex play of intrigues,\nworries, contingencies, authorities, projects, counsels, threats, and\ndeceptions and is continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions\naddressed to him, which constantly conflict with one another.\nLearned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kutúzov should\nhave moved his army to the Kalúga road long before reaching Filí, and that\nsomebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But a commander in\nchief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not one\nproposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these proposals, based on\nstrategics and tactics, contradict each other.\nA commander in chief’s business, it would seem, is simply to choose one\nof these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and time do not wait.\nFor instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to cross to the\nKalúga road, but just then an adjutant gallops up from Milorádovich asking\nwhether he is to engage the French or retire. An order must be given him at\nonce, that instant. And the order to retreat carries us past the turn to the\nKalúga road. And after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking\nwhere the stores are to be taken, and the chief of the hospitals asks where\nthe wounded are to go, and a courier from Petersburg brings a letter from\nthe sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of abandoning\nMoscow, and the commander in chief’s rival, the man who is undermining\nhim (and there are always not merely one but several such), presents a new\nproject diametrically opposed to that of turning to the Kalúga road, and the\ncommander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his\nenergy and a respectable general who has been overlooked in the\ndistribution of rewards comes to complain, and the inhabitants of the\ndistrict pray to be defended, and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes\nin and gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer\npreviously sent; and a spy, a prisoner, and a general who has been on\nreconnaissance, all describe the position of the enemy’s army differently.\nPeople accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions\nof a commander in chief’s actions describe to us, for instance, the position\nof the army at Filí and assume that the commander in chief could, on the\nfirst of September, quite freely decide whether to abandon Moscow or"}, {"page": 1153, "text": "defend it; whereas, with the Russian army less than four miles from\nMoscow, no such question existed.

Think what you are saying!”\nKutúzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond Moscow\nwithout a battle.\nOn the Poklónny Hill, four miles from the Dorogomílov gate of Moscow,\nKutúzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside. A\ngreat crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count Rostopchín, who\nhad come out from Moscow, joined them. This brilliant company separated\ninto several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages of\nthe position, the state of the army, the plans suggested, the situation of\nMoscow, and military questions generally. Though they had not been\nsummoned for the purpose, and though it was not so called, they all felt that\nthis was really a council of war. The conversations all dealt with public\nquestions. If anyone gave or asked for personal news, it was done in a\nwhisper and they immediately reverted to general matters. No jokes, or\nlaughter, or smiles even, were seen among all these men. They evidently all\nmade an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded. And\nall these groups, while talking among themselves, tried to keep near the\ncommander in chief (whose bench formed the center of the gathering) and\nto speak so that he might overhear them. The commander in chief listened\nto what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks,\nbut did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion.\nAfter hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he\ngenerally turned away with an air of disappointment, as though they were\nnot speaking of anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the position\nthat had been chosen, criticizing not the position itself so much as the"}, {"page": 1155, "text": "mental capacity of those who had chosen it. Others argued that a mistake\nhad been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days\nbefore. Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca, which was described\nby Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform. (This\nFrenchman and one of the German princes serving with the Russian army\nwere discussing the siege of Saragossa and considering the possibility of\ndefending Moscow in a similar manner.) Count Rostopchín was telling a\nfourth group that he was prepared to die with the city train bands under the\nwalls of the capital, but that he still could not help regretting having been\nleft in ignorance of what was happening, and that had he known it sooner\nthings would have been different.... A fifth group, displaying the profundity\nof their strategic perceptions, discussed the direction the troops would now\nhave to take. A sixth group was talking absolute nonsense. Kutúzov’s\nexpression grew more and more preoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk\nhe saw only one thing: that to defend Moscow was a physical impossibility\nin the full meaning of those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that\nif any senseless commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would\nresult but the battle would still not take place. It would not take place\nbecause the commanders not merely all recognized the position to be\nimpossible, but in their conversations were only discussing what would\nhappen after its inevitable abandonment. How could the commanders lead\ntheir troops to a field of battle they considered impossible to hold? The\nlower-grade officers and even the soldiers (who too reason) also considered\nthe position impossible and therefore could not go to fight, fully convinced\nas they were of defeat. If Bennigsen insisted on the position being defended\nand others still discussed it, the question was no longer important in itself\nbut only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue. This Kutúzov knew well.\nBennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian\npatriotism (Kutúzov could not listen to this without wincing) by insisting\nthat Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as daylight to\nKutúzov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on Kutúzov who had\nbrought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if it\nsucceeded, to claim the success as his own; or if battle were not given, to\nclear himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow. But this intrigue did not\nnow occupy the old man’s mind. One terrible question absorbed him and to\nthat question he heard no reply from anyone. The question for him now\nwas: “Have I really allowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, and when did I do"}, {"page": 1156, "text": "so? When was it decided? Can it have been yesterday when I ordered Plátov\nto retreat, or was it the evening before, when I had a nap and told Bennigsen\nto issue orders? Or was it earlier still?... When, when was this terrible affair\ndecided? Moscow must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order\nto do so must be given.” To give that terrible order seemed to him\nequivalent to resigning the command of the army. And not only did he love\npower to which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince\nProzoróvski, under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was\nconvinced that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why,\nagainst the Emperor’s wish and by the will of the people, he had been\nchosen commander in chief. He was convinced that he alone could maintain\ncommand of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all the\nworld he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear, and\nhe was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But something\nhad to be decided, and these conversations around him which were\nassuming too free a character must be stopped.\nHe called the most important generals to him.\n“My head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself,” said he, rising from\nthe bench, and he rode to Filí where his carriages were waiting."}, {"page": 1157, "text": "CHAPTER IV\nThe Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the\nbetter and roomier part of Andrew Savostyánov’s hut. The men, women,\nand children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across\nthe passage. Only Malásha, Andrew’s six-year-old granddaughter whom his\nSerene Highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar\nwhile drinking his tea, remained on the top of the brick oven in the larger\nroom. Malásha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the faces,\nuniforms, and decorations of the generals, who one after another came into\nthe room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner under the icons.\n“Granddad” himself, as Malásha in her own mind called Kutúzov, sat apart\nin a dark corner behind the oven. He sat, sunk deep in a folding armchair,\nand continually cleared his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat which,\nthough it was unbuttoned, still seemed to pinch his neck.

Konovnítsyn’s firm, handsome, and\nkindly face was lit up by a tender, sly smile. His glance met Malásha’s, and\nthe expression of his eyes caused the little girl to smile.\nThey were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of inspecting the\nposition was finishing his savory dinner. They waited for him from four till\nsix o’clock and did not begin their deliberations all that time but talked in\nlow tones of other matters.\nOnly when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kutúzov leave his corner\nand draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that had\nbeen placed there to light up his face.\nBennigsen opened the council with the question: “Are we to abandon\nRussia’s ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to defend\nit?” A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a frown on every\nface and only Kutúzov’s angry grunts and occasional cough broke the\nsilence. All eyes were gazing at him. Malásha too looked at “Granddad.”\nShe was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered; he seemed about to\ncry, but this did not last long.\n“Russia’s ancient and sacred capital!” he suddenly said, repeating\nBennigsen’s words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the\nfalse note in them. “Allow me to tell you, your excellency, that that\nquestion has no meaning for a Russian.” (He lurched his heavy body\nforward.) “Such a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The question I\nhave asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one. The\nquestion is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up Moscow without a\nbattle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well as Moscow?\nThat is the question on which I want your opinion,” and he sank back in his\nchair.\nThe discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost.\nAdmitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle at Filí was\nimpossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the love of Moscow, he\nproposed to move troops from the right to the left flank during the night and\nattack the French right flank the following day. Opinions were divided, and\narguments were advanced for and against that project. Ermólov, Dokhtúrov,"}, {"page": 1159, "text": "and Raévski agreed with Bennigsen. Whether feeling it necessary to make a\nsacrifice before abandoning the capital or guided by other, personal\nconsiderations, these generals seemed not to understand that this council\ncould not alter the inevitable course of events and that Moscow was in\neffect already abandoned. The other generals, however, understood it and,\nleaving aside the question of Moscow, spoke of the direction the army\nshould take in its retreat. Malásha, who kept her eyes fixed on what was\ngoing on before her, understood the meaning of the council differently. It\nseemed to her that it was only a personal struggle between “Granddad” and\n“Long-coat” as she termed Bennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful\nwhen they spoke to one another, and in her heart she sided with\n“Granddad.” In the midst of the conversation she noticed “Granddad” give\nBennigsen a quick, subtle glance, and then to her joys she saw that\n“Granddad” said something to “Long-coat” which settled him. Bennigsen\nsuddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room. What so\naffected him was Kutúzov’s calm and quiet comment on the advantage or\ndisadvantage of Bennigsen’s proposal to move troops by night from the\nright to the left flank to attack the French right wing.\n“Gentlemen,” said Kutúzov, “I cannot approve of the count’s plan.\nMoving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous, and\nmilitary history supports that view. For instance...” Kutúzov seemed to\nreflect, searching for an example, then with a clear, naïve look at Bennigsen\nhe added: “Oh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count well\nremembers, and which was... not fully successful, only because our troops\nwere rearranged too near the enemy....”\nThere followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them all.\nThe discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they\nall felt that there was no more to be said.\nDuring one of these pauses Kutúzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to\nspeak. They all looked at him.\n“Well, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken\ncrockery,” said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table. “Gentlemen, I\nhave heard your views.

The people awaited\nthe enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited or tear anyone to\npieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the strength to find what it should\ndo at that most difficult moment. And as soon as the enemy drew near the\nwealthy classes went away abandoning their property, while the poorer\nremained and burned and destroyed what was left.\nThe consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and\nis present in the heart of every Russian.

Those who had quitted Moscow already in July and at the\nbeginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who went away,\ntaking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their\nbelongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by\nphrases or by giving one’s children to save the fatherland and similar\nunnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically, and therefore in\nthe way that always produces the most powerful results."}, {"page": 1162, "text": "“It is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running\naway from Moscow,” they were told.

It was out\nof the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst thing that\ncould happen. They went away even before the battle of Borodinó and still\nmore rapidly after it, despite Rostopchín’s calls to defend Moscow or the\nannouncement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of the\nIberian Mother of God and go to fight, or of the balloons that were to\ndestroy the French, and despite all the nonsense Rostopchín wrote in his\nbroadsheets.

They\nwent away without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense\nand wealthy city being given over to destruction, for a great city with\nwooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be\nburned.

But the abbé,\nthough he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion, was absorbed in\nhis mastery of the matter.\nThe course of the Father Confessor’s arguments ran as follows: “Ignorant\nof the import of what you were undertaking, you made a vow of conjugal"}, {"page": 1167, "text": "fidelity to a man who on his part, by entering the married state without faith\nin the religious significance of marriage, committed an act of sacrilege.\nThat marriage lacked the dual significance it should have had.

If now you married again with the object of bearing children,\nyour sin might be forgiven. But the question is again a twofold one:\nfirstly...”\nBut suddenly Hélène, who was getting bored, said with one of her\nbewitching smiles: “But I think that having espoused the true religion I\ncannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me.”\nThe director of her conscience was astounded at having the case\npresented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbus’ egg. He was\ndelighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil’s progress, but could not\nabandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed.\n“Let us understand one another, Countess,” said he with a smile, and\nbegan refuting his spiritual daughter’s arguments."}, {"page": 1168, "text": "CHAPTER VII\nHélène understood that the question was very simple and easy from the\necclesiastical point of view, and that her directors were making difficulties\nonly because they were apprehensive as to how the matter would be\nregarded by the secular authorities.\nSo she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society.\nShe provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she\nhad told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so that the only way for\nhim to obtain a right over her was to marry her. The elderly magnate was at\nfirst as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage with a woman\nwhose husband was alive, as the younger man had been, but Hélène’s\nimperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as marrying a\nmaiden had its effect on him too. Had Hélène herself shown the least sign\nof hesitation, shame, or secrecy, her cause would certainly have been lost;\nbut not only did she show no signs of secrecy or shame, on the contrary,\nwith good-natured naïveté she told her intimate friends (and these were all\nPetersburg) that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to her and\nthat she loved both and was afraid of grieving either.\nA rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that Hélène wanted to be\ndivorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would have\nopposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the unfortunate and\ninteresting Hélène was in doubt which of the two men she should marry.\nThe question was no longer whether this was possible, but only which was\nthe better match and how the matter would be regarded at court. There\nwere, it is true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of such a\nquestion, who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage,\nbut there were not many such and they remained silent, while the majority\nwere interested in Hélène’s good fortune and in the question which match\nwould be the more advantageous. Whether it was right or wrong to remarry\nwhile one had a husband living they did not discuss, for that question had"}, {"page": 1169, "text": "evidently been settled by people “wiser than you or me,” as they said, and\nto doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk exposing one’s\nstupidity and incapacity to live in society.\nOnly Márya Dmítrievna Akhrosímova, who had come to Petersburg that\nsummer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express an\nopinion contrary to the general one. Meeting Hélène at a ball she stopped\nher in the middle of the room and, amid general silence, said in her gruff\nvoice: “So wives of living men have started marrying again! Perhaps you\nthink you have invented a novelty? You have been forestalled, my dear! It\nwas thought of long ago. It is done in all the brothels,” and with these words\nMárya Dmítrievna, turning up her wide sleeves with her usual threatening\ngesture and glancing sternly round, moved across the room.\nThough people were afraid of Márya Dmítrievna she was regarded in\nPetersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only noticed, and\nrepeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had used, supposing the\nwhole sting of her remark to lie in that word.\nPrince Vasíli, who of late very often forgot what he had said and repeated\none and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his daughter whenever\nhe chanced to see her:\n“Hélène, I have a word to say to you,” and he would lead her aside,\ndrawing her hand downward. “I have heard of certain projects concerning...\nyou know. Well my dear child, you know how your father’s heart rejoices to\nknow that you... You have suffered so much.... But, my dear child, consult\nonly your own heart. That is all I have to say,” and concealing his unvarying\nemotion he would press his cheek against his daughter’s and move away.\nBilíbin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man,\nand who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as Hélène\nalways has—men friends who can never change into lovers—once gave her\nhis view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.\n“Listen, Bilíbin,” said Hélène (she always called friends of that sort by\ntheir surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her white, beringed\nfingers. “Tell me, as you would a sister, what I ought to do. Which of the\ntwo?”\nBilíbin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with a\nsmile on his lips."}, {"page": 1170, "text": "“You are not taking me unawares, you know,” said he. “As a true friend, I\nhave thought and thought again about your affair.

(You know there is some kind of connection.) But if you\nmarry the old count you will make his last days happy, and as widow of the\nGrand... the prince would no longer be making a mésalliance by marrying\nyou,” and Bilíbin smoothed out his forehead.\n“That’s a true friend!” said Hélène beaming, and again touching Bilíbin’s\nsleeve. “But I love them, you know, and don’t want to distress either of\nthem. I would give my life for the happiness of them both.”\nBilíbin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he could\nhelp in that difficulty.\n“Une maîtresse-femme! * That’s what is called putting things squarely.\nShe would like to be married to all three at the same time,” thought he.\n* A masterly woman.\n“But tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?” Bilíbin asked,\nhis reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so naïve a\nquestion. “Will he agree?”\n“Oh, he loves me so!” said Hélène, who for some reason imagined that\nPierre too loved her. “He will do anything for me.”\nBilíbin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.\n“Even divorce you?” said he.\nHélène laughed.\nAmong those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed\nmarriage was Hélène’s mother, Princess Kurágina. She was continually\ntormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned a\nsubject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to the idea.\nShe consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of divorce and\nremarriage during a husband’s lifetime, and the priest told her that it was\nimpossible, and to her delight showed her a text in the Gospel which (as it\nseemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage while the husband is alive.\nArmed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable, she\ndrove to her daughter’s early one morning so as to find her alone."}, {"page": 1171, "text": "Having listened to her mother’s objections, Hélène smiled blandly and\nironically.\n“But it says plainly: ‘Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced...’” said\nthe old princess.\n“Ah, Maman, ne dites pas de bêtises.

The young man who had\nentered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter and\nsidled out of the room.\n“Yes, she is right,” thought the old princess, all her convictions dissipated\nby the appearance of His Highness. “She is right, but how is it that we in\nour irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so simple,” she thought as\nshe got into her carriage.\nBy the beginning of August Hélène’s affairs were clearly defined and she\nwrote a letter to her husband—who, as she imagined, loved her very much\n—informing him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her having embraced"}, {"page": 1172, "text": "the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all the formalities necessary\nfor a divorce, which would be explained to him by the bearer of the letter.\nAnd so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful\nkeeping—Your friend Hélène.\nThis letter was brought to Pierre’s house when he was on the field of\nBorodinó."}, {"page": 1173, "text": "CHAPTER VIII\nToward the end of the battle of Borodinó, Pierre, having run down from\nRaévski’s battery a second time, made his way through a gully to\nKnyazkóvo with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station, and\nseeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still entangled in the\ncrowds of soldiers.\nThe one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away\nquickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and\nreturn to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own\nbed. He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be able to\nunderstand himself and all he had seen and felt. But such ordinary\nconditions of life were nowhere to be found.\nThough shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he\nwas going, still on all sides there was what there had been on the field of\nbattle. There were still the same suffering, exhausted, and sometimes\nstrangely indifferent faces, the same blood, the same soldiers’ overcoats, the\nsame sounds of firing which, though distant now, still aroused terror, and\nbesides this there were the foul air and the dust.\nHaving gone a couple of miles along the Mozháysk road, Pierre sat down\nby the roadside.\nDusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay leaning on his\nelbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved past him in the\ndarkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying\ntoward him with a terrific whizz, and then he shuddered and sat up. He had\nno idea how long he had been there. In the middle of the night three\nsoldiers, having brought some firewood, settled down near him and began\nlighting a fire.\nThe soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire to burn\nand placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and put"}, {"page": 1174, "text": "a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with the smell\nof smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three soldiers were eating and\ntalking among themselves, taking no notice of him.\n“And who may you be?” one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently\nmeaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: “If you want to eat we’ll\ngive you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest man.”\n“I, I...” said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social position as\nmuch as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and better understood by\nthem. “By rights I am a militia officer, but my men are not here. I came to\nthe battle and have lost them.”\n“There now!” said one of the soldiers.\nAnother shook his head.\n“Would you like a little mash?” the first soldier asked, and handed Pierre\na wooden spoon after licking it clean.\nPierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called the\nfood in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any food he had\never tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it, helping himself to large\nspoonfuls and chewing one after another, his face was lit up by the fire and\nthe soldiers looked at him in silence.\n“Where have you to go to? Tell us!” said one of them.\n“To Mozháysk.”\n“You’re a gentleman, aren’t you?”\n“Yes.”\n“And what’s your name?”\n“Peter Kirílych.”\n“Well then, Peter Kirílych, come along with us, we’ll take you there.”\nIn the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozháysk.\nBy the time they got near Mozháysk and began ascending the steep hill\ninto the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on with the\nsoldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill and that\nhe had already passed it. He would not soon have remembered this, such\nwas his state of forgetfulness, had he not halfway up the hill stumbled upon\nhis groom, who had been to look for him in the town and was returning to\nthe inn. The groom recognized Pierre in the darkness by his white hat."}, {"page": 1175, "text": "“Your excellency!” he said. “Why, we were beginning to despair! How is\nit you are on foot?

Pierre\nwent out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all, lay down in\nhis carriage."}, {"page": 1176, "text": "CHAPTER IX\nScarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself\nfalling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness of reality, he heard\nthe boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of projectiles, groans and cries,\nand smelled blood and powder, and a feeling of horror and dread of death\nseized him. Filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head from\nunder his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only someone’s orderly\npassed through the gateway, splashing through the mud, and talked to the\ninnkeeper. Above Pierre’s head some pigeons, disturbed by the movement\nhe had made in sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse.\nThe whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable\nyards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see the clear starry sky\nbetween the dark roofs of two penthouses.\n“Thank God, there is no more of that!” he thought, covering up his head\nagain. “Oh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I yielded to it!\nBut they... they were steady and calm all the time, to the end...” thought he.\nThey, in Pierre’s mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the\nbattery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before\nthe icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out\nclearly and sharply from everyone else.\n“To be a soldier, just a soldier!” thought Pierre as he fell asleep, “to enter\ncommunal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them what they\nare. But how to cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer\nman? There was a time when I could have done it. I could have run away\nfrom my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been sent to serve as a\nsoldier after the duel with Dólokhov.” And the memory of the dinner at the\nEnglish Club when he had challenged Dólokhov flashed through Pierre’s\nmind, and then he remembered his benefactor at Torzhók. And now a\npicture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind. It was\ntaking place at the English Club and someone near and dear to him sat at"}, {"page": 1177, "text": "the end of the table. “Yes, that is he! It is my benefactor. But he died!”\nthought Pierre. “Yes, he died, and I did not know he was alive. How sorry I\nam that he died, and how glad I am that he is alive again!” On one side of\nthe table sat Anatole, Dólokhov, Nesvítski, Denísov, and others like them\n(in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as clearly\ndefined in his mind as the category of those he termed they), and he heard\nthose people, Anatole and Dólokhov, shouting and singing loudly; yet\nthrough their shouting the voice of his benefactor was heard speaking all\nthe time and the sound of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted as the\nbooming on the battlefield, but pleasant and comforting. Pierre did not\nunderstand what his benefactor was saying, but he knew (the categories of\nthoughts were also quite distinct in his dream) that he was talking of\ngoodness and the possibility of being what they were. And they with their\nsimple, kind, firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though\nthey were kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him. Wishing\nto speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that moment his legs\ngrew cold and bare.\nHe felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak\nhad in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre\nopened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs, posts, and yard, but now\nthey were all bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or dew.\n“It is dawn,” thought Pierre. “But that’s not what I want. I want to hear\nand understand my benefactor’s words.” Again he covered himself up with\nhis cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there. There\nwere only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts that someone was\nuttering or that he himself was formulating.\nAfterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that\nsomeone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of that\nday had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to think\nand express his thoughts like that when awake.\n“To endure war is the most difficult subordination of man’s freedom to\nthe law of God,” the voice had said. “Simplicity is submission to the will of\nGod; you cannot escape from Him. And they are simple. They do not talk,\nbut act. The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden. Man can be\nmaster of nothing while he fears death, but he who does not fear it\npossesses all. If there were no suffering, man would not know his"}, {"page": 1178, "text": "limitations, would not know himself. The hardest thing (Pierre went on\nthinking, or hearing, in his dream) is to be able in your soul to unite the\nmeaning of all. To unite all?” he asked himself. “No, not to unite. Thoughts\ncannot be united, but to harness all these thoughts together is what we\nneed! Yes, one must harness them, must harness them!” he repeated to\nhimself with inward rapture, feeling that these words and they alone\nexpressed what he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented\nhim.\n“Yes, one must harness, it is time to harness.”\n“Time to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your excellency!”\nsome voice was repeating. “We must harness, it is time to harness....”\nIt was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone straight\ninto Pierre’s face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the middle of which\nsoldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump while carts were\npassing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with repugnance, and closing his\neyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat. “No, I don’t want that, I don’t\nwant to see and understand that. I want to understand what was revealing\nitself to me in my dream. One second more and I should have understood it\nall! But what am I to do? Harness, but how can I harness everything?” and\nPierre felt with horror that the meaning of all he had seen and thought in the\ndream had been destroyed.\nThe groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an officer\nhad come with news that the French were already near Mozháysk and that\nour men were leaving it.\nPierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him, went on\nfoot through the town.\nThe troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind\nthem. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses, and\nthe streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts that were to\ntake some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and blows could be heard.\nPierre offered the use of his carriage, which had overtaken him, to a\nwounded general he knew, and drove with him to Moscow. On the way\nPierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of that of\nPrince Andrew."}, {"page": 1179, "text": "CHAPTER X\nOn the thirtieth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the gates of\nthe city he was met by Count Rostopchín’s adjutant.\n“We have been looking for you everywhere,” said the adjutant. “The\ncount wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at once on\na very important matter.”\nWithout going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow\ncommander in chief.\nCount Rostopchín had only that morning returned to town from his\nsummer villa at Sokólniki. The anteroom and reception room of his house\nwere full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders.\nVasílchikov and Plátov had already seen the count and explained to him that\nit was impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be\nsurrendered. Though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants,\nthe officials—the heads of the various government departments—knew that\nMoscow would soon be in the enemy’s hands, just as Count Rostopchín\nhimself knew it, and to escape personal responsibility they had all come to\nthe governor to ask how they were to deal with their various departments.\nAs Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came\nout of Rostopchín’s private room.\nIn answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a\ndespairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.\nWhile waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched the\nvarious officials, old and young, military and civilian, who were there. They\nall seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to a group of men, one of\nwhom he knew. After greeting Pierre they continued their conversation.\n“If they’re sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm,\nbut as things are now one can’t answer for anything.”"}, {"page": 1180, "text": "“But you see what he writes...” said another, pointing to a printed sheet\nhe held in his hand.\n“That’s another matter. That’s necessary for the people,” said the first.\n“What is it?” asked Pierre.\n“Oh, it’s a fresh broadsheet.”\nPierre took it and began reading.\nHis Serene Highness has passed through Mozháysk in order to join up\nwith the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position\nwhere the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty-eight guns with\nammunition have been sent him from here, and his Serene Highness says he\nwill defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in\nthe streets. Do not be upset, brothers, that the law courts are closed; things\nhave to be put in order, and we will deal with villains in our own way!\nWhen the time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise\nthe cry a day or two beforehand, but they are not wanted yet so I hold my\npeace. An ax will be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a three-pronged\nfork will be best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye.\nTomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of the Mother of God to\nthe wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will have some water\nblessed. That will help them to get well quicker. I, too, am well now: one of\nmy eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both.\n“But military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the town,”\nsaid Pierre, “and that the position...”\n“Well, of course! That’s what we were saying,” replied the first speaker.\n“And what does he mean by ‘One of my eyes was sore but now I am on\nthe lookout with both’?” asked Pierre.\n“The count had a sty,” replied the adjutant smiling, “and was very much\nupset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with\nhim. By the by, Count,” he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a smile,\n“we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess, your wife...”\n“I have heard nothing,” Pierre replied unconcernedly. “But what have\nyou heard?”\n“Oh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I heard.”\n“But what did you hear?”"}, {"page": 1181, "text": "“Well, they say,” continued the adjutant with the same smile, “that the\ncountess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad.

That’s a tradesman, that is to say, he’s the restaurant keeper,\nVereshchágin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the proclamation.”\n“Oh, so that is Vereshchágin!” said Pierre, looking at the firm, calm face\nof the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor.\n“That’s not he himself, that’s the father of the fellow who wrote the\nproclamation,” said the adjutant. “The young man is in prison and I expect\nit will go hard with him.”\nAn old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German wearing\na cross round his neck, approached the speaker.\n“It’s a complicated story, you know,” said the adjutant. “That\nproclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed of\nit. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Ivánovich here made\nthe inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly sixty-three\nhands. He asked one, ‘From whom did you get it?’ ‘From so-and-so.’ He\nwent to the next one. ‘From whom did you get it?’ and so on till he reached\nVereshchágin, a half educated tradesman, you know, ‘a pet of a trader,’”\nsaid the adjutant smiling. “They asked him, ‘Who gave it you?’ And the\npoint is that we knew whom he had it from. He could only have had it from\nthe Postmaster. But evidently they had come to some understanding. He\nreplied: ‘From no one; I made it up myself.’ They threatened and\nquestioned him, but he stuck to that: ‘I made it up myself.’ And so it was\nreported to the count, who sent for the man. ‘From whom did you get the\nproclamation?’ ‘I wrote it myself.’ Well, you know the count,” said the\nadjutant cheerfully, with a smile of pride, “he flared up dreadfully—and just\nthink of the fellow’s audacity, lying, and obstinacy!”\n“And the count wanted him to say it was from Klyucharëv? I\nunderstand!” said Pierre.\n“Not at all,” rejoined the adjutant in dismay. “Klyucharëv had his own\nsins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished. But\nthe point is that the count was much annoyed. ‘How could you have written"}, {"page": 1182, "text": "it yourself?’ said he, and he took up the Hamburg Gazette that was lying on\nthe table. ‘Here it is! You did not write it yourself but translated it, and\ntranslated it abominably, because you don’t even know French, you fool.’\nAnd what do you think? ‘No,’ said he, ‘I have not read any papers, I made it\nup myself.’ ‘If that’s so, you’re a traitor and I’ll have you tried, and you’ll\nbe hanged! Say from whom you had it.’ ‘I have seen no papers, I made it up\nmyself.’ And that was the end of it. The count had the father fetched, but the\nfellow stuck to it. He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I\nbelieve. Now the father has come to intercede for him. But he’s a good-for-\nnothing lad! You know that sort of tradesman’s son, a dandy and lady-killer.\nHe attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no\nmatch for him. That’s the sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop\nhere by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God\nAlmighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other.

He\nfound some scoundrel of a painter...”"}, {"page": 1183, "text": "CHAPTER XI\nIn the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the commander\nin chief.\nWhen he entered the private room Count Rostopchín, puckering his face,\nwas rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was saying\nsomething, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out.\n“Ah, how do you do, great warrior?” said Rostopchín as soon as the short\nman had left the room. “We have heard of your prowess. But that’s not the\npoint. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?” he\nwent on severely, as though there were something wrong about it which he\nnevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. “I am well\ninformed, my friend, but I am aware that there are Masons and I hope that\nyou are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to ruin\nRussia.”\n“Yes, I am a Mason,” Pierre replied.\n“There, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that Messrs. Speránski and\nMagnítski have been deported to their proper place. Mr. Klyucharëv has\nbeen treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea of\nbuilding up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of their\nfatherland. You can understand that there are reasons for this and that I\ncould not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a harmful person. It\nhas now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his\nremoval from town, and that you have even accepted papers from him for\nsafe custody. I like you and don’t wish you any harm and—as you are only\nhalf my age—I advise you, as a father would, to cease all communication\nwith men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as possible.”\n“But what did Klyucharëv do wrong, Count?” asked Pierre.\n“That is for me to know, but not for you to ask,” shouted Rostopchín."}, {"page": 1184, "text": "“If he is accused of circulating Napoleon’s proclamation it is not proved\nthat he did so,” said Pierre without looking at Rostopchín, “and\nVereshchágin...”\n“There we are!” Rostopchín shouted at Pierre louder than before,\nfrowning suddenly. “Vereshchágin is a renegade and a traitor who will be\npunished as he deserves,” said he with the vindictive heat with which\npeople speak when recalling an insult. “But I did not summon you to\ndiscuss my actions, but to give you advice—or an order if you prefer it. I\nbeg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such men\nas Klyucharëv. And I will knock the nonsense out of anybody”—but\nprobably realizing that he was shouting at Bezúkhov who so far was not\nguilty of anything, he added, taking Pierre’s hand in a friendly manner, “We\nare on the eve of a public disaster and I haven’t time to be polite to\neverybody who has business with me. My head is sometimes in a whirl.\nWell, mon cher, what are you doing personally?”\n“Why, nothing,” answered Pierre without raising his eyes or changing the\nthoughtful expression of his face.\nThe count frowned.\n“A word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon as you can, that’s\nall I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears to hear. Good-by, my dear\nfellow. Oh, by the by!” he shouted through the doorway after Pierre, “is it\ntrue that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers of the\nSociety of Jesus?”\nPierre did not answer and left Rostopchín’s room more sullen and angry\nthan he had ever before shown himself.\nWhen he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight people\nhad come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, the colonel\nof his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners. They\nall had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. Pierre did not\nunderstand and was not interested in any of these questions and only\nanswered them in order to get rid of these people. When left alone at last he\nopened and read his wife’s letter.\n“They, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old man...\nSimplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary... the meaning of\nall... one must harness... my wife is getting married...

Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to see them,\nwent to the back porch and out through the gate.\nFrom that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of\nBezúkhov’s household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre again or\nknew where he was."}, {"page": 1186, "text": "CHAPTER XII\nThe Rostóvs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is, till\nthe eve of the enemy’s entry into the city.\nAfter Pétya had joined Obolénski’s regiment of Cossacks and left for\nBélaya Tsérkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized\nwith terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war, had both gone\nfrom under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or both of them might\nbe killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, struck her that\nsummer for the first time with cruel clearness. She tried to get Nicholas\nback and wished to go herself to join Pétya, or to get him an appointment\nsomewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved possible. Pétya could\nnot return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another\nregiment on active service. Nicholas was somewhere with the army and had\nnot sent a word since his last letter, in which he had given a detailed\naccount of his meeting with Princess Mary. The countess did not sleep at\nnight, or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead.\nAfter many consultations and conversations, the count at last devised means\nto tranquillize her. He got Pétya transferred from Obolénski’s regiment to\nBezúkhov’s, which was in training near Moscow. Though Pétya would\nremain in the service, this transfer would give the countess the consolation\nof seeing at least one of her sons under her wing, and she hoped to arrange\nmatters for her Pétya so as not to let him go again, but always get him\nappointed to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle. As\nlong as Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved\nher first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself\nfor it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons,\nwas always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to\neverybody, that snub-nosed Pétya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy\ncheeks where soft down was just beginning to show—when he was thrown\namid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting somewhere about"}, {"page": 1187, "text": "something and apparently finding pleasure in it—then his mother thought\nshe loved him more, much more, than all her other children. The nearer the\ntime came for Pétya to return, the more uneasy grew the countess. She\nbegan to think she would never live to see such happiness. The presence of\nSónya, of her beloved Natásha, or even of her husband irritated her. “What\ndo I want with them? I want no one but Pétya,” she thought.\nAt the end of August the Rostóvs received another letter from Nicholas.\nHe wrote from the province of Vorónezh where he had been sent to procure\nremounts, but that letter did not set the countess at ease. Knowing that one\nson was out of danger she became the more anxious about Pétya.\nThough by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rostóvs’ acquaintances\nhad left Moscow, and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to\nget away as quickly as possible, she would not hear of leaving before her\ntreasure, her adored Pétya, returned. On the twenty-eighth of August he\narrived. The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did\nnot please the sixteen-year-old officer. Though she concealed from him her\nintention of keeping him under her wing, Pétya guessed her designs, and\ninstinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion when with her—\nmight “become womanish” as he termed it to himself—he treated her\ncoldly, avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached himself\nexclusively to Natásha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly\ntenderness, almost lover-like.\nOwing to the count’s customary carelessness nothing was ready for their\ndeparture by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to come\nfrom their Ryazán and Moscow estates to remove their household\nbelongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.\nFrom the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle and\ncommotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodinó were\nbrought in by the Dorogomílov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow,\nand thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions out\nby the other gates. In spite of Rostopchín’s broadsheets, or because of them\nor independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory rumors were\ncurrent in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed to leave the\ncity, others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the\nchurches and everybody was to be ordered to leave. Some said there had\nbeen another battle after Borodinó at which the French had been routed,"}, {"page": 1188, "text": "while others on the contrary reported that the Russian army had been\ndestroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia which, preceded by the\nclergy, would go to the Three Hills; others whispered that Augustin had\nbeen forbidden to leave, that traitors had been seized, that the peasants were\nrioting and robbing people on their way from Moscow, and so on. But all\nthis was only talk; in reality (though the Council of Filí, at which it was\ndecided to abandon Moscow, had not yet been held) both those who went\naway and those who remained behind felt, though they did not show it, that\nMoscow would certainly be abandoned, and that they ought to get away as\nquickly as possible and save their belongings. It was felt that everything\nwould suddenly break up and change, but up to the first of September\nnothing had done so. As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that\nhe must die immediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap\nthat is awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life,\nthough it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the conditions\nof life to which its people were accustomed to submit would be completely\nupset.\nDuring the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole\nRostóv family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the family,\nCount Ilyá Rostóv, continually drove about the city collecting the current\nrumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders at home about\nthe preparations for their departure.\nThe countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied with\neverything, was constantly in pursuit of Pétya who was always running\naway from her, and was jealous of Natásha with whom he spent all his time.\nSónya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting things packed.\nBut of late Sónya had been particularly sad and silent. Nicholas’ letter in\nwhich he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited, in her presence, joyous\ncomments from the countess, who saw an intervention of Providence in this\nmeeting of the princess and Nicholas.\n“I was never pleased at Bolkónski’s engagement to Natásha,” said the\ncountess, “but I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had a\npresentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!”\nSónya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of retrieving the\nRostóvs’ affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that the\nprincess was a good match. It was very bitter for her. But despite her grief,"}, {"page": 1189, "text": "or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the difficult work of\ndirecting the storing and packing of their things and was busy for whole\ndays. The count and countess turned to her when they had any orders to\ngive. Pétya and Natásha on the contrary, far from helping their parents,\nwere generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone. Almost all day long\nthe house resounded with their running feet, their cries, and their\nspontaneous laughter. They laughed and were gay not because there was\nany reason to laugh, but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and\nso everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them.\nPétya was in high spirits because having left home a boy he had returned\n(as everybody told him) a fine young man, because he was at home,\nbecause he had left Bélaya Tsérkov where there was no hope of soon taking\npart in a battle and had come to Moscow where there was to be fighting in a\nfew days, and chiefly because Natásha, whose lead he always followed, was\nin high spirits. Natásha was gay because she had been sad too long and now\nnothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness, and because she was\nfeeling well. She was also happy because she had someone to adore her: the\nadoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to\nmake them run freely—and Pétya adored her. Above all, they were gay\nbecause there was a war near Moscow, there would be fighting at the town\ngates, arms were being given out, everybody was escaping—going away\nsomewhere, and in general something extraordinary was happening, and\nthat is always exciting, especially to the young."}, {"page": 1190, "text": "CHAPTER XIII\nOn Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the Rostóvs’ house\nseemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the furniture was being\ncarried out or moved about, and the mirrors and pictures had been taken\ndown. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay, wrapping paper, and ropes\nwere scattered about. The peasants and house serfs carrying out the things\nwere treading heavily on the parquet floors. The yard was crowded with\npeasant carts, some loaded high and already corded up, others still empty.\nThe voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who\nhad come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in the\nyard and in the house. The count had been out since morning. The countess\nhad a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was lying down\nin the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head. Pétya was not\nat home, he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a\ntransfer from the militia to the active army. Sónya was in the ballroom\nlooking after the packing of the glass and china. Natásha was sitting on the\nfloor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons, and scarves strewn all\nabout her, gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball\ndress (already out of fashion) which she had worn at her first Petersburg\nball.\nNatásha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy,\nand several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart was\nnot in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything except\nwith all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood beside Sónya\nwhile the china was being packed and tried to help, but soon gave it up and\nwent to her room to pack her own things. At first she found it amusing to\ngive away dresses and ribbons to the maids, but when that was done and\nwhat was left had still to be packed, she found it dull.\n“Dunyásha, you pack! You will, won’t you, dear?” And when Dunyásha\nwillingly promised to do it all for her, Natásha sat down on the floor, took"}, {"page": 1191, "text": "her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to\nhave occupied her thoughts now. She was roused from her reverie by the\ntalk of the maids in the next room (which was theirs) and by the sound of\ntheir hurried footsteps going to the back porch. Natásha got up and looked\nout of the window. An enormously long row of carts full of wounded men\nhad stopped in the street.\nThe housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen,\npostilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.\nNatásha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding\nan end of it in each hand, went out into the street.\nThe former housekeeper, old Mávra Kuzmínichna, had stepped out of the\ncrowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats,\nand was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside. Natásha moved a\nfew steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her handkerchief, and\nlistened to what the housekeeper was saying.\n“Then you have nobody in Moscow?” she was saying. “You would be\nmore comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the family\nare leaving.”\n“I don’t know if it would be allowed,” replied the officer in a weak voice.\n“Here is our commanding officer... ask him,” and he pointed to a stout\nmajor who was walking back along the street past the row of carts.\nNatásha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer\nand at once went to meet the major.\n“May the wounded men stay in our house?” she asked.\nThe major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.\n“Which one do you want, Ma’am’selle?” said he, screwing up his eyes\nand smiling.\nNatásha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole manner\nwere so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her handkerchief,\nthat the major ceased smiling and after some reflection—as if considering\nin how far the thing was possible—replied in the affirmative.\n“Oh yes, why not? They may,” he said.\nWith a slight inclination of her head, Natásha stepped back quickly to\nMávra Kuzmínichna, who stood talking compassionately to the officer."}, {"page": 1192, "text": "“They may. He says they may!” whispered Natásha.\nThe cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rostóvs’ yard, and\ndozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk\nto turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in\nPovarskáya Street. Natásha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new\npeople outside the ordinary routine of her life. She and Mávra Kuzmínichna\ntried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their yard.\n“Your Papa must be told, though,” said Mávra Kuzmínichna.\n“Never mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move\ninto the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house.”\n“There now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we\nput them into the wing, the men’s room, or the nurse’s room, we must ask\npermission.”\n“Well, I’ll ask.”\nNatásha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door\ninto the sitting room, where there was a smell of vinegar and Hoffman’s\ndrops.\n“Are you asleep, Mamma?”\n“Oh, what sleep—?” said the countess, waking up just as she was\ndropping into a doze.\n“Mamma darling!” said Natásha, kneeling by her mother and bringing\nher face close to her mother’s, “I am sorry, forgive me, I’ll never do it\nagain; I woke you up! Mávra Kuzmínichna has sent me: they have brought\nsome wounded here—officers. Will you let them come? They have nowhere\nto go. I knew you’d let them come!” she said quickly all in one breath.\n“What officers? Whom have they brought? I don’t understand anything\nabout it,” said the countess.\nNatásha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.\n“I knew you’d give permission... so I’ll tell them,” and, having kissed her\nmother, Natásha got up and went to the door.\nIn the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.\n“We’ve stayed too long!” said the count with involuntary vexation. “The\nClub is closed and the police are leaving.”"}, {"page": 1193, "text": "“Papa, is it all right—I’ve invited some of the wounded into the house?”\nsaid Natásha.\n“Of course it is,” he answered absently. “That’s not the point. I beg you\nnot to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and tomorrow we must go,\ngo, go!...”\nAnd the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants.\nAt dinner Pétya having returned home told them the news he had heard.\nHe said the people had been getting arms in the Krémlin, and that though\nRostopchín’s broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three\ndays in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone to\ngo armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big battle\nthere.\nThe countess looked with timid horror at her son’s eager, excited face as\nhe said this. She realized that if she said a word about his not going to the\nbattle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement) he\nwould say something about men, honor, and the fatherland—something\nsenseless, masculine, and obstinate which there would be no contradicting,\nand her plans would be spoiled; and so, hoping to arrange to leave before\nthen and take Pétya with her as their protector and defender, she did not\nanswer him, but after dinner called the count aside and implored him with\ntears to take her away quickly, that very night if possible. With a woman’s\ninvoluntary loving cunning she, who till then had not shown any alarm, said\nthat she would die of fright if they did not leave that very night. Without\nany pretense she was now afraid of everything."}, {"page": 1194, "text": "CHAPTER XIV\nMadame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the\ncountess’ fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit dealer’s in\nMyasnítski Street. When returning by that street she had been unable to\npass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop. She had taken\na cab and driven home by a side street and the cabman had told her that the\npeople were breaking open the barrels at the drink store, having received\norders to do so.\nAfter dinner the whole Rostóv household set to work with enthusiastic\nhaste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure. The old\ncount, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the yard to the house and\nback again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying people, and\nflurrying them still more. Pétya directed things in the yard. Sónya, owing to\nthe count’s contradictory orders, lost her head and did not know what to do.\nThe servants ran noisily about the house and yard, shouting and disputing.\nNatásha, with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work\ntoo. At first her intervention in the business of packing was received\nskeptically. Everybody expected some prank from her and did not wish to\nobey her; but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience, grew\nangry and nearly cried because they did not heed her, and at last succeeded\nin making them believe her. Her first exploit, which cost her immense effort\nand established her authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had\nvaluable Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Natásha\nset to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost full\nup with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much china\nstanding on the tables, and still more was being brought in from the\nstoreroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it.\n“Sónya, wait a bit—we’ll pack everything into these,” said Natásha.\n“You can’t, Miss, we have tried to,” said the butler’s assistant."}, {"page": 1195, "text": "“No, wait a minute, please.”\nAnd Natásha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates\nwrapped in paper.\n“The dishes must go in here among the carpets,” said she.\n“Why, it’s a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases,” said\nthe butler’s assistant.\n“Oh, wait, please!” And Natásha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the\nthings. “These aren’t needed,” said she, putting aside some plates of Kiev\nware. “These—yes, these must go among the carpets,” she said, referring to\nthe Saxony china dishes.\n“Don’t, Natásha! Leave it alone! We’ll get it all packed,” urged Sónya\nreproachfully.\n“What a young lady she is!” remarked the major-domo.\nBut Natásha would not give in. She turned everything out and began\nquickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and\nunnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had been\ntaken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned out that\nwhen the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected, the\nvaluable ones really did all go into the two cases. Only the lid of the case\ncontaining the carpets would not shut down. A few more things might have\nbeen taken out, but Natásha insisted on having her own way. She packed,\nrepacked, pressed, made the butler’s assistant and Pétya—whom she had\ndrawn into the business of packing—press on the lid, and made desperate\nefforts herself.\n“That’s enough, Natásha,” said Sónya. “I see you were right, but just take\nout the top one.”\n“I won’t!” cried Natásha, with one hand holding back the hair that hung\nover her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down the carpets.\n“Now press, Pétya! Press, Vasílich, press hard!” she cried.\nThe carpets yielded and the lid closed; Natásha, clapping her hands,\nscreamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only lasted a\nmoment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her\ncompletely. The count was not angry even when they told him that Natásha\nhad countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came to her to ask\nwhether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it might be corded up."}, {"page": 1196, "text": "Thanks to Natásha’s directions the work now went on expeditiously,\nunnecessary things were left, and the most valuable packed as compactly as\npossible.\nBut hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not get\neverything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the count, having put\noff their departure till next morning, went to bed.\nSónya and Natásha slept in the sitting room without undressing.\nThat night another wounded man was driven down the Povarskáya, and\nMávra Kuzmínichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into\nthe Rostóvs’ yard. Mávra Kuzmínichna concluded that he was a very\nimportant man. He was being conveyed in a calèche with a raised hood, and\nwas quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the driver sat a venerable\nold attendant. A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a cart.\n“Please come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house\nwill be empty,” said the old woman to the old attendant.\n“Well, perhaps,” said he with a sigh. “We don’t expect to get him home\nalive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but it’s a long way from\nhere, and there’s nobody living in it.”\n“Do us the honor to come in, there’s plenty of everything in the master’s\nhouse. Come in,” said Mávra Kuzmínichna. “Is he very ill?” she asked.\nThe attendant made a hopeless gesture.\n“We don’t expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor.”\nAnd the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.\n“All right!” said the doctor.\nThe old servant returned to the calèche, looked into it, shook his head\ndisconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and stopped beside\nMávra Kuzmínichna.\n“O, Lord Jesus Christ!” she murmured.\nShe invited them to take the wounded man into the house.\n“The masters won’t object...” she said.\nBut they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took him\ninto the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame Schoss’.\nThis wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolkónski."}, {"page": 1197, "text": "CHAPTER XV\nMoscow’s last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday.\nThe church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on\nSundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.\nOnly two things indicated the social condition of Moscow—the rabble,\nthat is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An enormous crowd\nof factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with whom some officials,\nseminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone early that morning to the\nThree Hills. Having waited there for Rostopchín who did not turn up, they\nbecame convinced that Moscow would be surrendered, and then dispersed\nall about the town to the public houses and cookshops. Prices too that day\nindicated the state of affairs. The price of weapons, of gold, of carts and\nhorses, kept rising, but the value of paper money and city articles kept\nfalling, so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable\ngoods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment a half of what they carted,\nwhile peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each, and furniture,\nmirrors, and bronzes were being given away for nothing.\nIn the Rostóvs’ staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former\nconditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs the only\nindication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the\nnight, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their possessions, the\nthirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many\npeople envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered\nenormous sums of money for them. Not only were huge sums offered for\nthe horses and carts, but on the previous evening and early in the morning\nof the first of September, orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers\ncame to the Rostóvs’ and wounded men dragged themselves there from the\nRostóvs’ and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated,\nentreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow. The major-\ndomo to whom these entreaties were addressed, though he was sorry for the"}, {"page": 1198, "text": "wounded, resolutely refused, saying that he dare not even mention the\nmatter to the count. Pity these wounded men as one might, it was evident\nthat if they were given one cart there would be no reason to refuse another,\nor all the carts and one’s own carriages as well. Thirty carts could not save\nall the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard\noneself and one’s own family. So thought the major-domo on his master’s\nbehalf.\nOn waking up that morning Count Ilyá Rostóv left his bedroom softly, so\nas not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning, and\ncame out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In the yard stood the\ncarts ready corded. The carriages were at the front porch. The major-domo\nstood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer\nwith a bandaged arm. On seeing the count the major-domo made a\nsignificant and stern gesture to them both to go away.\n“Well, Vasílich, is everything ready?” asked the count, and stroking his\nbald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the orderly and\nnodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)\n“We can harness at once, your excellency.”\n“Well, that’s right. As soon as the countess wakes we’ll be off, God\nwilling! What is it, gentlemen?” he added, turning to the officer. “Are you\nstaying in my house?”\nThe officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.\n“Count, be so good as to allow me... for God’s sake, to get into some\ncorner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I shall be all\nright on a loaded cart....”\nBefore the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same\nrequest on behalf of his master.\n“Oh, yes, yes, yes!” said the count hastily. “I shall be very pleased, very\npleased. Vasílich, you’ll see to it. Just unload one or two carts. Well, what of\nit... do what’s necessary...” said the count, muttering some indefinite order.\nBut at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer’s\nface had already sealed the order.

On\ninquiry, the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because her\ntrunk had been taken down from its cart, and all the loads were being\nuncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for wounded\nmen whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered that they\nshould take with them. The countess sent for her husband.\n“What is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded.”\n“You know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer came\nto me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are things that\ncan be bought but think what being left behind means to them!...

You know, I think, my dear... let them be taken... where’s the\nhurry?”\nThe count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money\nmatters. The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of\nsomething detrimental to the children’s interests, such as the building of a\nnew gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a private theater or an\norchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in\nthat timid tone and considered it her duty to do so.\nShe assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband:\n“Listen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting\nnothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all our—all the\nchildren’s property! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand\nrubles’ worth of things in the house. I don’t consent, my dear, I don’t! Do as\nyou please!

He looked\nattentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took out\na clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.\nFrom the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the\ndrawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of Natásha\nand Sónya, and hastened to inquire after “Mamma’s” health.\n“Health, at a time like this?” said the count. “Come, tell us the news! Is\nthe army retreating or will there be another battle?”\n“God Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa,” said\nBerg. “The army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so to\nsay, have now assembled in council. No one knows what is coming. But in\ngeneral I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly antique valor\nof the Russian army, which they—which it” (he corrected himself) “has\nshown or displayed in the battle of the twenty-sixth—there are no words\nworthy to do it justice! I tell you, Papa” (he smote himself on the breast as a\ngeneral he had heard speaking had done, but Berg did it a trifle late for he\nshould have struck his breast at the words “Russian army”), “I tell you\nfrankly that we, the commanders, far from having to urge the men on or"}, {"page": 1202, "text": "anything of that kind, could hardly restrain those... those... yes, those\nexploits of antique valor,” he went on rapidly. “General Barclay de Tolly\nrisked his life everywhere at the head of the troops, I can assure you. Our\ncorps was stationed on a hillside. You can imagine!”\nAnd Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had heard\nthose days. Natásha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him, as\nif she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question.\n“Altogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors\ncannot be imagined or adequately praised!” said Berg, glancing round at\nNatásha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her intent look with\na smile. “‘Russia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of her sons!’ Isn’t\nit so, Papa?” said he.\nJust then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and\ndissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her hand, asked\nabout her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to express\nsympathy, remained standing beside her.\n“Yes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for\nevery Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get\naway....”\n“I can’t think what the servants are about,” said the countess, turning to\nher husband. “I have just been told that nothing is ready yet.

To the devil, the devil, the devil...” cried\nthe old count. “My head’s in a whirl!”\nAnd he left the room. The countess began to cry.\n“Yes, Mamma!

Are\nwe despicable Germans?”\nHer throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and\nletting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed headlong\nup the stairs.\nBerg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful\nattention of a relative.

Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...” asked Natásha. “We will still\ntake all the most necessary things.”\nThe count nodded affirmatively, and Natásha, at the rapid pace at which\nshe used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the\nanteroom and downstairs into the yard.\nThe servants gathered round Natásha, but could not believe the strange\norder she brought them until the count himself, in his wife’s name,"}, {"page": 1205, "text": "confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the\ntrunks to the storerooms.

The\nwounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but\nhappy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread to\nthe neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the\nRostóvs’ yard.

It seemed not to matter whether all or only\nhalf the things were left behind. Cases full of china, bronzes, pictures, and\nmirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the\nyard, and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of\nunloading this or that and letting the wounded have another and yet another\ncart.\n“We can take four more men,” said the steward. “They can have my trap,\nor else what is to become of them?”\n“Let them have my wardrobe cart,” said the countess. “Dunyásha can go\nwith me in the carriage.”\nThey unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a\nhouse two doors off.

This is how it\nhappened.\nWhen he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his\ninterview with Count Rostopchín, he could not for some time make out\nwhere he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that\namong others awaiting him in his reception room there was a Frenchman\nwho had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess Hélène, he felt\nsuddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which he\nwas apt to succumb. He felt that everything was now at an end, all was in\nconfusion and crumbling to pieces, that nobody was right or wrong, the\nfuture held nothing, and there was no escape from this position. Smiling\nunnaturally and muttering to himself, he first sat down on the sofa in an\nattitude of despair, then rose, went to the door of the reception room and\npeeped through the crack, returned flourishing his arms, and took up a\nbook. His major-domo came in a second time to say that the Frenchman\nwho had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if\nonly for a minute, and that someone from Bazdéev’s widow had called to\nask Pierre to take charge of her husband’s books, as she herself was leaving\nfor the country.\n“Oh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say I will\ncome directly,” Pierre replied to the major-domo.\nBut as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat which\nwas lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door. There\nwas no one in the passage. He went along the whole length of this passage\nto the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his forehead with both hands, went\ndown as far as the first landing. The hall porter was standing at the front\ndoor. From the landing where Pierre stood there was a second staircase\nleading to the back entrance. He went down that staircase and out into the"}, {"page": 1213, "text": "yard. No one had seen him. But there were some carriages waiting, and as\nsoon as Pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter\nnoticed him and raised their caps to him. When he felt he was being looked\nat he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in order not to\nbe seen: he hung his head and quickening his pace went down the street.\nOf all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph Bazdéev’s\nbooks and papers appeared to him the most necessary.\nHe hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the Patriarch’s\nPonds, where the widow Bazdéev’s house was.\nContinually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were\nmaking their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing his bulky\nbody so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle, Pierre,\nexperiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school, began to talk\nto his driver.\nThe man told him that arms were being distributed today at the Krémlin\nand that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the Three Hills gates\nand a great battle would be fought there.\nHaving reached the Patriarch’s Ponds Pierre found the Bazdéevs’ house,\nwhere he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the gate.\nGerásim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at Torzhók five\nyears before with Joseph Bazdéev, came out in answer to his knock.\n“At home?” asked Pierre.\n“Owing to the present state of things Sophia Danílovna has gone to the\nTorzhók estate with the children, your excellency.”\n“I will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,” said\nPierre.\n“Be so good as to step in.

The room, dusty and untouched\nsince the death of Joseph Bazdéev was now even gloomier.\nGerásim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe. Pierre\nwent round the study, approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts\nwere kept, and took out what had once been one of the most important, the\nholy of holies of the order. This was the authentic Scotch Acts with\nBazdéev’s notes and explanations. He sat down at the dusty writing table,\nand, having laid the manuscripts before him, opened them out, closed them,\nfinally pushed them away, and resting his head on his hand sank into\nmeditation.\nGerásim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre\nalways sitting in the same attitude.\nMore than two hours passed and Gerásim took the liberty of making a\nslight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did not hear him.\n“Is the cabman to be discharged, your honor?”\n“Oh yes!” said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. “Look here,”\nhe added, taking Gerásim by a button of his coat and looking down at the\nold man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, “I say, do you know that\nthere is going to be a battle tomorrow?”\n“We heard so,” replied the man.\n“I beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you.”\n“Yes, your excellency,” replied Gerásim. “Will you have something to\neat?”\n“No, but I want something else.

At daybreak, however, those nearing the town at\nthe Dorogomílov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding\nand hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the opposite side and blocking\nthe streets and alleys, while endless masses of troops were bearing down on\nthem from behind, and an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them.\nThey all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and to the fords and the\nboats. Kutúzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of\nMoscow.\nBy ten o’clock in the morning of the second of September, only the rear\nguard remained in the Dorogomílov suburb, where they had ample room.\nThe main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.\nAt that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September,\nNapoleon was standing among his troops on the Poklónny Hill looking at\nthe panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August to the\nsecond of September, that is from the battle of Borodinó to the entry of the\nFrench into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating, memorable week,\nthere had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a\nsurprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat than in spring, when\neverything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes\nsmart, when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling the\naromatic autumn air, when even the nights are warm, and when in those\ndark warm nights, golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling\nfrom the sky.\nAt ten in the morning of the second of September this weather still held."}, {"page": 1217, "text": "The brightness of the morning was magical.

This city was evidently living with the full force of its\nown life. By the indefinite signs which, even at a distance, distinguish a\nliving body from a dead one, Napoleon from the Poklónny Hill perceived\nthe throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the breathing of that great\nand beautiful body.\nEvery Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every\nforeigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the mother\ncity, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.\n“Cette ville asiatique aux innombrables églises, Moscou la sainte. La\nvoilà donc enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il était temps,” * said he, and\ndismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and\nsummoned Lelorgne d’Ideville, the interpreter.\n* “That Asiatic city of the innumerable churches, holy Moscow! Here it is then\nat last, that famous city. It was high time.”\n“A town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,”\nthought he (he had said so to Túchkov at Smolénsk). From that point of\nview he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed\nstrange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable, had\nat last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and\nnow at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance of possessing it\nagitated and awed him.\n“But could it be otherwise?” he thought. “Here is this capital at my feet.\nWhere is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange, beautiful,\nand majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In what light must I\nappear to them!” thought he, thinking of his troops. “Here she is, the reward\nfor all those fainthearted men,” he reflected, glancing at those near him and\nat the troops who were approaching and forming up. “One word from me,\none movement of my hand, and that ancient capital of the Tsars would"}, {"page": 1218, "text": "perish.

But I\nshall spare her. On the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism I\nwill inscribe great words of justice and mercy.... It is just this which\nAlexander will feel most painfully, I know him.” (It seemed to Napoleon\nthat the chief import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle\nbetween himself and Alexander.) “From the height of the Krémlin—yes,\nthere is the Krémlin, yes—I will give them just laws; I will teach them the\nmeaning of true civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember\ntheir conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not, and do\nnot, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false policy of their\ncourt; that I love and respect Alexander and that in Moscow I will accept\nterms of peace worthy of myself and of my people. I do not wish to utilize\nthe fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch. ‘Boyars,’ I will say to\nthem, ‘I do not desire war, I desire the peace and welfare of all my\nsubjects.’ However, I know their presence will inspire me, and I shall speak\nto them as I always do: clearly, impressively, and majestically.

Yes, there she lies.”\n“Qu’on m’amène les boyars,” * said he to his suite.\n* “Bring the boyars to me.”\nA general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the boyars.\nTwo hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the\nsame place on the Poklónny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to the\nboyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That speech was\nfull of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.\nHe was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to\nadopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for assemblies\nat the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and his own would\nmingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who would win the hearts of\nthe people. Having learned that there were many charitable institutions in\nMoscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors on them all.

But one has only to\nobserve that hive to realize that there is no longer any life in it. The bees do\nnot fly in the same way, the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are\nnot the same. To the beekeeper’s tap on the wall of the sick hive, instead of\nthe former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with\ntheir abdomens threateningly compressed, and producing by the rapid\nvibration of their wings an aerial living sound, the only reply is a\ndisconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive. From the\nalighting board, instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and\nvenom, and the warm whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness\nand decay mingling with the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels\nsounding the alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in defense\nof the hive. There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing\nactivity, like the sound of boiling water, but diverse discordant sounds of\ndisorder.

In another corner two old bees are languidly fighting, or cleaning\nthemselves, or feeding one another, without themselves knowing whether\nthey do it with friendly or hostile intent. In a third place a crowd of bees,\ncrushing one another, attack some victim and fight and smother it, and the\nvictim, enfeebled or killed, drops from above slowly and lightly as a\nfeather, among the heap of corpses. The keeper opens the two center\npartitions to examine the brood cells. In place of the former close dark\ncircles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the\nhigh mystery of generation, he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy\nshells of bees.

The publican, taking advantage of the\nincreased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.\nThe tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his bare\narm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention to himself.\nIt was around him that the people chiefly crowded, expecting answers from\nhim to the questions that occupied all their minds.\n“He must keep order, keep the law, that’s what the government is there\nfor. Am I not right, good Christians?” said the tall youth, with a scarcely\nperceptible smile. “He thinks there’s no government! How can one do\nwithout government? Or else there would be plenty who’d rob us.”\n“Why talk nonsense?” rejoined voices in the crowd. “Will they give up\nMoscow like this? They told you that for fun, and you believed it!

The tall\nlad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had understood the\nlast part. In particular, the words “I will come back to dinner,” evidently\ndispleased both reader and audience. The people’s minds were tuned to a\nhigh pitch and this was too simple and needlessly comprehensible—it was\nwhat any one of them might have said and therefore was what an ukáse\nemanating from the highest authority should not say.\nThey all stood despondent and silent.

Do they think we’re dogs?” voices in the crowd were heard saying\nmore and more frequently."}, {"page": 1235, "text": "CHAPTER XXIV\nOn the evening of the first of September, after his interview with\nKutúzov, Count Rostopchín had returned to Moscow mortified and\noffended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war, and\nbecause Kutúzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the\ndefense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the\ncamp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as\nnot merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters.\nDistressed, offended, and surprised by all this, Rostopchín had returned to\nMoscow. After supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing, and was\nawakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from\nKutúzov. This letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the\ntroops through the town, as the army was retreating to the Ryazán road\nbeyond Moscow. This was not news to Rostopchín. He had known that\nMoscow would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous\nday with Kutúzov on the Poklónny Hill but ever since the battle of\nBorodinó, for all the generals who came to Moscow after that battle had\nsaid unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle, and since\nthen the government property had been removed every night, and half the\ninhabitants had left the city with Rostopchín’s own permission. Yet all the\nsame this information astonished and irritated the count, coming as it did in\nthe form of a simple note with an order from Kutúzov, and received at\nnight, breaking in on his beauty sleep.\nWhen later on in his memoirs Count Rostopchín explained his actions at\nthis time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important\nconsiderations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the\ndeparture of the inhabitants. If one accepts this twofold aim all\nRostopchín’s actions appear irreproachable. “Why were the holy relics, the\narms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed? Why were\nthousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that Moscow would not be"}, {"page": 1236, "text": "given up—and thereby ruined?” “To preserve the tranquillity of the city,”\nexplains Count Rostopchín. “Why were bundles of useless papers from the\ngovernment offices, and Leppich’s balloon and other articles removed?”\n“To leave the town empty,” explains Count Rostopchín. One need only\nadmit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a\njustification.\nAll the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for\npublic tranquillity.\nOn what, then, was Count Rostopchín’s fear for the tranquillity of\nMoscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any\nprobability of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and\nthe retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause the masses to\nriot?\nNeither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an\ninsurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than ten\nthousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of September,\nand except for a mob in the governor’s courtyard, assembled there at his\nbidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would have been even\nless reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle of\nBorodinó, when the surrender of Moscow became certain or at least\nprobable, Rostopchín instead of exciting the people by distributing arms\nand broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the holy relics, the\ngunpowder, munitions, and money, and had told the population plainly that\nthe town would be abandoned.\nRostopchín, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and\nimpulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles\nand had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be\nguiding. Ever since the enemy’s entry into Smolénsk he had in imagination\nbeen playing the role of director of the popular feeling of “the heart of\nRussia.” Not only did it seem to him (as to all administrators) that he\ncontrolled the external actions of Moscow’s inhabitants, but he also thought\nhe controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters,\nwritten in a coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do\nnot understand from those in authority. Rostopchín was so pleased with the\nfine role of leader of popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the\nnecessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any"}, {"page": 1237, "text": "heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away\nfrom under his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do. Though\nhe knew it was coming, he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly\nbelieve that Moscow would be abandoned, and did not prepare for it. The\ninhabitants left against his wishes. If the government offices were removed,\nthis was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count yielded\nreluctantly. He was absorbed in the role he had created for himself. As is\noften the case with those gifted with an ardent imagination, though he had\nlong known that Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his\nintellect, he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally\nto this new position of affairs.\nAll his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful and\nhad any effect on the people is another question) had been simply directed\ntoward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic hatred of the\nFrench.\nBut when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing\nhatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not even\npossible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when self-confidence\nwas of no avail in relation to the one question before Moscow, when the\nwhole population streamed out of Moscow as one man, abandoning their\nbelongings and proving by that negative action all the depth of their\nnational feeling, then the role chosen by Rostopchín suddenly appeared\nsenseless. He unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous, weak, and alone, with no\nground to stand on.\nWhen, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory note\nfrom Kutúzov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself to blame.\nAll that he had been specially put in charge of, the state property which he\nshould have removed, was still in Moscow and it was no longer possible to\ntake the whole of it away.\n“Who is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?” he\nruminated. “Not I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow firmly\nin hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains! Traitors!” he\nthought, without clearly defining who the villains and traitors were, but\nfeeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever they might be who were\nto blame for the false and ridiculous position in which he found himself."}, {"page": 1238, "text": "All that night Count Rostopchín issued orders, for which people came to\nhim from all parts of Moscow.

From the Consistory, from the Senate, from the University,\nfrom the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent... asking for\ninformation.... What are your orders about the Fire Brigade? From the\ngovernor of the prison... from the superintendent of the lunatic asylum...”\nAll night long such announcements were continually being received by the\ncount.\nTo all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that\norders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair, carefully\nprepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that that\nsomebody would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might\nhappen.\n“Oh, tell that blockhead,” he said in reply to the question from the\nRegistrar’s Department, “that he should remain to guard his documents.\nNow why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade?

Let them go away, that’s all.... And let the lunatics out\ninto the town. When lunatics command our armies God evidently means\nthese other madmen to be free.”\nIn reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count Rostopchín\nshouted angrily at the governor:\n“Do you expect me to give you two battalions—which we have not got—\nfor a convoy? Release them, that’s all about it!”\n“Your excellency, there are some political prisoners, Meshkóv,\nVereshchágin...”\n“Vereshchágin!

Those who were able to get away were going of their own\naccord, those who remained behind decided for themselves what they must\ndo.\nThe count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sokólniki, and sat\nin his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.\nIn quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is\nonly by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going,\nand in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds\nthe chief reward of his labor and efforts. While the sea of history remains\ncalm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark, holding on with a boat hook to\nthe ship of the people and himself moving, naturally imagines that his\nefforts move the ship he is holding on to. But as soon as a storm arises and\nthe sea begins to heave and the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer\npossible. The ship moves independently with its own enormous motion, the\nboat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the\nadministrator, instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes\nan insignificant, useless, feeble man.\nRostopchín felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.\nThe superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to\nsee him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the\nhorses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent of\npolice, after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had received,\ninformed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the courtyard\nand wished to see him.\nWithout saying a word Rostopchín rose and walked hastily to his light,\nluxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the handle,"}, {"page": 1240, "text": "let it go again, and went to the window from which he had a better view of\nthe whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in front, flourishing his arm and\nsaying something with a stern look. The blood-stained smith stood beside\nhim with a gloomy face. A drone of voices was audible through the closed\nwindow.\n“Is my carriage ready?” asked Rostopchín, stepping back from the\nwindow.\n“It is, your excellency,” replied the adjutant.\nRostopchín went again to the balcony door.\n“But what do they want?” he asked the superintendent of police.\n“Your excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your orders,\nto go against the French, and they shouted something about treachery. But it\nis a turbulent crowd, your excellency—I hardly managed to get away from\nit. Your excellency, I venture to suggest...”\n“You may go. I don’t need you to tell me what to do!” exclaimed\nRostopchín angrily.\nHe stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.\n“This is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have done\nwith me!” thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled up within him\nagainst the someone to whom what was happening might be attributed. As\noften happens with passionate people, he was mastered by anger but was\nstill seeking an object on which to vent it. “Here is that mob, the dregs of\nthe people,” he thought as he gazed at the crowd: “this rabble they have\nroused by their folly! They want a victim,” he thought as he looked at the\ntall lad flourishing his arm. And this thought occurred to him just because\nhe himself desired a victim, something on which to vent his rage.\n“Is the carriage ready?” he asked again.\n“Yes, your excellency. What are your orders about Vereshchágin? He is\nwaiting at the porch,” said the adjutant.\n“Ah!” exclaimed Rostopchín, as if struck by an unexpected recollection.\nAnd rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony.\nThe talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed, and all eyes were\nraised to the count."}, {"page": 1241, "text": "“Good morning, lads!” said the count briskly and loudly. “Thank you for\ncoming. I’ll come out to you in a moment, but we must first settle with the\nvillain. We must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of Moscow.\nWait for me!”\nAnd the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the\ndoor behind him.\nA murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd. “He’ll\nsettle with all the villains, you’ll see! And you said the French... He’ll show\nyou what law is!” the mob were saying as if reproving one another for their\nlack of confidence.\nA few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door, gave\nan order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved eagerly\nfrom the balcony toward the porch. Rostopchín, coming out there with\nquick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking someone.\n“Where is he?” he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man\ncoming round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a long\nthin neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again covered by\nshort hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat lined\nwith fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty hempen convict trousers,\nover which were pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots. On his thin,\nweak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute movements.\n“Ah!” said Rostopchín, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young\nman in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch. “Put\nhim there.”\nThe young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot\nindicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed his\nneck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and submissively\nfolded before him his thin hands, unused to work.\nFor several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step\nthe silence continued. Only among the back rows of the people, who were\nall pressing toward the one spot, could sighs, groans, and the shuffling of\nfeet be heard.\nWhile waiting for the young man to take his place on the step Rostopchín\nstood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand."}, {"page": 1242, "text": "“Lads!” said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. “This man,\nVereshchágin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing.”\nThe young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a\nsubmissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated young\nface, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down hopelessly. At the\ncount’s first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if wishing to\nsay something or at least to meet his eye. But Rostopchín did not look at\nhim. A vein in the young man’s long thin neck swelled like a cord and went\nblue behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed.\nAll eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered more\nhopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly and\ntimidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.\n“He has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to Bonaparte.\nHe alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian name, he has caused\nMoscow to perish,” said Rostopchín in a sharp, even voice, but suddenly he\nglanced down at Vereshchágin who continued to stand in the same\nsubmissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight, he raised his arm and\naddressed the people, almost shouting:\n“Deal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.”\nThe crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one\nanother. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling atmosphere, to\nbe unable to stir, and to await something unknown, uncomprehended, and\nterrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing in front, who had seen\nand heard what had taken place before them, all stood with wide-open eyes\nand mouths, straining with all their strength, and held back the crowd that\nwas pushing behind them.\n“Beat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian name!”\nshouted Rostopchín. “Cut him down. I command it.”\nHearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopchín’s voice,\nthe crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.\n“Count!” exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshchágin in the\nmidst of the momentary silence that ensued, “Count! One God is above us\nboth....” He lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck filled\nwith blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face.\nHe did not finish what he wished to say."}, {"page": 1243, "text": "“Cut him down! I command it...” shouted Rostopchín, suddenly growing\npale like Vereshchágin.\n“Draw sabers!” cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.\nAnother still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the\nfront ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The tall youth,\nwith a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood beside\nVereshchágin.\n“Saber him!” the dragoon officer almost whispered.\nAnd one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury, struck\nVereshchágin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.\n“Ah!” cried Vereshchágin in meek surprise, looking round with a\nfrightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him. A\nsimilar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. “O Lord!”\nexclaimed a sorrowful voice.\nBut after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from Vereshchágin\nhe uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal. The barrier of\nhuman feeling, strained to the utmost, that had held the crowd in check\nsuddenly broke. The crime had begun and must now be completed. The\nplaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar\nof the crowd. Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that last\nirresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks, carrying\nthem off their feet and engulfing them all. The dragoon was about to repeat\nhis blow. Vereshchágin with a cry of horror, covering his head with his\nhands, rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth, against whom he stumbled,\nseized his thin neck with his hands and, yelling wildly, fell with him under\nthe feet of the pressing, struggling crowd.\nSome beat and tore at Vereshchágin, others at the tall youth. And the\nscreams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to\nrescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd. It was a long time\nbefore the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth, beaten almost to\ndeath. And for a long time, despite the feverish haste with which the mob\ntried to end the work that had been begun, those who were hitting,\nthrottling, and tearing at Vereshchágin were unable to kill him, for the\ncrowd pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them in the center\nand rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or let him go."}, {"page": 1244, "text": "“Hit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold Christ.... Still\nalive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture serves a thief right. Use the\nhatchet!...

Each one came up, glanced at what\nhad been done, and with horror, reproach, and astonishment pushed back\nagain.\n“O Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?”\nvoices in the crowd could be heard saying. “Quite a young fellow too...\nmust have been a merchant’s son. What men!... and they say he’s not the\nright one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And there’s another has been\nbeaten too—they say he’s nearly done for.... Oh, the people... Aren’t they\nafraid of sinning?...” said the same mob now, looking with pained distress\nat the dead body with its long, thin, half-severed neck and its livid face\nstained with blood and dust.\nA painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse in his\nexcellency’s courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it away. Two\ndragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the ground. The\ngory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its long neck trailed twisting\nalong the ground. The crowd shrank back from it.\nAt the moment when Vereshchágin fell and the crowd closed in with\nsavage yells and swayed about him, Rostopchín suddenly turned pale and,\ninstead of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him, went\nwith hurried steps and bent head, not knowing where and why, along the\npassage leading to the rooms on the ground floor. The count’s face was\nwhite and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw.\n“This way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way, please...”\nsaid a trembling, frightened voice behind him.\nCount Rostopchín was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went in\nthe direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his calèche. The distant\nroar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He hastily took his seat\nand told the coachman to drive him to his country house in Sokólniki.\nWhen they reached the Myasnítski Street and could no longer hear the\nshouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with\ndissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his"}, {"page": 1245, "text": "subordinates. “The mob is terrible—disgusting,” he said to himself in\nFrench. “They are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.”\n“Count! One God is above us both!”—Vereshchágin’s words suddenly\nrecurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this was\nonly a momentary feeling and Count Rostopchín smiled disdainfully at\nhimself. “I had other duties,” thought he. “The people had to be appeased.\nMany other victims have perished and are perishing for the public good”—\nand he began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the city\nentrusted to him, and of himself—not himself as Theodore Vasílyevich\nRostopchín (he fancied that Theodore Vasílyevich Rostopchín was\nsacrificing himself for the public good) but himself as governor, the\nrepresentative of authority and of the Tsar. “Had I been simply Theodore\nVasílyevich my course of action would have been quite different, but it was\nmy duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander in chief.”\nLightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer\nhearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopchín grew physically calm\nand, as always happens, as soon as he became physically tranquil his mind\ndevised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too. The thought which\ntranquillized Rostopchín was not a new one. Since the world began and\nmen have killed one another no one has ever committed such a crime\nagainst his fellow man without comforting himself with this same idea. This\nidea is le bien public, the hypothetical welfare of other people.\nTo a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he who\ncommits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies. And\nRostopchín now knew it.\nNot only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but he\neven found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully contrived to\navail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a criminal and at the\nsame time pacify the mob.\n“Vereshchágin was tried and condemned to death,” thought Rostopchín\n(though the Senate had only condemned Vereshchágin to hard labor), “he\nwas a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go unpunished and so I have\nkilled two birds with one stone: to appease the mob I gave them a victim\nand at the same time punished a miscreant.”\nHaving reached his country house and begun to give orders about\ndomestic arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil."}, {"page": 1246, "text": "Half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the Sokólniki\nfield, no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering what was to\ncome.

He would\nmake that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all the calamities\nthat would follow the abandonment of the city and the ruin of Russia (as\nRostopchín regarded it) would fall upon his doting old head.

Thrice will I\noverthrow it and thrice re-establish it!” he cried, raising his voice higher\nand higher.\nCount Rostopchín suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd\nclosed in on Vereshchágin. He turned away. “Go fas... faster!” he cried in a\ntrembling voice to his coachman.

Even now he felt clearly that the gory\ntrace of that recollection would not pass with time, but that the terrible\nmemory would, on the contrary, dwell in his heart ever more cruelly and\npainfully to the end of his life. He seemed still to hear the sound of his own\nwords: “Cut him down! I command it....”\n“Why did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said them.... I\nneed not have said them,” he thought. “And then nothing would have\nhappened.” He saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon\nwho dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid reproach that boy in the fur-\nlined coat had turned upon him. “But I did not do it for my own sake. I was\nbound to act that way.... The mob, the traitor... the public welfare,” thought\nhe.\nTroops were still crowding at the Yaúza bridge. It was hot. Kutúzov,\ndejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his whip in\nthe sand when a calèche dashed up noisily. A man in a general’s uniform\nwith plumes in his hat went up to Kutúzov and said something in French. It\nwas Count Rostopchín. He told Kutúzov that he had come because\nMoscow, the capital, was no more and only the army remained.\n“Things would have been different if your Serene Highness had not told\nme that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle; all this\nwould not have happened,” he said.\nKutúzov looked at Rostopchín as if, not grasping what was said to him,\nhe was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the face\nof the man addressing him. Rostopchín grew confused and became silent.\nKutúzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating gaze from\nRostopchín’s face muttered softly:\n“No! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!”\nWhether Kutúzov was thinking of something entirely different when he\nspoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be\nmeaningless, at any rate Rostopchín made no reply and hastily left him.\nAnd strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count Rostopchín,\ntook up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts\nto drive on the carts that blocked the way."}, {"page": 1248, "text": "CHAPTER XXVI\nToward four o’clock in the afternoon Murat’s troops were entering\nMoscow. In front rode a detachment of Württemberg hussars and behind\nthem rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.\nAbout the middle of the Arbát Street, near the Church of the Miraculous\nIcon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the advanced\ndetachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel, le\nKremlin.\nAround Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow.\nThey all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired\ncommander dressed up in feathers and gold.\n“Is that their Tsar himself? He’s not bad!” low voices could be heard\nsaying.\nAn interpreter rode up to the group.\n“Take off your cap... your caps!” These words went from one to another\nin the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it was far\nto the Krémlin. The porter, listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar Polish\naccent and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking Russian, did not\nunderstand what was being said to him and slipped behind the others.\nMurat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the Russian\narmy was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and several\nvoices at once began answering the interpreter. A French officer, returning\nfrom the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat and reported that the gates\nof the citadel had been barricaded and that there was probably an\nambuscade there.\n“Good!” said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite,\nordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates.\nThe guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and\nadvanced up the Arbát. When they reached the end of the Vozdvízhenka"}, {"page": 1249, "text": "Street they halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers\nsuperintended the placing of the guns and looked at the Krémlin through\nfield glasses.\nThe bells in the Krémlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound\ntroubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few\ninfantrymen ran to the Kutáfyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had been\nput there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as an\nofficer and men began to run toward it. A general who was standing by the\nguns shouted some words of command to the officer, and the latter ran back\nagain with his men.\nThe sound of three more shots came from the gate.\nOne shot struck a French soldier’s foot, and from behind the screens\ncame the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a word of\ncommand the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the French\ngeneral, officers, and men changed to one of determined concentrated\nreadiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from the marshal to the\nleast soldier, that place was not the Vozdvízhenka, Mokhaváya, or Kutáfyev\nStreet, nor the Tróitsa Gate (places familiar in Moscow), but a new\nbattlefield which would probably prove sanguinary. And all made ready for\nthat battle. The cries from the gates ceased. The guns were advanced, the\nartillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks, and an officer gave the word\n“Fire!” This was followed by two whistling sounds of canister shot, one\nafter another. The shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the\nwooden beams and screens, and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over\nthe Square.\nA few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stone-\nbuilt Krémlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above their\nhead. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the air,\ncawing and noisily flapping their wings. Together with that sound came a\nsolitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the\nfigure of a bareheaded man in a peasant’s coat. He grasped a musket and\ntook aim at the French. “Fire!” repeated the officer once more, and the\nreports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously.\nThe gate was again hidden by smoke.\nNothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers\nand officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three wounded and"}, {"page": 1250, "text": "four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall,\ntoward the Známenka.\n“Clear that away!” said the officer, pointing to the beams and the corpses,\nand the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw the corpses\nover the parapet.\nWho these men were nobody knew. “Clear that away!” was all that was\nsaid of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on\nthat they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to\ntheir memory: “These wretches had occupied the sacred citadel, having\nsupplied themselves with guns from the arsenal, and fired” (the wretches)\n“at the French. Some of them were sabered and the Krémlin was purged of\ntheir presence.”\nMurat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered\nthe gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of the\nwindows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square for\nfuel and kindled fires there.\nOther detachments passed through the Krémlin and encamped along the\nMoroséyka, the Lubyánka, and Pokróvka Streets. Others quartered\nthemselves along the Vozdvízhenka, the Nikólski, and the Tverskóy Streets.\nNo masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French were not\nbilleted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as in a camp.\nThough tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their original\nnumber, the French entered Moscow in good marching order. It was a\nweary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army. But it remained\nan army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their different lodgings. As\nsoon as the men of the various regiments began to disperse among the\nwealthy and deserted houses, the army was lost forever and there came into\nbeing something nondescript, neither citizens nor soldiers but what are\nknown as marauders. When five weeks later these same men left Moscow,\nthey no longer formed an army. They were a mob of marauders, each\ncarrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him valuable or useful. The\naim of each man when he left Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to\nconquer, but merely to keep what he had acquired. Like a monkey which\nputs its paw into the narrow neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of\nnuts will not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore\nperishes, the French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish"}, {"page": 1251, "text": "because they carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they had\nstolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw\nand let go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a\nMoscow district, not a soldier or officer was left. Men in military uniforms\nand Hessian boots could be seen through the windows, laughing and\nwalking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms similar men were\nbusy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open\ncoach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and\nbaking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening, amusing,\nor caressing women and children. There were many such men both in the\nshops and houses—but there was no army.\nOrder after order was issued by the French commanders that day\nforbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding any\nviolence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call for that\nvery evening. But despite all these measures the men, who had till then\nconstituted an army, flowed all over the wealthy, deserted city with its\ncomforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd of cattle keeps well\ntogether when crossing a barren field, but gets out of hand and at once\ndisperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich pastures, so did the army\ndisperse all over the wealthy city.\nNo residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers—like water\npercolating through sand—spread irresistibly through the city in all\ndirections from the Krémlin into which they had first marched. The cavalry,\non entering a merchant’s house that had been abandoned and finding there\nstabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on, all the same, to the\nnext house which seemed to them better. Many of them appropriated\nseveral houses, chalked their names on them, and quarreled and even fought\nwith other companies for them. Before they had had time to secure quarters\nthe soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city and, hearing that\neverything had been abandoned, rushed to places where valuables were to\nbe had for the taking. The officers followed to check the soldiers and were\ninvoluntarily drawn into doing the same. In Carriage Row carriages had\nbeen left in the shops, and generals flocked there to select calèches and\ncoaches for themselves. The few inhabitants who had remained invited\ncommanding officers to their houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves\nfrom being plundered. There were masses of wealth and there seemed no\nend to it.

In reality,\nhowever, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning of\nMoscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible for\nit. Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which any\ntown built of wood was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it had, or\nhad not, a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines. Deserted Moscow had to\nburn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on which sparks\ncontinually fall for several days. A town built of wood, where scarcely a day\npasses without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a\npolice force is present, cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left it\nand it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes, make campfires of the\nSenate chairs in the Senate Square, and cook themselves meals twice a day.\nIn peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the villages of any\ndistrict and the number of fires in that district immediately increases. How\nmuch then must the probability of fire be increased in an abandoned,\nwooden town where foreign troops are quartered. “Le patriotisme féroce de\nRostopchíne” and the barbarity of the French were not to blame in the\nmatter. Moscow was set on fire by the soldiers’ pipes, kitchens, and\ncampfires, and by the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they\ndid not own. Even if there was any arson (which is very doubtful, for no\none had any reason to burn the houses—in any case a troublesome and\ndangerous thing to do), arson cannot be regarded as the cause, for the same\nthing would have happened without any incendiarism.\n* To Rostopchín’s ferocious patriotism.\nHowever tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopchín’s\nferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later on to\nplace an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is impossible not\nto see that there could be no such direct cause of the fire, for Moscow had"}, {"page": 1253, "text": "to burn as every village, factory, or house must burn which is left by its\nowners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge.\nMoscow was burned by its inhabitants, it is true, but by those who had\nabandoned it and not by those who remained in it.

He was completely obsessed by\none persistent thought. He did not know how or when this thought had\ntaken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of the past,\nunderstood nothing of the present, and all he saw and heard appeared to him\nlike a dream.\nHe had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life’s demands that\nenmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was unable to unravel.\nHe had gone to Joseph Alexéevich’s house, on the plea of sorting the\ndeceased’s books and papers, only in search of rest from life’s turmoil, for\nin his mind the memory of Joseph Alexéevich was connected with a world\nof eternal, solemn, and calm thoughts, quite contrary to the restless\nconfusion into which he felt himself being drawn. He sought a quiet refuge,\nand in Joseph Alexéevich’s study he really found it. When he sat with his\nelbows on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study,\ncalm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after another in\nhis imagination, particularly of the battle of Borodinó and of that vague\nsense of his own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth,\nsimplicity, and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they.\nWhen Gerásim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of\ntaking part in the popular defense of Moscow which he knew was projected.\nAnd with that object he had asked Gerásim to get him a peasant’s coat and a\npistol, confiding to him his intentions of remaining in Joseph Alexéevich’s\nhouse and keeping his name secret. Then during the first day spent in\ninaction and solitude (he tried several times to fix his attention on the\nMasonic manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea that had previously"}, {"page": 1255, "text": "occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in connection\nwith Bonaparte’s more than once vaguely presented itself. But the idea that\nhe, L’russe Besuhof, was destined to set a limit to the power of the Beast\nwas as yet only one of the fancies that often passed through his mind and\nleft no trace behind.\nWhen, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part\namong the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the Rostóvs\nand Natásha had said to him: “Are you remaining in Moscow?... How\nsplendid!” the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good\nthing, even if Moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he\nwas predestined to do.\nNext day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in any\nway behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he returned\nto the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he suddenly\nfelt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility had now\nbecome absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in Moscow,\nconcealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and either\nperish or put an end to the misery of all Europe—which it seemed to him\nwas solely due to Napoleon.\nPierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte’s life in 1809 by a\nGerman student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been shot. And\nthe risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his design excited\nhim still more.\nTwo equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose. The\nfirst was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in view of the\ncommon calamity, the same feeling that had caused him to go to Mozháysk\non the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick of the battle and\nhad now caused him to run away from his home and, in place of the luxury\nand comfort to which he was accustomed, to sleep on a hard sofa without\nundressing and eat the same food as Gerásim. The other was that vague and\nquite Russian feeling of contempt for everything conventional, artificial,\nand human—for everything the majority of men regard as the greatest good\nin the world. Pierre had first experienced this strange and fascinating\nfeeling at the Slobóda Palace, when he had suddenly felt that wealth, power,\nand life—all that men so painstakingly acquire and guard—if it has any\nworth has so only by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced."}, {"page": 1256, "text": "It was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last penny\non drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no apparent\nreason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he possesses: the\nfeeling which causes a man to perform actions which from an ordinary\npoint of view are insane, to test, as it were, his personal power and strength,\naffirming the existence of a higher, nonhuman criterion of life.\nFrom the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time at\nthe Slobóda Palace he had been continuously under its influence, but only\nnow found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre was\nsupported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he had\nalready done in that direction. If he were now to leave Moscow like\neveryone else, his flight from home, the peasant coat, the pistol, and his\nannouncement to the Rostóvs that he would remain in Moscow would all\nbecome not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous, and to this\nPierre was very sensitive.\nPierre’s physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded to his\nmental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he drank during\nthose days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty unchanged linen, two\nalmost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding—all this\nkept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity.\nIt was two o’clock in the afternoon. The French had already entered\nMoscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about his\nundertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind. In his fancy he did\nnot clearly picture to himself either the striking of the blow or the death of\nNapoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment\nimagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.\n“Yes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!” he thought. “Yes, I\nwill approach... and then suddenly... with pistol or dagger? But that is all the\nsame! ‘It is not I but the hand of Providence that punishes thee,’ I shall say,”\nthought he, imagining what he would say when killing Napoleon. “Well\nthen, take me and execute me!” he went on, speaking to himself and bowing\nhis head with a sad but firm expression.\nWhile Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to himself\nin this way, the study door opened and on the threshold appeared the figure\nof Makár Alexéevich, always so timid before but now quite transformed."}, {"page": 1257, "text": "His dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He was\nobviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but noticing\nembarrassment on Pierre’s face immediately grew bold and, staggering on\nhis thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.\n“They’re frightened,” he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. “I say I\nwon’t surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?”\nHe paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it with\nunexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.\nGerásim and the porter, who had followed Makár Alexéevich, stopped\nhim in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre, coming out\ninto the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the half-crazy old man.\nMakár Alexéevich, frowning with exertion, held on to the pistol and\nscreamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic fancy in his head.\n“To arms! Board them! No, you shan’t get it,” he yelled.\n“That will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness—please, sir, to let\ngo! Please, sir...” pleaded Gerásim, trying carefully to steer Makár\nAlexéevich by the elbows back to the door.\n“Who are you? Bonaparte!...” shouted Makár Alexéevich.\n“That’s not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow me to\nhave the pistol.”\n“Be off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?” shouted Makár\nAlexéevich, brandishing the pistol. “Board them!”\n“Catch hold!” whispered Gerásim to the porter.\nThey seized Makár Alexéevich by the arms and dragged him to the door.\nThe vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of a\ntipsy, hoarse voice.\nSuddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated from\nthe porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.\n“It’s them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!” she\ncried.\nGerásim and the porter let Makár Alexéevich go, and in the now silent\ncorridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be\nheard."}, {"page": 1258, "text": "CHAPTER XXVIII\nPierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he would\ndisclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood at the half-\nopen door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as soon as the\nFrench entered. But the French entered and still Pierre did not retire—an\nirresistible curiosity kept him there.\nThere were two of them. One was an officer—a tall, soldierly, handsome\nman—the other evidently a private or an orderly, sunburned, short, and thin,\nwith sunken cheeks and a dull expression. The officer walked in front,\nleaning on a stick and slightly limping. When he had advanced a few steps\nhe stopped, having apparently decided that these were good quarters, turned\nround to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in a loud voice of\ncommand ordered them to put up the horses. Having done that, the officer,\nlifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his mustache and lightly\ntouched his hat.\n“Bonjour, la compagnie!” * said he gaily, smiling and looking about\nhim.\n* “Good day, everybody!”\nNo one gave any reply.\n“Vous êtes le bourgeois?” * the officer asked Gerásim.\n* “Are you the master here?”\nGerásim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.\n“Quartier, quartier, logement!” said the officer, looking down at the little\nman with a condescending and good-natured smile. “Les français sont de\nbons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous fâchons pas, mon vieux!” *\nadded he, clapping the scared and silent Gerásim on the shoulder. “Well,\ndoes no one speak French in this establishment?” he asked again in French,"}, {"page": 1259, "text": "looking around and meeting Pierre’s eyes.

What the devil!\nThere, don’t let us be cross, old fellow!”\nAgain the officer turned to Gerásim and asked him to show him the\nrooms in the house.\n“Master, not here—don’t understand... me, you...” said Gerásim, trying to\nrender his words more comprehensible by contorting them.\nStill smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before Gerásim’s\nnose, intimating that he did not understand him either, and moved, limping,\nto the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre wished to go away and\nconceal himself, but at that moment he saw Makár Alexéevich appearing at\nthe open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand. With a madman’s cunning,\nMakár Alexéevich eyed the Frenchman, raised his pistol, and took aim.\n“Board them!” yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger. Hearing\nthe yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment Pierre threw\nhimself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the\npistol Makár Alexéevich at last got his fingers on the trigger, there was a\ndeafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The\nFrenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.\nForgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French, Pierre,\nsnatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to the officer and\naddressed him in French.\n“You are not wounded?” he asked.\n“I think not,” answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. “But I have\nhad a lucky escape this time,” he added, pointing to the damaged plaster of\nthe wall. “Who is that man?” said he, looking sternly at Pierre.\n“Oh, I am really in despair at what has occurred,” said Pierre rapidly,\nquite forgetting the part he had intended to play. “He is an unfortunate\nmadman who did not know what he was doing.”\nThe officer went up to Makár Alexéevich and took him by the collar.\nMakár Alexéevich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about to\nfall asleep, as he leaned against the wall."}, {"page": 1260, "text": "“Brigand! You shall pay for this,” said the Frenchman, letting go of him.\n“We French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon traitors,” he\nadded, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic gesture.\nPierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold that\ndrunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence with the\nsame gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with a smile. For a\nfew seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome face assumed a\nmelodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand.\n“You have saved my life. You are French,” said he.\nFor a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman\ncould perform a great deed, and to save his life—the life of M. Ramballe,\ncaptain of the 13th Light Regiment—was undoubtedly a very great deed.\nBut however indubitable that conclusion and the officer’s conviction\nbased upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.\n“I am Russian,” he said quickly.\n“Tut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,” said the officer, waving his finger\nbefore his nose and smiling. “You shall tell me all about that presently. I am\ndelighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what are we to do with this man?”\nhe added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a brother.\nEven if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that loftiest\nof human appellations he could not renounce it, said the officer’s look and\ntone. In reply to his last question Pierre again explained who Makár\nAlexéevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile had\nseized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from him,\nand begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished.\nThe Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his\narm.\n“You have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant it\nyou. Lead that man away!” said he quickly and energetically, and taking the\narm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for saving his life,\nhe went with him into the room.\nThe soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage asking\nwhat had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits, but\nthe officer sternly checked them.\n“You will be called in when you are wanted,” he said."}, {"page": 1261, "text": "The soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile had\ntime to visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.\n“Captain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen,” said he.\n“Shall I serve them up?”\n“Yes, and some wine,” answered the captain."}, {"page": 1262, "text": "CHAPTER XXIX\nWhen the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again\nthought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to go\naway, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so very polite, amiable,\ngood-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his life that Pierre\nhad not the heart to refuse, and sat down with him in the parlor—the first\nroom they entered. To Pierre’s assurances that he was not a Frenchman, the\ncaptain, evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering\nan appellation, shrugged his shoulders and said that if Pierre absolutely\ninsisted on passing for a Russian let it be so, but for all that he would be\nforever bound to Pierre by gratitude for saving his life.\nHad this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the\nfeelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre’s feelings were,\nthe latter would probably have left him, but the man’s animated obtuseness\nto everything other than himself disarmed Pierre.\n“A Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,” said the officer, looking at\nPierre’s fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger. “I owe my life\nto you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman never forgets either an\ninsult or a service. I offer you my friendship. That is all I can say.”\nThere was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of the\nword) in the officer’s voice, in the expression of his face and in his gestures,\nthat Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the Frenchman’s smile,\npressed the hand held out to him.\n“Captain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion\nof Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,” he introduced himself,\na self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under his mustache.\n“Will you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have the honor of\nconversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance with that\nmaniac’s bullet in my body?”"}, {"page": 1263, "text": "Pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing, began to\ntry to invent a name and to say something about his reason for concealing it,\nbut the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.\n“Oh, please!” said he. “I understand your reasons. You are an officer... a\nsuperior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us. That’s not my\nbusiness. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am quite at your\nservice. You belong to the gentry?” he concluded with a shade of inquiry in\nhis tone. Pierre bent his head. “Your baptismal name, if you please. That is\nall I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say.... That’s all I want to know.”\nWhen the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and\nvodka brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a Russian\ncellar and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share his dinner,\nand himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry\nman, munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth, continually smacking\nhis lips, and repeating—“Excellent! Delicious!” His face grew red and was\ncovered with perspiration. Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with\npleasure. Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan and\nplaced a bottle of claret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass, taken from\nthe kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known to the French\nand had been given a special name. They called it limonade de cochon\n(pig’s lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de cochon he had\nfound in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they had taken while\npassing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and applied himself to\nthe bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up to its neck in a table\nnapkin and poured out wine for himself and for Pierre. The satisfaction of\nhis hunger and the wine rendered the captain still more lively and he chatted\nincessantly all through dinner.\n“Yes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for saving\nme from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my body already.\nHere is one I got at Wagram” (he touched his side) “and a second at\nSmolénsk”—he showed a scar on his cheek—“and this leg which as you\nsee does not want to march, I got that on the seventh at the great battle of la\nMoskowa. Sacré Dieu! It was splendid! That deluge of fire was worth\nseeing. It was a tough job you set us there, my word! You may be proud of\nit! And on my honor, in spite of the cough I caught there, I should be ready\nto begin again. I pity those who did not see it.”"}, {"page": 1264, "text": "“I was there,” said Pierre.\n“Bah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes. The great\nredoubt held out well, by my pipe!” continued the Frenchman. “And you\nmade us pay dear for it. I was at it three times—sure as I sit here. Three\ntimes we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back like\ncardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your grenadiers\nwere splendid, by heaven! I saw them close up their ranks six times in\nsuccession and march as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King of Naples,\nwho knows what’s what, cried ‘Bravo!’ Ha, ha! So you are one of us\nsoldiers!” he added, smiling, after a momentary pause. “So much the better,\nso much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle... gallant... with the\nfair” (he winked and smiled), “that’s what the French are, Monsieur Pierre,\naren’t they?”\nThe captain was so naïvely and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so\npleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily at\nhim. Probably the word “gallant” turned the captain’s thoughts to the state\nof Moscow.\n“Apropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left Moscow?\nWhat a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?”\n“Would not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it?”\nasked Pierre.\n“Ha, ha, ha!” The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting\nPierre on the shoulder. “What a thing to say!” he exclaimed. “Paris?... But\nParis, Paris...”\n“Paris—the capital of the world,” Pierre finished his remark for him.\nThe captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in the\nmiddle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes.\n“Well, if you hadn’t told me you were Russian, I should have wagered\nthat you were Parisian! You have that... I don’t know what, that...” and\nhaving uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.\n“I have been in Paris. I spent years there,” said Pierre.\n“Oh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn’t know Paris is\na savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Talma, la\nDuchénois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,” and noticing that his\nconclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he added quickly:"}, {"page": 1265, "text": "“There is only one Paris in the world. You have been to Paris and have\nremained Russian. Well, I don’t esteem you the less for it.”\nUnder the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days he had\nspent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily enjoyed\ntalking with this cheerful and good-natured man.\n“To return to your ladies—I hear they are lovely. What a wretched idea to\ngo and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army is in Moscow.\nWhat a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants, now—that’s another\nthing; but you civilized people, you ought to know us better than that. We\ntook Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all the world’s\ncapitals.... We are feared, but we are loved. We are nice to know. And then\nthe Emperor...” he began, but Pierre interrupted him.\n“The Emperor,” Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and\nembarrassed, “is the Emperor...?”\n“The Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, genius—that’s\nwhat the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure you I was\nhis enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But that\nman has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist the\nsight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France. When I\nunderstood what he wanted—when I saw that he was preparing a bed of\nlaurels for us, you know, I said to myself: ‘That is a monarch,’ and I\ndevoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest man\nof the ages past or future.”\n“Is he in Moscow?” Pierre stammered with a guilty look.\nThe Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.\n“No, he will make his entry tomorrow,” he replied, and continued his\ntalk.\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at the\ngate and by Morel, who came to say that some Württemberg hussars had\ncome and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captain’s\nhorses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did not\nunderstand what was said to them in French.\nThe captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern voice asked\nhim to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding officer, and\nby what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already"}, {"page": 1266, "text": "occupied. The German who knew little French, answered the two first\nquestions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding\nofficer, but in reply to the third question which he did not understand said,\nintroducing broken French into his own German, that he was the\nquartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to\noccupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who knew German,\ntranslated what the German said to the captain and gave the captain’s reply\nto the Württemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what was\nsaid to him, the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. The captain\nwent out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice.\nWhen he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as\nbefore, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He really\nwas suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and he was left\nalone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the position he was in. It\nwas not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy conquerors were\nmasters in it and were patronizing him. Painful as that was it was not that\nwhich tormented Pierre at the moment. He was tormented by the\nconsciousness of his own weakness. The few glasses of wine he had drunk\nand the conversation with this good-natured man had destroyed the mood of\nconcentrated gloom in which he had spent the last few days and which was\nessential for the execution of his design. The pistol, dagger, and peasant\ncoat were ready. Napoleon was to enter the town next day. Pierre still\nconsidered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the evildoer,\nbut now he felt that he would not do it. He did not know why, but he felt a\nforeboding that he would not carry out his intention. He struggled against\nthe confession of his weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it\nand that his former gloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing,\nand self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man\nhe met.\nThe captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a tune.\nThe Frenchman’s chatter which had previously amused Pierre now\nrepelled him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture with\nwhich he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. “I will go away\nimmediately. I won’t say another word to him,” thought Pierre. He thought\nthis, but still sat in the same place. A strange feeling of weakness tied him to\nthe spot; he wished to get up and go away, but could not do so."}, {"page": 1267, "text": "The captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up and\ndown the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he\nwere smiling to himself at some amusing thought.\n“The colonel of those Württembergers is delightful,” he suddenly said.\n“He’s a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But he’s a German.” He\nsat down facing Pierre. “By the way, you know German, then?”\nPierre looked at him in silence.\n“What is the German for ‘shelter’?”\n“Shelter?” Pierre repeated. “The German for shelter is Unterkunft.”\n“How do you say it?” the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.\n“Unterkunft,” Pierre repeated.\n“Onterkoff,” said the captain and looked at Pierre for some seconds with\nlaughing eyes. “These Germans are first-rate fools, don’t you think so,\nMonsieur Pierre?” he concluded.\n“Well, let’s have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall we?\nMorel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!” he called out gaily.\nMorel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at Pierre\nby the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression on\nhis companion’s face. Ramballe, with genuine distress and sympathy in his\nface, went up to Pierre and bent over him.\n“There now, we’re sad,” said he, touching Pierre’s hand. “Have I upset\nyou? No, really, have you anything against me?” he asked Pierre. “Perhaps\nit’s the state of affairs?”\nPierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman’s eyes\nwhose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.\n“Honestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for you.\nCan I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and death. I say it\nwith my hand on my heart!” said he, striking his chest.\n“Thank you,” said Pierre.\nThe captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that\n“shelter” was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly brightened.\n“Well, in that case, I drink to our friendship!” he cried gaily, filling two\nglasses with wine."}, {"page": 1268, "text": "Pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied his too,\nagain pressed Pierre’s hand, and leaned his elbows on the table in a pensive\nattitude.\n“Yes, my dear friend,” he began, “such is fortune’s caprice. Who would\nhave said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the service\nof Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am in Moscow with him. I\nmust tell you, mon cher,” he continued in the sad and measured tones of a\nman who intends to tell a long story, “that our name is one of the most\nancient in France.”\nAnd with a Frenchman’s easy and naïve frankness the captain told Pierre\nthe story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and manhood, and all about\nhis relations and his financial and family affairs, “ma pauvre mère” playing\nof course an important part in the story.\n“But all that is only life’s setting, the real thing is love—love! Am I not\nright, Monsieur Pierre?” said he, growing animated. “Another glass?”\nPierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.\n“Oh, women, women!” and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at\nPierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.\nThere were very many of these, as one could easily believe, looking at\nthe officer’s handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager enthusiasm\nwith which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballe’s love stories had the\nsensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special charm and poetry\nof love, yet he told his story with such sincere conviction that he alone had\nexperienced and known all the charm of love and he described women so\nalluringly that Pierre listened to him with curiosity.\nIt was plain that l’amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not\nthat low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor was it the\nromantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for Natásha.\n(Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the one he considered\nthe “love of clodhoppers” and the other the “love of simpletons.”) L’amour\nwhich the Frenchman worshiped consisted principally in the unnaturalness\nof his relation to the woman and in a combination of incongruities giving\nthe chief charm to the feeling.\nThus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a\nfascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming,"}, {"page": 1269, "text": "innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching marquise. The\nconflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter, ending in the\nmother’s sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage to her\nlover, even now agitated the captain, though it was the memory of a distant\npast. Then he recounted an episode in which the husband played the part of\nthe lover, and he—the lover—assumed the role of the husband, as well as\nseveral droll incidents from his recollections of Germany, where “shelter” is\ncalled Unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the young\ngirls are “too blonde.”\nFinally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain’s memory,\nand which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was of how he\nhad saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of life continually\noccurred in the captain’s stories) and the Pole had entrusted to him his\nenchanting wife (parisienne de cœur) while himself entering the French\nservice. The captain was happy, the enchanting Polish lady wished to elope\nwith him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the captain restored the wife to\nthe husband, saying as he did so: “I have saved your life, and I save your\nhonor!” Having repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave\nhimself a shake, as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this\ntouching recollection.\nListening to the captain’s tales, Pierre—as often happens late in the\nevening and under the influence of wine—followed all that was told him,\nunderstood it all, and at the same time followed a train of personal\nmemories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his mind. While\nlistening to these love stories his own love for Natásha unexpectedly rose to\nhis mind, and going over the pictures of that love in his imagination he\nmentally compared them with Ramballe’s tales. Listening to the story of the\nstruggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before his eyes every minutest\ndetail of his last meeting with the object of his love at the Súkharev water\ntower. At the time of that meeting it had not produced an effect upon him—\nhe had not even once recalled it. But now it seemed to him that that meeting\nhad had in it something very important and poetic.\n“Peter Kirílovich, come here! We have recognized you,” he now seemed\nto hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes, her smile,\nher traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and there seemed to him\nsomething pathetic and touching in all this."}, {"page": 1270, "text": "Having finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the captain\nasked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice\nhimself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.\nChallenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to\nexpress the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that he\nunderstood love for a woman somewhat differently. He said that in all his\nlife he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could never\nbe his.\n“Tiens!” said the captain.\nPierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest\nyears, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too young,\nand because he had been an illegitimate son without a name. Afterwards\nwhen he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of her because\nhe loved her too well, placing her far above everything in the world, and\nespecially therefore above himself.\nWhen he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he\nunderstood that.\nThe captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand\nit he begged Pierre to continue.\n“Platónic love, clouds...” he muttered.\nWhether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the\nthought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who\nplayed a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together,\nsomething loosened Pierre’s tongue. Speaking thickly and with a faraway\nlook in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his marriage,\nNatásha’s love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and all his own\nsimple relations with her. Urged on by Ramballe’s questions he also told\nwhat he had at first concealed—his own position and even his name.\nMore than anything else in Pierre’s story the captain was impressed by\nthe fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that he\nhad abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there\nconcealing his name and station.\nWhen it was late at night they went out together into the street. The night\nwas warm and light. To the left of the house on the Pokróvka a fire glowed\n—the first of those that were beginning in Moscow.

They\nwere looking at the glow seen in the town.\nThere was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the immense\ncity.\nGazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the glow\nfrom the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. “There now, how good it\nis, what more does one need?” thought he. And suddenly remembering his\nintention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned against the fence to\nsave himself from falling.\nWithout taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with unsteady\nsteps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and immediately fell\nasleep."}, {"page": 1272, "text": "CHAPTER XXX\nThe glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was\nwatched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the\nretreating troops, with many different feelings.\nThe Rostóv party spent the night at Mytíshchi, fourteen miles from\nMoscow. They had started so late on the first of September, the road had\nbeen so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been forgotten\nfor which servants were sent back, that they had decided to spend that night\nat a place three miles out of Moscow. The next morning they woke late and\nwere again delayed so often that they only got as far as Great Mytíshchi. At\nten o’clock that evening the Rostóv family and the wounded traveling with\nthem were all distributed in the yards and huts of that large village. The\nRostóvs’ servants and coachmen and the orderlies of the wounded officers,\nafter attending to their masters, had supper, fed the horses, and came out\ninto the porches.\nIn a neighboring hut lay Raévski’s adjutant with a fractured wrist. The\nawful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his\nmoaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night. He had spent\nthe first night in the same yard as the Rostóvs. The countess said she had\nbeen unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning, and at Mytíshchi\nshe moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the wounded\nman.\nIn the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above the high\nbody of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow of another fire.\nOne glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was Little\nMytíshchi burning—set on fire by Mamónov’s Cossacks.\n“But look here, brothers, there’s another fire!” remarked an orderly.\nAll turned their attention to the glow."}, {"page": 1273, "text": "“But they told us Little Mytíshchi had been set on fire by Mamónov’s\nCossacks.”\n“But that’s not Mytíshchi, it’s farther away.”\n“Look, it must be in Moscow!”\nTwo of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down\non its steps.\n“It’s more to the left, why, Little Mytíshchi is over there, and this is right\non the other side.”\nSeveral men joined the first two.\n“See how it’s flaring,” said one. “That’s a fire in Moscow: either in the\nSushchévski or the Rogózhski quarter.”\nNo one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently at\nthe spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.\nOld Daniel Teréntich, the count’s valet (as he was called), came up to the\ngroup and shouted at Míshka.\n“What are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be\ncalling and there’s nobody there; go and gather the clothes together.”\n“I only ran out to get some water,” said Míshka.\n“But what do you think, Daniel Teréntich? Doesn’t it look as if that glow\nwere in Moscow?” remarked one of the footmen.\nDaniel Teréntich made no reply, and again for a long time they were all\nsilent. The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and farther still.\n“God have mercy.... It’s windy and dry...” said another voice.\n“Just look! See what it’s doing now. O Lord! You can even see the crows\nflying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!”\n“They’ll put it out, no fear!”\n“Who’s to put it out?” Daniel Teréntich, who had hitherto been silent,\nwas heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. “Moscow it is,\nbrothers,” said he. “Mother Moscow, the white...” his voice faltered, and he\ngave way to an old man’s sob.\nAnd it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the\nsignificance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were heard,\nwords of prayer, and the sobbing of the count’s old valet."}, {"page": 1274, "text": "CHAPTER XXXI\nThe valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that Moscow was\nburning. The count donned his dressing gown and went out to look. Sónya\nand Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out with him. Only\nNatásha and the countess remained in the room. Pétya was no longer with\nthe family, he had gone on with his regiment which was making for Tróitsa.\nThe countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry. Natásha,\npale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the icons just where\nshe had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father’s words.\nShe was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant, three houses off.\n“Oh, how terrible,” said Sónya returning from the yard chilled and\nfrightened. “I believe the whole of Moscow will burn, there’s an awful\nglow! Natásha, do look! You can see it from the window,” she said to her\ncousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.\nBut Natásha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her\nand again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had been in this\ncondition of stupor since the morning, when Sónya, to the surprise and\nannoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found it\nnecessary to tell Natásha of Prince Andrew’s wound and of his being with\ntheir party. The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as she was\nwith Sónya. Sónya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now, as if\ntrying to atone for her fault, paid unceasing attention to her cousin.\n“Look, Natásha, how dreadfully it is burning!” said she.\n“What’s burning?” asked Natásha. “Oh, yes, Moscow.”\nAnd as if in order not to offend Sónya and to get rid of her, she turned her\nface to the window, looked out in such a way that it was evident that she\ncould not see anything, and again settled down in her former attitude.\n“But you didn’t see it!”"}, {"page": 1275, "text": "“Yes, really I did,” Natásha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left in\npeace.\nBoth the countess and Sónya understood that, naturally, neither Moscow\nnor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to\nNatásha.\nThe count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess went\nup to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she\nwas wont to do when Natásha was ill, then touched her forehead with her\nlips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.\n“You are cold. You are trembling all over. You’d better lie down,” said\nthe countess.\n“Lie down? All right, I will. I’ll lie down at once,” said Natásha.\nWhen Natásha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was\nseriously wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked\nmany questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it\nserious? And could she see him? But after she had been told that she could\nnot see him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in\ndanger, she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving\nwhat they told her, and convinced that say what she might she would still be\ntold the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a corner of the coach\nwith wide open eyes, and the expression in them which the countess knew\nso well and feared so much, and now she sat in the same way on the bench\nwhere she had seated herself on arriving. She was planning something and\neither deciding or had already decided something in her mind. The countess\nknew this, but what it might be she did not know, and this alarmed and\ntormented her.\n“Natásha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.”\nA bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame\nSchoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.\n“No, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,” Natásha replied irritably\nand she went to the window and opened it. Through the open window the\nmoans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put her head out\ninto the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with\nsobs and throbbing against the window frame. Natásha knew it was not\nPrince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in the"}, {"page": 1276, "text": "same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage; but this\ndreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess exchanged a look\nwith Sónya.\n“Lie down, darling; lie down, my pet,” said the countess, softly touching\nNatásha’s shoulders. “Come, lie down.”\n“Oh, yes... I’ll lie down at once,” said Natásha, and began hurriedly\nundressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.\nWhen she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, she sat\ndown with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the floor,\njerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front, and began\nreplaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers rapidly unplaited, replaited,\nand tied up her plait. Her head moved from side to side from habit, but her\neyes, feverishly wide, looked fixedly before her. When her toilet for the\nnight was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the\nside nearest the door.\n“Natásha, you’d better lie in the middle,” said Sónya.\n“I’ll stay here,” muttered Natásha. “Do lie down,” she added crossly, and\nburied her face in the pillow.\nThe countess, Madame Schoss, and Sónya undressed hastily and lay\ndown. The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the\nroom. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little Mytíshchi a\nmile and a half away, and through the night came the noise of people\nshouting at a tavern Mamónov’s Cossacks had set up across the street, and\nthe adjutant’s unceasing moans could still be heard.\nFor a long time Natásha listened attentively to the sounds that reached\nher from inside and outside the room and did not move. First she heard her\nmother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her, then\nMadame Schoss’ familiar whistling snore and Sónya’s gentle breathing.\nThen the countess called to Natásha. Natásha did not answer.\n“I think she’s asleep, Mamma,” said Sónya softly.\nAfter a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one\nreplied.\nSoon after that Natásha heard her mother’s even breathing. Natásha did\nnot move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt, was\ngrowing cold on the bare floor."}, {"page": 1277, "text": "As if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in a crack in\nthe wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near by. The shouting in\nthe tavern had died down; only the moaning of the adjutant was heard.\nNatásha sat up.\n“Sónya, are you asleep? Mamma?” she whispered.\nNo one replied. Natásha rose slowly and carefully, crossed herself, and\nstepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim, supple, bare\nfeet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping cautiously from one foot to\nthe other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold\ndoor handle.\nIt seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against\nall the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking with alarm and\nterror and overflowing with love.\nShe opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold,\ndamp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed her. With her\nbare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened the\ndoor into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay. It was dark in there.\nIn the farthest corner, on a bench beside a bed on which something was\nlying, stood a tallow candle with a long, thick, and smoldering wick.\nFrom the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrew’s\nwound and his presence there, Natásha had resolved to see him. She did not\nknow why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but felt the\nmore convinced that it was necessary.\nAll day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now that\nthe moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might see. How\nwas he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that incessant moaning\nof the adjutant’s? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her imagination he was\nthat terrible moaning personified. When she saw an indistinct shape in the\ncorner, and mistook his knees raised under the quilt for his shoulders, she\nimagined a horrible body there, and stood still in terror. But an irresistible\nimpulse drew her forward. She cautiously took one step and then another,\nand found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage.\nAnother man—Timókhin—was lying in a corner on the benches beneath\nthe icons, and two others—the doctor and a valet—lay on the floor.\nThe valet sat up and whispered something.

The\nvalet’s sleepy, frightened exclamation, “What do you want? What’s the\nmatter?” made Natásha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the\ncorner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him. She\npassed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw Prince\nAndrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and such as she had always\nseen him.\nHe was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his glittering\neyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his neck, delicate as a\nchild’s, revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt, gave him a peculiarly\ninnocent, childlike look, such as she had never seen on him before. She\nwent up to him and with a swift, flexible, youthful movement dropped on\nher knees.\nHe smiled and held out his hand to her."}, {"page": 1279, "text": "CHAPTER XXXII\nSeven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the\nambulance station on the field of Borodinó. His feverish state and the\ninflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctor’s\nopinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a\npiece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that his temperature\nwas lower. He had regained consciousness that morning. The first night\nafter they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had remained in the\ncalèche, but at Mytíshchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out\nand given some tea. The pain caused by his removal into the hut had made\nhim groan aloud and again lose consciousness. When he had been placed on\nhis camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes. Then he\nopened them and whispered softly: “And the tea?” His remembering such a\nsmall detail of everyday life astonished the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew’s\npulse, and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved. He was\ndissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die\nnow, he would do so a little later with greater suffering. Timókhin, the red-\nnosed major of Prince Andrew’s regiment, had joined him in Moscow and\nwas being taken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the\nbattle of Borodinó. They were accompanied by a doctor, Prince Andrew’s\nvalet, his coachman, and two orderlies.\nThey gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking with\nfeverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and\nremember something.\n“I don’t want any more. Is Timókhin here?” he asked.\nTimókhin crept along the bench to him.\n“I am here, your excellency.”\n“How’s your wound?”\n“Mine, sir? All right. But how about you?”"}, {"page": 1280, "text": "Prince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.\n“Couldn’t one get a book?” he asked.\n“What book?”\n“The Gospels. I haven’t one.”\nThe doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was\nfeeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but\nreasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was\nuncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted the cloak with\nwhich he was covered and, making wry faces at the noisome smell of\nmortifying flesh that came from the wound, began examining that dreadful\nplace. The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a\nchange in the dressings, turning the wounded man over so that he groaned\nagain and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept asking\nthem to get him the book and put it under him.\n“What trouble would it be to you?” he said. “I have not got one. Please\nget it for me and put it under for a moment,” he pleaded in a piteous voice.\nThe doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.\n“You fellows have no conscience,” said he to the valet who was pouring\nwater over his hands. “For just one moment I didn’t look after you... It’s\nsuch pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it.”\n“By the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under him!”\nsaid the valet.\nThe first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the\nmatter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he\nasked to be carried into the hut after his calèche had stopped at Mytíshchi.\nAfter growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he again\nregained consciousness, and while drinking tea once more recalled all that\nhad happened to him, and above all vividly remembered the moment at the\nambulance station when, at the sight of the sufferings of a man he disliked,\nthose new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness. And\nthose thoughts, though now vague and indefinite, again possessed his soul.\nHe remembered that he had now a new source of happiness and that this\nhappiness had something to do with the Gospels. That was why he asked for\na copy of them. The uncomfortable position in which they had put him and\nturned him over again confused his thoughts, and when he came to himself"}, {"page": 1281, "text": "a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night. Everybody near\nhim was sleeping. A cricket chirped from across the passage; someone was\nshouting and singing in the street; cockroaches rustled on the table, on the\nicons, and on the walls, and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and\naround the candle beside him, the wick of which was charred and had\nshaped itself like a mushroom.\nHis mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of,\nfeels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the power\nand will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his\nwhole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest\nreflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return\nagain to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrew’s mind was not in a normal\nstate in that respect. All the powers of his mind were more active and\nclearer than ever, but they acted apart from his will. Most diverse thoughts\nand images occupied him simultaneously. At times his brain suddenly began\nto work with a vigor, clearness, and depth it had never reached when he was\nin health, but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some\nunexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again.\n“Yes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be\ndeprived,” he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut, gazing\nfixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes. “A happiness lying\nbeyond material forces, outside the material influences that act on man—a\nhappiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving. Every man can\nunderstand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for God.\nBut how did God enjoin that law? And why was the Son...?”\nAnd suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince\nAndrew heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality) a soft\nwhispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating “piti-piti-piti,” and\nthen “titi,” and then again “piti-piti-piti,” and “ti-ti” once more. At the same\ntime he felt that above his face, above the very middle of it, some strange\nairy structure was being erected out of slender needles or splinters, to the\nsound of this whispered music. He felt that he had to balance carefully\n(though it was difficult) so that this airy structure should not collapse; but\nnevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of\nwhispered rhythmic music—“it stretches, stretches, spreading out and\nstretching,” said Prince Andrew to himself. While listening to this"}, {"page": 1282, "text": "whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the\nconstruction of this edifice of needles, he also saw by glimpses a red halo\nround the candle, and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of\nthe fly that flopped against his pillow and his face. Each time the fly\ntouched his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it\ndid not destroy the structure, though it knocked against the very region of\nhis face where it was rising. But besides this there was something else of\nimportance. It was something white by the door—the statue of a sphinx,\nwhich also oppressed him.\n“But perhaps that’s my shirt on the table,” he thought, “and that’s my\nlegs, and that is the door, but why is it always stretching and drawing itself\nout, and ‘piti-piti-piti’ and ‘ti-ti’ and ‘piti-piti-piti’...? That’s enough, please\nleave off!” Prince Andrew painfully entreated someone. And suddenly\nthoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar\nclearness and force.\n“Yes—love,” he thought again quite clearly. “But not love which loves\nfor something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some reason, but\nthe love which I—while dying—first experienced when I saw my enemy\nand yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love which is the very\nessence of the soul and does not require an object. Now again I feel that\nbliss. To love one’s neighbors, to love one’s enemies, to love everything, to\nlove God in all His manifestations. It is possible to love someone dear to\nyou with human love, but an enemy can only be loved by divine love. That\nis why I experienced such joy when I felt that I loved that man. What has\nbecome of him? Is he alive?...\n“When loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but\ndivine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can destroy\nit. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people have I hated in\nmy life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as I did her.” And he\nvividly pictured to himself Natásha, not as he had done in the past with\nnothing but her charms which gave him delight, but for the first time\npicturing to himself her soul. And he understood her feelings, her\nsufferings, shame, and remorse. He now understood for the first time all the\ncruelty of his rejection of her, the cruelty of his rupture with her. “If only it\nwere possible for me to see her once more! Just once, looking into those\neyes to say...”"}, {"page": 1283, "text": "“Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!” flopped the fly.... And his\nattention was suddenly carried into another world, a world of reality and\ndelirium in which something particular was happening. In that world some\nstructure was still being erected and did not fall, something was still\nstretching out, and the candle with its red halo was still burning, and the\nsame shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but besides all this something\ncreaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and a new white sphinx appeared,\nstanding at the door. And that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of\nthe very Natásha of whom he had just been thinking.\n“Oh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,” thought Prince Andrew,\ntrying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face remained before\nhim with the force of reality and drew nearer. Prince Andrew wished to\nreturn to that former world of pure thought, but he could not, and delirium\ndrew him back into its domain. The soft whispering voice continued its\nrhythmic murmur, something oppressed him and stretched out, and the\nstrange face was before him. Prince Andrew collected all his strength in an\neffort to recover his senses, he moved a little, and suddenly there was a\nringing in his ears, a dimness in his eyes, and like a man plunged into water\nhe lost consciousness. When he came to himself, Natásha, that same living\nNatásha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure\ndivine love that had been revealed to him, was kneeling before him. He\nrealized that it was the real living Natásha, and he was not surprised but\nquietly happy. Natásha, motionless on her knees (she was unable to stir),\nwith frightened eyes riveted on him, was restraining her sobs. Her face was\npale and rigid. Only in the lower part of it something quivered.\nPrince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.\n“You?” he said. “How fortunate!”\nWith a rapid but careful movement Natásha drew nearer to him on her\nknees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and began kissing\nit, just touching it lightly with her lips.\n“Forgive me!” she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him.\n“Forgive me!”\n“I love you,” said Prince Andrew.\n“Forgive...!”\n“Forgive what?” he asked."}, {"page": 1284, "text": "“Forgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!” faltered Natásha in a scarcely\naudible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more rapidly, just\ntouching it with her lips.\n“I love you more, better than before,” said Prince Andrew, lifting her face\nwith his hand so as to look into her eyes.\nThose eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly,\ncompassionately, and with joyous love. Natásha’s thin pale face, with its\nswollen lips, was more than plain—it was dreadful. But Prince Andrew did\nnot see that, he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful. They heard the\nsound of voices behind them.\nPeter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor.\nTimókhin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had long\nbeen watching all that was going on, carefully covering his bare body with\nthe sheet as he huddled up on his bench.\n“What’s this?” said the doctor, rising from his bed. “Please go away,\nmadam!”\nAt that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her\ndaughter’s absence, knocked at the door.\nLike a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Natásha went out of the\nroom and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.\nFrom that time, during all the rest of the Rostóvs’ journey, at every\nhalting place and wherever they spent a night, Natásha never left the\nwounded Bolkónski, and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected\nfrom a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded\nman.\nDreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew die\nin her daughter’s arms during the journey—as, judging by what the doctor\nsaid, it seemed might easily happen—she could not oppose Natásha.\nThough with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and\nNatásha the thought occurred that should he recover their former\nengagement would be renewed, no one—least of all Natásha and Prince\nAndrew—spoke of this: the unsettled question of life and death, which\nhung not only over Bolkónski but over all Russia, shut out all other\nconsiderations."}, {"page": 1285, "text": "CHAPTER XXXIII\nOn the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching, the\nclothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his\nbody, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had\ndone the day before. That something shameful was his yesterday’s\nconversation with Captain Ramballe.\nIt was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors.\nPierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock\nwhich Gerásim had replaced on the writing table, he remembered where he\nwas and what lay before him that very day.\n“Am I not too late?” he thought. “No, probably he won’t make his entry\ninto Moscow before noon.”\nPierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him, but\nhastened to act.\nAfter arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to go out.\nBut it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not\ncarry the weapon in his hand through the streets. It was difficult to hide\nsuch a big pistol even under his wide coat. He could not carry it unnoticed\nin his belt or under his arm. Besides, it had been discharged, and he had not\nhad time to reload it. “No matter, the dagger will do,” he said to himself,\nthough when planning his design he had more than once come to the\nconclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in 1809 had been to\ntry to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as his chief aim consisted not in\ncarrying out his design, but in proving to himself that he would not abandon\nhis intention and was doing all he could to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the\nblunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought at the Súkharev\nmarket with the pistol, and hid it under his waistcoat.\nHaving tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head,\nPierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or meeting"}, {"page": 1286, "text": "the captain, and passed out into the street.\nThe conflagration, at which he had looked with so much indifference the\nevening before, had greatly increased during the night. Moscow was on fire\nin several places. The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river, in the\nBazaar and the Povarskóy, as well as the barges on the Moskvá River and\nthe timber yards by the Dorogomílov Bridge, were all ablaze.\nPierre’s way led through side streets to the Povarskóy and from there to\nthe church of St. Nicholas on the Arbát, where he had long before decided\nthat the deed should be done. The gates of most of the houses were locked\nand the shutters up. The streets and lanes were deserted. The air was full of\nsmoke and the smell of burning. Now and then he met Russians with\nanxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of the city but of\nthe camp, walking in the middle of the streets. Both the Russians and the\nFrench looked at Pierre with surprise. Besides his height and stoutness, and\nthe strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure, the\nRussians stared at Pierre because they could not make out to what class he\ncould belong. The French followed him with astonishment in their eyes\nchiefly because Pierre, unlike all the other Russians who gazed at the\nFrench with fear and curiosity, paid no attention to them. At the gate of one\nhouse three Frenchmen, who were explaining something to some Russians\nwho did not understand them, stopped Pierre asking if he did not know\nFrench.\nPierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel\nstanding beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the shout\nwas threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man’s musket as he\nraised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the\nstreet. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him. He\ncarried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like something\ndreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous night’s experience, he was\nafraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring his mood safely to his\ndestination. And even had he not been hindered by anything on the way, his\nintention could not now have been carried out, for Napoleon had passed the\nArbát more than four hours previously on his way from the Dorogomílov\nsuburb to the Krémlin, and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind\nin a royal study in the Krémlin, giving detailed and exact orders as to\nmeasures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire, to prevent looting,"}, {"page": 1287, "text": "and to reassure the inhabitants. But Pierre did not know this; he was entirely\nabsorbed in what lay before him, and was tortured—as those are who\nobstinately undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its\ndifficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures—by the fear\nof weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.\nThough he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by\ninstinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the Povarskóy.\nAs Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser—\nhe even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose\nfrom under the roofs of the houses. He met more people in the streets and\nthey were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt that something unusual\nwas happening around him, did not realize that he was approaching the fire.\nAs he was going along a footpath across a wide-open space adjoining the\nPovarskóy on one side and the gardens of Prince Gruzínski’s house on the\nother, Pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman close to\nhim. He stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted his head.\nBy the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of household\ngoods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. On the\nground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long,\nprominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap. This woman,\nswaying to and fro and muttering something, was choking with sobs. Two\ngirls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks, were\nstaring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale frightened\nfaces. The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an overcoat and\nan immense cap evidently not his own, was crying in his old nurse’s arms.\nA dirty, barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk, and, having undone her\npale-colored plait, was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair. The\nwoman’s husband, a short, round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of\na civilian official, with sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his\nsquare-set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward over his temples, with\nexpressionless face was moving the trunks, which were placed one on\nanother, and was dragging some garments from under them.\nAs soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his feet.\n“Dear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends... help us,\nsomebody,” she muttered between her sobs. “My girl... My daughter! My"}, {"page": 1288, "text": "youngest daughter is left behind. She’s burned! Ooh! Was it for this I nursed\nyou.... Ooh!”\n“Don’t, Mary Nikoláevna!” said her husband to her in a low voice,\nevidently only to justify himself before the stranger. “Sister must have taken\nher, or else where can she be?” he added.\n“Monster! Villain!” shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to\nweep. “You have no heart, you don’t feel for your own child! Another man\nwould have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a\nman nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,” she went on,\naddressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. “The fire broke out alongside,\nand blew our way, the maid called out ‘Fire!’ and we rushed to collect our\nthings. We ran out just as we were.... This is what we have brought away....\nThe icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is lost. We seized the children.\nBut not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...” and again she began to sob. “My child, my\ndear one! Burned, burned!”\n“But where was she left?” asked Pierre.\nFrom the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man\nmight help her.\n“Oh, dear sir!” she cried, seizing him by the legs. “My benefactor, set my\nheart at ease.... Aníska, go, you horrid girl, show him the way!” she cried to\nthe maid, angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing her long\nteeth.\n“Show me the way, show me, I... I’ll do it,” gasped Pierre rapidly.\nThe dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her plait,\nsighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre felt as if he\nhad come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his head higher, his eyes\nshone with the light of life, and with swift steps he followed the maid,\novertook her, and came out on the Povarskóy. The whole street was full of\nclouds of black smoke. Tongues of flame here and there broke through that\ncloud. A great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration. In\nthe middle of the street stood a French general saying something to those\naround him. Pierre, accompanied by the maid, was advancing to the spot\nwhere the general stood, but the French soldiers stopped him.\n“On ne passe pas!” * cried a voice.\n* “You can’t pass!”"}, {"page": 1289, "text": "“This way, uncle,” cried the girl. “We’ll pass through the side street, by\nthe Nikúlins’!”\nPierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with her. She\nran across the street, turned down a side street to the left, and, passing three\nhouses, turned into a yard on the right.\n“It’s here, close by,” said she and, running across the yard, opened a gate\nin a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small wooden wing\nof the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One of its sides had\nfallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames issued from the openings of\nthe windows and from under the roof.\nAs Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air and\ninvoluntarily stopped.\n“Which is it? Which is your house?” he asked.\n“Ooh!” wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. “That’s it, that was our\nlodging. You’ve burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my precious little\nmissy! Ooh!” lamented Aníska, who at the sight of the fire felt that she too\nmust give expression to her feelings.\nPierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he involuntarily\npassed round in a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet\nburning only at one end, just below the roof, and around which swarmed a\ncrowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not realize what these men, who\nwere dragging something out, were about; but seeing before him a\nFrenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him\na fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that looting was going on there, but\nhe had no time to dwell on that idea.\nThe sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, the\nwhistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the people, and the\nsight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds and now\nsoaring up with glittering sparks, with here and there dense sheaves of\nflame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls),\nand the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced on Pierre the\nusual animating effects of a conflagration. It had a peculiarly strong effect\non him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from\nthe ideas that had weighed him down. He felt young, bright, adroit, and\nresolute. He ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash\ninto that part of it which was still standing, when just above his head he"}, {"page": 1290, "text": "heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of\nsomething heavy falling close beside him.\nPierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some\nFrenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with metal\narticles. Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer.\n“What does this fellow want?” shouted one of them referring to Pierre.\n“There’s a child in that house. Haven’t you seen a child?” cried Pierre.\n“What’s he talking about? Get along!” said several voices, and one of the\nsoldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from them some of\nthe plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved threateningly toward\nhim.\n“A child?” shouted a Frenchman from above. “I did hear something\nsquealing in the garden. Perhaps it’s his brat that the fellow is looking for.\nAfter all, one must be human, you know....”\n“Where is it? Where?” said Pierre.\n“There! There!” shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the\ngarden at the back of the house. “Wait a bit—I’m coming down.”\nAnd a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with a\nspot on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window on the\nground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the\ngarden.\n“Hurry up, you others!” he called out to his comrades. “It’s getting hot.”\nWhen they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled\nPierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a three-\nyear-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.\n“There is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!” said the Frenchman.\n“Good-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you know!” and the\nFrenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades.\nBreathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take her\nin his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly, scrofulous-looking child,\nunattractively like her mother, began to yell and run away. Pierre, however,\nseized her and lifted her in his arms.

Pierre was seized by a sense of horror and"}, {"page": 1291, "text": "repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little\nanimal. But he made an effort not to throw the child down and ran with her\nto the large house. It was now, however, impossible to get back the way he\nhad come; the maid, Aníska, was no longer there, and Pierre with a feeling\nof pity and disgust pressed the wet, painfully sobbing child to himself as\ntenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another\nway out."}, {"page": 1292, "text": "CHAPTER XXXIV\nHaving run through different yards and side streets, Pierre got back with\nhis little burden to the Gruzínski garden at the corner of the Povarskóy. He\ndid not at first recognize the place from which he had set out to look for the\nchild, so crowded was it now with people and goods that had been dragged\nout of the houses. Besides Russian families who had taken refuge here from\nthe fire with their belongings, there were several French soldiers in a variety\nof clothing. Pierre took no notice of them. He hurried to find the family of\nthat civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother and go to\nsave someone else. Pierre felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly.\nGlowing with the heat and from running, he felt at that moment more\nstrongly than ever the sense of youth, animation, and determination that had\ncome on him when he ran to save the child. She had now become quiet and,\nclinging with her little hands to Pierre’s coat, sat on his arm gazing about\nher like some little wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a slight\nsmile. He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened,\nsickly little face.\nHe did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them. He\nwalked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various faces he\nmet. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family consisting of a\nvery handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new, cloth-covered,\nsheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar type, and a young\nwoman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the perfection of Oriental\nbeauty, with her sharply outlined, arched, black eyebrows and the\nextraordinarily soft, bright color of her long, beautiful, expressionless face.\nAmid the scattered property and the crowd on the open space, she, in her\nrich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head, suggested a delicate\nexotic plant thrown out onto the snow. She was sitting on some bundles a\nlittle behind the old woman, and looked from under her long lashes with\nmotionless, large, almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. Evidently"}, {"page": 1293, "text": "she was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck Pierre\nand, hurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to look at her.\nWhen he had reached the fence, still without finding those he sought, he\nstopped and looked about him.\nWith the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than\nbefore, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered about him.\n“Have you lost anyone, my dear fellow? You’re of the gentry yourself,\naren’t you? Whose child is it?” they asked him.\nPierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who had\nbeen sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether anyone\nknew where she had gone.\n“Why, that must be the Anférovs,” said an old deacon, addressing a\npockmarked peasant woman. “Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy!” he\nadded in his customary bass.\n“The Anférovs? No,” said the woman. “They left in the morning. That\nmust be either Mary Nikoláevna’s or the Ivánovs’!”\n“He says ‘a woman,’ and Mary Nikoláevna is a lady,” remarked a house\nserf.\n“Do you know her? She’s thin, with long teeth,” said Pierre.\n“That’s Mary Nikoláevna! They went inside the garden when these\nwolves swooped down,” said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.\n“O Lord, have mercy!” added the deacon.\n“Go over that way, they’re there. It’s she! She kept on lamenting and\ncrying,” continued the woman. “It’s she. Here, this way!”\nBut Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds been\nintently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was looking at\nthe Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them.\nOne of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied round the\nwaist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were bare. The\nother, whose appearance particularly struck Pierre, was a long, lank, round-\nshouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his movements and with an idiotic\nexpression of face. He wore a woman’s loose gown of frieze, blue trousers,\nand large torn Hessian boots. The little barefooted Frenchman in the blue\ncoat went up to the Armenians and, saying something, immediately seized\nthe old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots."}, {"page": 1294, "text": "The other in the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl\nand with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and silent.\n“Here, take the child!” said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the\nwoman, handing the little girl to her. “Give her back to them, give her\nback!” he almost shouted, putting the child, who began screaming, on the\nground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the Armenian family.\nThe old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had\nsecured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other. The\nold man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre caught\nbut a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to the Frenchman in\nthe frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from side to side, had\ndrawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his pockets\nhad seized her by the neck.\nThe beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude, with\nher long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the soldier was\ndoing to her.\nWhile Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the\nFrenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing from\nher neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the young\nwoman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.\n“Let that woman alone!” exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious voice,\nseizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside.\nThe soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing down\nthe boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward Pierre.\n“Voyons, pas de bêtises!” * he cried.\n* “Look here, no nonsense!”\nPierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and his\nstrength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman and,\nbefore the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked him off his feet and\nhammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval were heard from the crowd\naround, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French Uhlans\nappeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to Pierre and\nthe Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing of what\nhappened after that. He only remembered beating someone and being"}, {"page": 1295, "text": "beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of\nFrench soldiers stood around him and were searching him.\n“Lieutenant, he has a dagger,” were the first words Pierre understood.\n“Ah, a weapon?” said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier\nwho had been arrested with Pierre. “All right, you can tell all about it at the\ncourt-martial.” Then he turned to Pierre. “Do you speak French?”\nPierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His face\nprobably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in a whisper\nand four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of\nPierre.\n“Do you speak French?” the officer asked again, keeping at a distance\nfrom Pierre. “Call the interpreter.”\nA little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and by\nhis clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a French\nsalesman from one of the Moscow shops.\n“He does not look like a common man,” said the interpreter, after a\nsearching look at Pierre.\n“Ah, he looks very much like an incendiary,” remarked the officer. “And\nask him who he is,” he added.\n“Who are you?” asked the interpreter in poor Russian. “You must answer\nthe chief.”\n“I will not tell you who I am. I am your prisoner—take me!” Pierre\nsuddenly replied in French.\n“Ah, ah!” muttered the officer with a frown. “Well then, march!”\nA crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood the\npockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol started\nshe moved forward.\n“Where are they taking you to, you poor dear?” said she. “And the little\ngirl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if she’s not theirs?” said the\nwoman.\n“What does that woman want?” asked the officer.\nPierre was as if intoxicated.

After marching through a number of streets the patrol\narrested five more Russian suspects: a small shopkeeper, two seminary\nstudents, a peasant, and a house serf, besides several looters. But of all these\nvarious suspected characters, Pierre was considered to be the most\nsuspicious of all.

But the calm,\nluxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about phantoms and reflections\nof real life, went on in its old way and made it hard, except by a great effort,\nto realize the danger and the difficult position of the Russian people. There\nwere the same receptions and balls, the same French theater, the same court\ninterests and service interests and intrigues as usual. Only in the very\nhighest circles were attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the\nactual position. Stories were whispered of how differently the two\nEmpresses behaved in these difficult circumstances. The Empress Márya,\nconcerned for the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions\nunder her patronage, had given directions that they should all be removed to\nKazán, and the things belonging to these institutions had already been\npacked up. The Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what instructions\nshe would be pleased to give—with her characteristic Russian patriotism\nhad replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for that\nwas the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she personally was concerned\nshe would be the last to quit Petersburg.\nAt Anna Pávlovna’s on the twenty-sixth of August, the very day of the\nbattle of Borodinó, there was a soiree, the chief feature of which was to be\nthe reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when sending the\nEmperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was regarded as a model of\necclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince Vasíli himself, famed for his\nelocution, was to read it. (He used to read at the Empress’.) The art of his\nreading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite independently of\ntheir meaning, in a loud and singsong voice alternating between a\ndespairing wail and a tender murmur, so that the wail fell quite at random\non one word and the murmur on another. This reading, as was always the"}, {"page": 1300, "text": "case at Anna Pávlovna’s soirees, had a political significance. That evening\nshe expected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of\ntheir visits to the French theater and aroused to a patriotic temper. A good\nmany people had already arrived, but Anna Pávlovna, not yet seeing all\nthose whom she wanted in her drawing room, did not let the reading begin\nbut wound up the springs of a general conversation.\nThe news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess\nBezúkhova. She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, had\nmissed several gatherings of which she was usually the ornament, and was\nsaid to be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors\nwho usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor who\nwas treating her in some new and unusual way.\nThey all knew very well that the enchanting countess’ illness arose from\nan inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time,\nand that the Italian’s cure consisted in removing such inconvenience; but in\nAnna Pávlovna’s presence no one dared to think of this or even appear to\nknow it.\n“They say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is angina\npectoris.”\n“Angina? Oh, that’s a terrible illness!”\n“They say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...” and the\nword angina was repeated with great satisfaction.\n“The count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the doctor\ntold him the case was dangerous.”\n“Oh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.”\n“You are speaking of the poor countess?” said Anna Pávlovna, coming up\njust then. “I sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little better. Oh, she\nis certainly the most charming woman in the world,” she went on, with a\nsmile at her own enthusiasm. “We belong to different camps, but that does\nnot prevent my esteeming her as she deserves. She is very unfortunate!”\nadded Anna Pávlovna.\nSupposing that by these words Anna Pávlovna was somewhat lifting the\nveil from the secret of the countess’ malady, an unwary young man\nventured to express surprise that well-known doctors had not been called in"}, {"page": 1301, "text": "and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might employ\ndangerous remedies.\n“Your information may be better than mine,” Anna Pávlovna suddenly\nand venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man, “but I know on\ngood authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man. He is private\nphysician to the Queen of Spain.”\nAnd having thus demolished the young man, Anna Pávlovna turned to\nanother group where Bilíbin was talking about the Austrians: having\nwrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again and\nutter one of his mots.\n“I think it is delightful,” he said, referring to a diplomatic note that had\nbeen sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners captured from the French\nby Wittgenstein, “the hero of Petropol” as he was then called in Petersburg.\n“What? What’s that?” asked Anna Pávlovna, securing silence for the mot,\nwhich she had heard before.\nAnd Bilíbin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch, which\nhe had himself composed.\n“The Emperor returns these Austrian banners,” said Bilíbin, “friendly\nbanners gone astray and found on a wrong path,” and his brow became\nsmooth again.\n“Charming, charming!” observed Prince Vasíli.\n“The path to Warsaw, perhaps,” Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly and\nunexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding what he meant.\nPrince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise. He knew no\nmore than the others what his words meant. During his diplomatic career he\nhad more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very\nwitty, and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words that\nentered his head. “It may turn out very well,” he thought, “but if not, they’ll\nknow how to arrange matters.” And really, during the awkward silence that\nensued, that insufficiently patriotic person entered whom Anna Pávlovna\nhad been waiting for and wished to convert, and she, smiling and shaking a\nfinger at Hippolyte, invited Prince Vasíli to the table and bringing him two\ncandles and the manuscript begged him to begin. Everyone became silent.\n“Most Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!” Prince Vasíli sternly\ndeclaimed, looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone"}, {"page": 1302, "text": "had anything to say to the contrary. But no one said anything. “Moscow, our\nancient capital, the New Jerusalem, receives her Christ”—he placed a\nsudden emphasis on the word her—“as a mother receives her zealous sons\ninto her arms, and through the gathering mists, foreseeing the brilliant glory\nof thy rule, sings in exultation, ‘Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh!’”\nPrince Vasíli pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.\nBilíbin attentively examined his nails, and many of those present\nappeared intimidated, as if asking in what they were to blame. Anna\nPávlovna whispered the next words in advance, like an old woman\nmuttering the prayer at Communion: “Let the bold and insolent Goliath...”\nshe whispered.\nPrince Vasíli continued.\n“Let the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass\nthe realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble Faith, the sling of\nthe Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty pride.\nThis icon of the Venerable Sergius, the servant of God and zealous\nchampion of old of our country’s weal, is offered to Your Imperial Majesty.\nI grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most\ngracious presence. I raise fervent prayers to Heaven that the Almighty may\nexalt the race of the just, and mercifully fulfill the desires of Your Majesty.”\n“What force! What a style!” was uttered in approval both of reader and of\nauthor.\nAnimated by that address Anna Pávlovna’s guests talked for a long time\nof the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the result\nof the battle to be fought in a few days.\n“You will see,” said Anna Pávlovna, “that tomorrow, on the Emperor’s\nbirthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable presentiment!”"}, {"page": 1303, "text": "CHAPTER II\nAnna Pávlovna’s presentiment was in fact fulfilled. Next day during the\nservice at the palace church in honor of the Emperor’s birthday, Prince\nVolkónski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from Prince\nKutúzov. It was Kutúzov’s report, written from Tatárinova on the day of the\nbattle. Kutúzov wrote that the Russians had not retreated a step, that the\nFrench losses were much heavier than ours, and that he was writing in haste\nfrom the field of battle before collecting full information. It followed that\nthere must have been a victory. And at once, without leaving the church,\nthanks were rendered to the Creator for His help and for the victory.\nAnna Pávlovna’s presentiment was justified, and all that morning a\njoyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the victory to\nhave been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleon’s having been\ncaptured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new ruler for France.\nIt is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and\ncompleteness amid the conditions of court life and far from the scene of\naction. General events involuntarily group themselves around some\nparticular incident. So now the courtiers’ pleasure was based as much on the\nfact that the news had arrived on the Emperor’s birthday as on the fact of\nthe victory itself. It was like a successfully arranged surprise. Mention was\nmade in Kutúzov’s report of the Russian losses, among which figured the\nnames of Túchkov, Bagratión, and Kutáysov. In the Petersburg world this\nsad side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single incident:\nKutáysov’s death. Everybody knew him, the Emperor liked him, and he was\nyoung and interesting. That day everyone met with the words:\n“What a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a loss\nKutáysov is! How sorry I am!”\n“What did I tell about Kutúzov?” Prince Vasíli now said with a prophet’s\npride. “I always said he was the only man capable of defeating Napoleon.”"}, {"page": 1304, "text": "But next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew\nanxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense\noccasioned the Emperor.\n“Fancy the Emperor’s position!” said they, and instead of extolling\nKutúzov as they had done the day before, they condemned him as the cause\nof the Emperor’s anxiety. That day Prince Vasíli no longer boasted of his\nprotégé Kutúzov, but remained silent when the commander in chief was\nmentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if everything conspired to make\nPetersburg society anxious and uneasy, a terrible piece of news was added.\nCountess Hélène Bezúkhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it\nhad been so agreeable to mention. Officially, at large gatherings, everyone\nsaid that Countess Bezúkhova had died of a terrible attack of angina\npectoris, but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private\nphysician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed small doses of a certain\ndrug to produce a certain effect; but Hélène, tortured by the fact that the old\ncount suspected her and that her husband to whom she had written (that\nwretched, profligate Pierre) had not replied, had suddenly taken a very large\ndose of the drug, and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered\nher. It was said that Prince Vasíli and the old count had turned upon the\nItalian, but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate\ndeceased that they had immediately let the matter drop.\nTalk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperor’s\nlack of news, the loss of Kutáysov, and the death of Hélène.\nOn the third day after Kutúzov’s report a country gentleman arrived from\nMoscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French spread\nthrough the whole town. This was terrible! What a position for the Emperor\nto be in! Kutúzov was a traitor, and Prince Vasíli during the visits of\ncondolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter’s death said of\nKutúzov, whom he had formerly praised (it was excusable for him in his\ngrief to forget what he had said), that it was impossible to expect anything\nelse from a blind and depraved old man.\n“I only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such a\nman.”\nAs long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it, but\nthe next day the following communication was received from Count\nRostopchín:"}, {"page": 1305, "text": "Prince Kutúzov’s adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands\npolice officers to guide the army to the Ryazán road.

Russia will shudder to learn of the\nabandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in which lie\nthe ashes of your ancestors! I shall follow the army. I have had everything\nremoved, and it only remains for me to weep over the fate of my fatherland.\nOn receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volkónski to Kutúzov\nwith the following rescript:\nPrince Michael Ilariónovich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have\nreceived no communication from you, yet on the first of September I\nreceived from the commander in chief of Moscow, via Yaroslávl, the sad\nnews that you, with the army, have decided to abandon Moscow. You can\nyourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your silence\nincreases my astonishment. I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince\nVolkónski, to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons that\nhave induced you to take this melancholy decision."}, {"page": 1306, "text": "CHAPTER III\nNine days after the abandonment of Moscow, a messenger from Kutúzov\nreached Petersburg with the official announcement of that event. This\nmessenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know Russian, but who\nwas quoique étranger, russe de cœur et d’âme, * as he said of himself.\n* Though a foreigner, Russian in heart and soul.\nThe Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace\non Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow before the\ncampaign and who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply moved (as he\nwrote) when he appeared before notre très gracieux souverain * with the\nnews of the burning of Moscow, dont les flammes éclairaient sa route. *(2)\n* Our most gracious sovereign.\n* (2) Whose flames illumined his route.\nThough the source of M. Michaud’s chagrin must have been different\nfrom that which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face when\nshown into the Emperor’s study that the latter at once asked:\n“Have you brought me sad news, Colonel?”\n“Very sad, sire,” replied Michaud, lowering his eyes with a sigh. “The\nabandonment of Moscow.”\n“Have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?” asked the\nEmperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.\nMichaud respectfully delivered the message Kutúzov had entrusted to\nhim, which was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow, and\nthat as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as\nMoscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal had to choose the latter.\nThe Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud."}, {"page": 1307, "text": "“Has the enemy entered the city?” he asked.\n“Yes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I left it all in flames,” replied\nMichaud in a decided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he was frightened\nby what he had done.\nThe Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip\ntrembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.\nBut this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if blaming\nhimself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in a firm\nvoice:\n“I see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence requires great\nsacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself in all things to His will; but\ntell me, Michaud, how did you leave the army when it saw my ancient\ncapital abandoned without a battle? Did you not notice discouragement?...”\nSeeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud also\ngrew calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperor’s direct\nand relevant question which required a direct answer.\n“Sire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?” he\nasked to gain time.\n“Colonel, I always require it,” replied the Emperor. “Conceal nothing\nfrom me, I wish to know absolutely how things are.”\n“Sire!” said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible smile on his lips,\nhaving now prepared a well-phrased reply, “sire, I left the whole army, from\nits chiefs to the lowest soldier, without exception in desperate and agonized\nterror...”\n“How is that?” the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. “Would\nmisfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!”\nMichaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had prepared.\n“Sire,” he said, with respectful playfulness, “they are only afraid lest\nYour Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should allow yourself to be\npersuaded to make peace. They are burning for the combat,” declared this\nrepresentative of the Russian nation, “and to prove to Your Majesty by the\nsacrifice of their lives how devoted they are....”\n“Ah!” said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his eyes,\nhe patted Michaud on the shoulder. “You set me at ease, Colonel.”"}, {"page": 1308, "text": "He bent his head and was silent for some time.\n“Well, then, go back to the army,” he said, drawing himself up to his full\nheight and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture, “and\ntell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that when I\nhave not a soldier left I shall put myself at the head of my beloved nobility\nand my good peasants and so use the last resources of my empire. It still\noffers me more than my enemies suppose,” said the Emperor growing more\nand more animated; “but should it ever be ordained by Divine Providence,”\nhe continued, raising to heaven his fine eyes shining with emotion, “that my\ndynasty should cease to reign on the throne of my ancestors, then after\nexhausting all the means at my command, I shall let my beard grow to here”\n(he pointed halfway down his chest) “and go and eat potatoes with the\nmeanest of my peasants, rather than sign the disgrace of my country and of\nmy beloved people whose sacrifices I know how to appreciate.”\nHaving uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly\nturned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his eyes, and\nwent to the further end of his study. Having stood there a few moments, he\nstrode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow with a\nvigorous movement. The Emperor’s mild and handsome face was flushed\nand his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.\n“Colonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, perhaps we may\nrecall it with pleasure someday... Napoleon or I,” said the Emperor,\ntouching his breast. “We can no longer both reign together. I have learned to\nknow him, and he will not deceive me any more....”\nAnd the Emperor paused, with a frown.\nWhen he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in\nthe Emperor’s eyes, Michaud—quoique étranger, russe de cœur et d’âme,\n—at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard (as\nhe used afterwards to say), and gave expression to his own feelings and\nthose of the Russian people whose representative he considered himself to\nbe, in the following words:\n“Sire!” said he, “Your Majesty is at this moment signing the glory of the\nnation and the salvation of Europe!”\nWith an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him."}, {"page": 1309, "text": "CHAPTER IV\nIt is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that when\nhalf Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to distant\nprovinces, and one levy after another was being raised for the defense of the\nfatherland, all Russians from the greatest to the least were solely engaged in\nsacrificing themselves, saving their fatherland, or weeping over its\ndownfall. The tales and descriptions of that time without exception speak\nonly of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion, despair, grief, and the heroism\nof the Russians. But it was not really so. It appears so to us because we see\nonly the general historic interest of that time and do not see all the personal\nhuman interests that people had. Yet in reality those personal interests of the\nmoment so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent\nthe public interest from being felt or even noticed. Most of the people at\nthat time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were guided\nonly by their private interests, and they were the very people whose\nactivities at that period were most useful.\nThose who tried to understand the general course of events and to take\npart in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members of\nsociety, they saw everything upside down, and all they did for the common\ngood turned out to be useless and foolish—like Pierre’s and Mamónov’s\nregiments which looted Russian villages, and the lint the young ladies\nprepared and that never reached the wounded, and so on.

In Petersburg and in the\nprovinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and gentlemen in militia\nuniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of self-sacrifice\nand so on; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow there was little\ntalk or thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight of its burned ruins\nno one swore to be avenged on the French, but they thought about their next\npay, their next quarters, of Matrëshka the vivandière, and like matters.\nAs the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rostóv took a close\nand prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so casually,\nwithout any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked at what was going\non in Russia without despair and without dismally racking his brains over it.\nHad he been asked what he thought of the state of Russia, he would have\nsaid that it was not his business to think about it, that Kutúzov and others\nwere there for that purpose, but that he had heard that the regiments were to\nbe made up to their full strength, that fighting would probably go on for a\nlong time yet, and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in\ncommand of a regiment in a couple of years’ time.\nAs he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being sent\nto Vorónezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without regret at\nbeing prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but with the greatest\npleasure—which he did not conceal and which his comrades fully\nunderstood.\nA few days before the battle of Borodinó, Nicholas received the\nnecessary money and warrants, and having sent some hussars on in\nadvance, he set out with post horses for Vorónezh.\nOnly a man who has experienced it—that is, has passed some months\ncontinuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war—can understand\nthe delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the\narmy’s foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals. When—free\nfrom soldiers, wagons, and the filthy traces of a camp—he saw villages\nwith peasants and peasant women, gentlemen’s country houses, fields\nwhere cattle were grazing, posthouses with stationmasters asleep in them,\nhe rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time.

He received\nNicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically military) and\nquestioned him with an important air, as if considering the general progress\nof affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do so. Nicholas\nwas in such good spirits that this merely amused him.\nFrom the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. The\ngovernor was a brisk little man, very simple and affable. He indicated the\nstud farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended to him a\nhorse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who\nhad the best horses, and promised to assist him in every way.\n“You are Count Ilyá Rostóv’s son? My wife was a great friend of your\nmother’s. We are at home on Thursdays—today is Thursday, so please come\nand see us quite informally,” said the governor, taking leave of him.\nImmediately on leaving the governor’s, Nicholas hired post horses and,\ntaking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop to the\nlandowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything seemed to\nhim pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in Vorónezh and, as\nusually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind, everything went\nwell and easily.\nThe landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old\ncavalryman, a horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some century-old\nbrandy and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery where he\nsmoked, and who owned some splendid horses.\nIn very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six\nthousand rubles—to serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts.

Among the men was an Italian prisoner, an officer of the\nFrench army; and Nicholas felt that the presence of that prisoner enhanced\nhis own importance as a Russian hero. The Italian was, as it were, a war\ntrophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed to him that everyone regarded the\nItalian in the same light, and he treated him cordially though with dignity\nand restraint.\nAs soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing around him\na fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the words “better late than\nnever” and heard them repeated several times by others, people clustered\naround him; all eyes turned on him, and he felt at once that he had entered\ninto his proper position in the province—that of a universal favorite: a very\npleasant position, and intoxicatingly so after his long privations. At posting\nstations, at inns, and in the landowner’s snuggery, maidservants had been\nflattered by his notice, and here too at the governor’s party there were (as it\nseemed to Nicholas) an inexhaustible number of pretty young women,\nmarried and unmarried, impatiently awaiting his notice.

Among these was the governor’s wife herself, who welcomed Rostóv\nas a near relative and called him “Nicholas.”\nCatherine Petróvna did actually play valses and the écossaise, and\ndancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial\nsociety by his agility. His particularly free manner of dancing even\nsurprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he\ndanced that evening. He had never danced like that in Moscow and would\neven have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad\nform, but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something\nunusual, something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the\ncapital though new to them in the provinces.\nAll the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and\npleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials. With the\nnaïve conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men’s wives\nwere created for them, Rostóv did not leave the lady’s side and treated her\nhusband in a friendly and conspiratorial style, as if, without speaking of it,\nthey knew how capitally Nicholas and the lady would get on together. The\nhusband, however, did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave\nmorosely with Rostóv. But the latter’s good-natured naïveté was so\nboundless that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to Nicholas’ good\nhumor. Toward the end of the evening, however, as the wife’s face grew\nmore flushed and animated, the husband’s became more and more\nmelancholy and solemn, as though there were but a given amount of\nanimation between them and as the wife’s share increased the husband’s\ndiminished."}, {"page": 1314, "text": "CHAPTER V\nNicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair, bending closely\nover the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a smile\nthat never left his face. Jauntily shifting the position of his legs in their tight\nriding breeches, diffusing an odor of perfume, and admiring his partner,\nhimself, and the fine outlines of his legs in their well-fitting Hessian boots,\nNicholas told the blonde lady that he wished to run away with a certain lady\nhere in Vorónezh.\n“Which lady?”\n“A charming lady, a divine one. Her eyes” (Nicholas looked at his\npartner) “are blue, her mouth coral and ivory; her figure” (he glanced at her\nshoulders) “like Diana’s....”\nThe husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking\nabout.\n“Ah, Nikíta Iványch!” cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if wishing\nNikíta Iványch to share his joke, he began to tell him of his intention to\nelope with a blonde lady.\nThe husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governor’s good-\nnatured wife came up with a look of disapproval.\n“Anna Ignátyevna wants to see you, Nicholas,” said she, pronouncing the\nname so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna Ignátyevna was a very\nimportant person. “Come, Nicholas! You know you let me call you so?”\n“Oh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?”\n“Anna Ignátyevna Malvíntseva. She has heard from her niece how you\nrescued her....

Oh, what a fellow you are!”\nThe governor’s wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a\nblue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with the most\nimportant personages of the town. This was Malvíntseva, Princess Mary’s\naunt on her mother’s side, a rich, childless widow who always lived in\nVorónezh. When Rostóv approached her she was standing settling up for the\ngame. She looked at him and, screwing up her eyes sternly, continued to\nupbraid the general who had won from her.\n“Very pleased, mon cher,” she then said, holding out her hand to\nNicholas. “Pray come and see me.”\nAfter a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom\nMalvíntseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas knew\nof Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the important\nold lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see\nher.\nNicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the\nmention of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of\nfear, which he himself did not understand.\nWhen he had parted from Malvíntseva Nicholas wished to return to the\ndancing, but the governor’s little wife placed her plump hand on his sleeve\nand, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to her sitting\nroom, from which those who were there immediately withdrew so as not to\nbe in her way.\n“Do you know, dear boy,” began the governor’s wife with a serious\nexpression on her kind little face, “that really would be the match for you:\nwould you like me to arrange it?”\n“Whom do you mean, Aunt?” asked Nicholas.\n“I will make a match for you with the princess.

What a charming girl she is, really!\nAnd she is not at all so plain, either.”\n“Not at all,” replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. “As befits a\nsoldier, Aunt, I don’t force myself on anyone or refuse anything,” he said\nbefore he had time to consider what he was saying."}, {"page": 1316, "text": "“Well then, remember, this is not a joke!”\n“Of course not!”\n“Yes, yes,” the governor’s wife said as if talking to herself. “But, my dear\nboy, among other things you are too attentive to the other, the blonde.

Come, let’s sit down here,” said she.\nNicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate\nthoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or his\nfriend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he afterwards\nrecalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which had\nvery important results for him, it seemed to him—as it seems to everyone in\nsuch cases—that it was merely some silly whim that seized him: yet that\nburst of frankness, together with other trifling events, had immense\nconsequences for him and for all his family.\n“You see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but the\nvery idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.”\n“Oh yes, I understand,” said the governor’s wife.\n“But Princess Bolkónskaya—that’s another matter. I will tell you the\ntruth.

And what sort of life would\nit be for Sónya—if she’s a girl with a heart? Your mother in despair, and\nyou all ruined.... No, my dear, you and Sónya ought to understand that.”\nNicholas remained silent. It comforted him to hear these arguments.\n“All the same, Aunt, it is impossible,” he rejoined with a sigh, after a\nshort pause. “Besides, would the princess have me? And besides, she is now\nin mourning. How can one think of it!”\n“But you don’t suppose I’m going to get you married at once?

She was sad. Now, after a month passed in quiet surroundings,\nshe felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which was associated in\nher mind with the ruin of Russia. She was agitated and incessantly tortured\nby the thought of the dangers to which her brother, the only intimate person\nnow remaining to her, was exposed. She was worried too about her\nnephew’s education for which she had always felt herself incompetent, but\nin the depths of her soul she felt at peace—a peace arising from\nconsciousness of having stifled those personal dreams and hopes that had\nbeen on the point of awakening within her and were related to her meeting\nwith Rostóv.\nThe day after her party the governor’s wife came to see Malvíntseva and,\nafter discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked that though under present\ncircumstances a formal betrothal was, of course, not to be thought of, all the\nsame the young people might be brought together and could get to know\none another. Malvíntseva expressed approval, and the governor’s wife\nbegan to speak of Rostóv in Mary’s presence, praising him and telling how\nhe had blushed when Princess Mary’s name was mentioned. But Princess\nMary experienced a painful rather than a joyful feeling—her mental\ntranquillity was destroyed, and desires, doubts, self-reproach, and hopes\nreawoke.\nDuring the two days that elapsed before Rostóv called, Princess Mary\ncontinually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she decided"}, {"page": 1319, "text": "not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt—that it\nwould not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to receive visitors; then\nshe thought this would be rude after what he had done for her; then it\noccurred to her that her aunt and the governor’s wife had intentions\nconcerning herself and Rostóv—their looks and words at times seemed to\nconfirm this supposition—then she told herself that only she, with her sinful\nnature, could think this of them: they could not forget that situated as she\nwas, while still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking would be an\ninsult to her and to her father’s memory. Assuming that she did go down to\nsee him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say to her and what\nshe would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly\ncold and then to mean too much. More than anything she feared lest the\nconfusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she saw\nhim.\nBut when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing\nroom that Count Rostóv had called, the princess showed no confusion, only\na slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new and radiant\nlight.\n“You have met him, Aunt?” said she in a calm voice, unable herself to\nunderstand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.\nWhen Rostóv entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an\ninstant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then just as\nNicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with shining\neyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose with a smile\nof pleasure, held out her slender, delicate hand to him, and began to speak\nin a voice in which for the first time new deep womanly notes vibrated.\nMademoiselle Bourienne, who was in the drawing room, looked at Princess\nMary in bewildered surprise. Herself a consummate coquette, she could not\nhave maneuvered better on meeting a man she wished to attract.\n“Either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly\nimproved without my having noticed it. And above all, what tact and\ngrace!” thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.\nHad Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she would\nhave been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the change that\nhad taken place in herself.

From the time Rostóv entered, her face became\nsuddenly transformed. It was as if a light had been kindled in a carved and\npainted lantern and the intricate, skillful, artistic work on its sides, that\npreviously seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless, was suddenly shown up\nin unexpected and striking beauty. For the first time all that pure, spiritual,\ninward travail through which she had lived appeared on the surface. All her\ninward labor, her dissatisfaction with herself, her sufferings, her strivings\nafter goodness, her meekness, love, and self-sacrifice—all this now shone\nin those radiant eyes, in her delicate smile, and in every trait of her gentle\nface.\nRostóv saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He felt\nthat the being before him was quite different from, and better than, anyone\nhe had met before, and above all better than himself.\nTheir conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of the\nwar, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about\nit; they spoke of their last meeting—Nicholas trying to change the subject—\nthey talked of the governor’s kind wife, of Nicholas’ relations, and of\nPrincess Mary’s.\nShe did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as soon as\nher aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of Russia’s\nmisfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was too near her\nheart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him. Nicholas\nnoticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess Mary’s character with an\nobservation unusual to him, and everything confirmed his conviction that\nshe was a quite unusual and extraordinary being. Nicholas blushed and was\nconfused when people spoke to him about the princess (as she did when he\nwas mentioned) and even when he thought of her, but in her presence he felt\nquite at ease, and said not at all what he had prepared, but what, quite\nappropriately, occurred to him at the moment.\nWhen a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is usual when\nthere are children, turned to Prince Andrew’s little son, caressing him and\nasking whether he would like to be an hussar. He took the boy on his knee,\nplayed with him, and looked round at Princess Mary. With a softened,\nhappy, timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of the man she\nloved. Nicholas also noticed that look and, as if understanding it, flushed\nwith pleasure and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness."}, {"page": 1321, "text": "As she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society, and\nNicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but all the same\nthe governor’s wife went on with her matchmaking, passing on to Nicholas\nthe flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice versa, and insisting\non his declaring himself to Princess Mary. For this purpose she arranged a\nmeeting between the young people at the bishop’s house before Mass.\nThough Rostóv told the governor’s wife that he would not make any\ndeclaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.\nAs at Tilsit Rostóv had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody\nconsidered right was right, so now, after a short but sincere struggle\nbetween his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice, and in\nobedient submission to circumstances, he chose the latter and yielded to the\npower he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where. He knew that\nafter his promise to Sónya it would be what he deemed base to declare his\nfeelings to Princess Mary. And he knew that he would never act basely. But\nhe also knew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart) that by resigning\nhimself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were guiding\nhim, he was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing something very\nimportant—more important than anything he had ever done in his life.\nAfter meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on\nexternally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for him and\nhe often thought about her. But he never thought about her as he had\nthought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met in\nsociety, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time rapturously, thought\nabout Sónya. He had pictured each of those young ladies as almost all\nhonest-hearted young men do, that is, as a possible wife, adapting her in his\nimagination to all the conditions of married life: a white dressing gown, his\nwife at the tea table, his wife’s carriage, little ones, Mamma and Papa, their\nrelations to her, and so on—and these pictures of the future had given him\npleasure.

The conversations he heard\nseemed to him insincere; he did not know how to judge all these affairs and\nfelt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him.\nHe made haste to finish buying the horses, and often became unreasonably\nangry with his servant and squadron quartermaster.\nA few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which\nNicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory. He\nstood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum\nthrough the service, meditating on a great variety of subjects.

It was the same face he had\nseen before, there was the same general expression of refined, inner,\nspiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up.

As had occurred before when\nshe was present, Nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by\nthe governor’s wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and\nproper to address her here in church, and told her he had heard of her\ntrouble and sympathized with his whole soul. As soon as she heard his\nvoice a vivid glow kindled in her face, lighting up both her sorrow and her\njoy.\n“There is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess,” said Rostóv. “It is that\nif your brother, Prince Andrew Nikoláevich, were not living, it would have\nbeen at once announced in the Gazette, as he is a colonel.”\nThe princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but cheered\nby the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.\n“And I have known so many cases of a splinter wound” (the Gazette said\nit was a shell) “either proving fatal at once or being very slight,” continued\nNicholas. “We must hope for the best, and I am sure...”\nPrincess Mary interrupted him.\n“Oh, that would be so dread...” she began and, prevented by agitation\nfrom finishing, she bent her head with a movement as graceful as\neverything she did in his presence and, looking up at him gratefully, went\nout, following her aunt.\nThat evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle some\naccounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that business it was\nalready too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed, and for a\nlong time he paced up and down the room, reflecting on his life, a thing he\nrarely did.\nPrincess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had\nmet her in Smolénsk province.

But that day’s encounter in church had,\nhe felt, sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale, sad,\nrefined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures, and especially\nthe deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and\nevoked his sympathy. In men Rostóv could not bear to see the expression of\na higher spiritual life (that was why he did not like Prince Andrew) and he\nreferred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess, but in Princess\nMary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world\nforeign to him was an irresistible attraction.\n“She must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!” he said to himself.\n“Why am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with Sónya?” And he\ninvoluntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one and the\nabundance of it in the other—a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore\nvalued most highly. He tried to picture what would happen were he free.\nHow he would propose to her and how she would become his wife. But no,\nhe could not imagine that. He felt awed, and no clear picture presented itself\nto his mind. He had long ago pictured to himself a future with Sónya, and\nthat was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he\nknew all there was in Sónya, but it was impossible to picture a future with\nPrincess Mary, because he did not understand her but simply loved her.\nReveries about Sónya had had something merry and playful in them, but\nto dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little frightening.\n“How she prayed!” he thought. “It was plain that her whole soul was in\nher prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains, and I am sure her\nprayer will be answered. Why don’t I pray for what I want?” he suddenly\nthought. “What do I want? To be free, released from Sónya... She was\nright,” he thought, remembering what the governor’s wife had said:\n“Nothing but misfortune can come of marrying Sónya. Muddles, grief for\nMamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible muddles! Besides, I\ndon’t love her—not as I should. O, God! release me from this dreadful,\ninextricable position!” he suddenly began to pray. “Yes, prayer can move\nmountains, but one must have faith and not pray as Natásha and I used to as\nchildren, that the snow might turn into sugar—and then run out into the\nyard to see whether it had done so. No, but I am not praying for trifles\nnow,” he thought as he put his pipe down in a corner, and folding his hands\nplaced himself before the icon. Softened by memories of Princess Mary he"}, {"page": 1325, "text": "began to pray as he had not done for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and\nin his throat when the door opened and Lavrúshka came in with some\npapers.\n“Blockhead! Why do you come in without being called?” cried Nicholas,\nquickly changing his attitude.\n“From the governor,” said Lavrúshka in a sleepy voice. “A courier has\narrived and there’s a letter for you.”\n“Well, all right, thanks. You can go!”\nNicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother and the\nother from Sónya. He recognized them by the handwriting and opened\nSónya’s first. He had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his eyes\nopened wide with fear and joy.\n“No, it’s not possible!” he cried aloud.\nUnable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and\nreading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then again, and\nstanding still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders, stretching\nout his hands, with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed. What he had\njust been praying for with confidence that God would hear him had come to\npass; but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something\nextraordinary and unexpected, and as if the very fact that it had happened so\nquickly proved that it had not come from God to whom he had prayed, but\nby some ordinary coincidence.\nThis unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary letter\nfrom Sónya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which there\nhad seemed no escape. She wrote that the last unfortunate events—the loss\nof almost the whole of the Rostóvs’ Moscow property—and the countess’\nrepeatedly expressed wish that Nicholas should marry Princess\nBolkónskaya, together with his silence and coldness of late, had all\ncombined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set him\ncompletely free.\nIt would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow or\ndiscord in the family that has been so good to me (she wrote), and my love\nhas no aim but the happiness of those I love; so, Nicholas, I beg you to\nconsider yourself free, and to be assured that, in spite of everything, no one\ncan love you more than does"}, {"page": 1326, "text": "Your Sónya\nBoth letters were written from Tróitsa.

She\nknew that Sónya was the chief obstacle to this happening, and Sónya’s life\nin the countess’ house had grown harder and harder, especially after they\nhad received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting with Princess\nMary in Boguchárovo. The countess let no occasion slip of making\nhumiliating or cruel allusions to Sónya.\nBut a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all that\nwas going on, she called Sónya to her and, instead of reproaching and\nmaking demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and\nrepay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement\nwith Nicholas.\n“I shall not be at peace till you promise me this.”\nSónya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she\nwould do anything and was prepared for anything, but gave no actual\npromise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of\nher. She must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought\nher up. To sacrifice herself for others was Sónya’s habit. Her position in the\nhouse was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth, and she\nwas accustomed to this and loved doing it. But in all her former acts of self-\nsacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own\nesteem and in that of others, and so made her more worthy of Nicholas\nwhom she loved more than anything in the world. But now they wanted her\nto sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward for her self-\nsacrifice and the whole meaning of her life.

And for the\nfirst time Sónya felt that out of her pure, quiet love for Nicholas a\npassionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger than\nprinciple, virtue, or religion. Under the influence of this feeling Sónya,\nwhose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive,\nhaving answered the countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with\nher and resolved to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him\nfree but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.\nThe bustle and terror of the Rostóvs’ last days in Moscow stifled the\ngloomy thoughts that oppressed Sónya. She was glad to find escape from\nthem in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince Andrew’s presence\nin their house, despite her sincere pity for him and for Natásha, she was\nseized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God did not intend her to be\nseparated from Nicholas. She knew that Natásha loved no one but Prince\nAndrew and had never ceased to love him. She knew that being thrown\ntogether again under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in\nlove with one another, and that Nicholas would then not be able to marry\nPrincess Mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity.\nDespite all the terror of what had happened during those last days and\nduring the first days of their journey, this feeling that Providence was\nintervening in her personal affairs cheered Sónya.\nAt the Tróitsa monastery the Rostóvs first broke their journey for a whole\nday.\nThree large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry, one\nof which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much\nbetter that day and Natásha was sitting with him. In the next room sat the\ncount and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was calling\non them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery. Sónya was\nthere too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew and Natásha\nwere talking about. She heard the sound of their voices through the door.\nThat door opened and Natásha came out, looking excited. Not noticing the\nmonk, who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the wide sleeve on\nhis right arm, she went up to Sónya and took her hand.\n“Natásha, what are you about? Come here!” said the countess.\nNatásha went up to the monk for his blessing, and he advised her to pray\nfor aid to God and His saint."}, {"page": 1329, "text": "As soon as the prior withdrew, Natásha took her friend by the hand and\nwent with her into the unoccupied room.\n“Sónya, will he live?” she asked. “Sónya, how happy I am, and how\nunhappy!...

Sobbing,\nshe kissed and comforted Natásha. “If only he lives!” she thought. Having\nwept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two friends went together to\nPrince Andrew’s door. Natásha opened it cautiously and glanced into the\nroom, Sónya standing beside her at the half-open door.\nPrince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale face was\ncalm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular breathing.\n“O, Natásha!” Sónya suddenly almost screamed, catching her\ncompanion’s arm and stepping back from the door.\n“What? What is it?” asked Natásha.\n“It’s that, that...” said Sónya, with a white face and trembling lips.\nNatásha softly closed the door and went with Sónya to the window, not\nyet understanding what the latter was telling her.\n“You remember,” said Sónya with a solemn and frightened expression.\n“You remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at Otrádnoe at\nChristmas? Do you remember what I saw?”\n“Yes, yes!” cried Natásha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely recalling\nthat Sónya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom she had seen\nlying down.\n“You remember?” Sónya went on. “I saw it then and told everybody, you\nand Dunyásha. I saw him lying on a bed,” said she, making a gesture with\nher hand and a lifted finger at each detail, “and that he had his eyes closed\nand was covered just with a pink quilt, and that his hands were folded,” she\nconcluded, convincing herself that the details she had just seen were exactly\nwhat she had seen in the mirror.\nShe had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that\ncame into her head, but what she had invented then seemed to her now as"}, {"page": 1330, "text": "real as any other recollection.

Those\neyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and\nreadiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal.\nSónya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.\n“Yes, Mamma, I will write,” said she.\nSónya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred that\nday, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her vision.\nNow that she knew that the renewal of Natásha’s relations with Prince\nAndrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying Princess Mary, she was\njoyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in which she was\naccustomed to live and loved to live.

In\ntheir attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to who he\nmight be—perhaps a very important person—and hostility as a result of\ntheir recent personal conflict with him.\nBut when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the\nnew guard—both officers and men—he was not as interesting as he had\nbeen to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not\nrecognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who\nhad fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had\nuttered those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only No.\n17 of the captured Russians, arrested and detained for some reason by order\nof the Higher Command. If they noticed anything remarkable about Pierre,\nit was only his unabashed, meditative concentration and thoughtfulness, and\nthe way he spoke French, which struck them as surprisingly good. In spite\nof this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects, as the\nseparate room he had occupied was required by an officer.\nAll the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class and,\nrecognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more especially as he\nspoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him.\nThat evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among\nthem) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was taken with\nthe others to a house where a French general with a white mustache sat with\ntwo colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their arms. With the\nprecision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners, and which is\nsupposed to preclude human frailty, Pierre like the others was questioned as\nto who he was, where he had been, with what object, and so on."}, {"page": 1332, "text": "These questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the essence of\nthe matter aside, shut out the possibility of that essence’s being revealed,\nand were designed only to form a channel through which the judges wished\nthe answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to the desired result, namely\na conviction. As soon as Pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with\nthat aim, the channel was removed and the water could flow to waste. Pierre\nfelt, moreover, what the accused always feel at their trial, perplexity as to\nwhy these questions were put to him. He had a feeling that it was only out\nof condescension or a kind of civility that this device of placing a channel\nwas employed. He knew he was in these men’s power, that only by force\nhad they brought him there, that force alone gave them the right to demand\nanswers to their questions, and that the sole object of that assembly was to\ninculpate him. And so, as they had the power and wish to inculpate him, this\nexpedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary. It was evident that\nany answer would lead to conviction. When asked what he was doing when\nhe was arrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was\nrestoring to its parents a child he had saved from the flames. Why had he\nfought the marauder? Pierre answered that he “was protecting a woman,”\nand that “to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of every\nman; that...” They interrupted him, for this was not to the point. Why was\nhe in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had seen him? He replied\nthat he had gone out to see what was happening in Moscow. Again they\ninterrupted him: they had not asked where he was going, but why he was\nfound near the fire? Who was he? they asked, repeating their first question,\nwhich he had declined to answer. Again he replied that he could not answer\nit.\n“Put that down, that’s bad... very bad,” sternly remarked the general with\nthe white mustache and red flushed face.\nOn the fourth day fires broke out on the Zúbovski rampart.\nPierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchant’s\nhouse near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the streets Pierre felt\nstifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole city. Fires were\nvisible on all sides.

Evidently for them “the marshal” represented a very high and\nrather mysterious power.\nThese first days, before the eighth of September when the prisoners were\nhad up for a second examination, were the hardest of all for Pierre."}, {"page": 1334, "text": "CHAPTER X\nOn the eighth of September an officer—a very important one judging by\nthe respect the guards showed him—entered the coach house where the\nprisoners were. This officer, probably someone on the staff, was holding a\npaper in his hand, and called over all the Russians there, naming Pierre as\n“the man who does not give his name.” Glancing indolently and\nindifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered the officer in charge to have\nthem decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal. An\nhour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led\nto the Virgin’s Field. It was a fine day, sunny after rain, and the air was\nunusually pure. The smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had\nbeen taken from the guardhouse on the Zúbovski rampart, but rose through\nthe pure air in columns. No flames were seen, but columns of smoke rose\non all sides, and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast charred\nruin. On all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney\nstacks still standing, and here and there the blackened walls of some brick\nhouses. Pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had\nknown well. Here and there he could see churches that had not been burned.\nThe Krémlin, which was not destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with\nits towers and the belfry of Iván the Great. The domes of the New Convent\nof the Virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly.\nThese bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the Nativity\nof the Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday:\neverywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to be seen were\ntattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the French.\nIt was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but in place\nof the Russian order of life that had been destroyed, Pierre unconsciously\nfelt that a quite different, firm, French order had been established over this\nruined nest. He felt this in the looks of the soldiers who, marching in\nregular ranks briskly and gaily, were escorting him and the other criminals;"}, {"page": 1335, "text": "he felt it in the looks of an important French official in a carriage and pair\ndriven by a soldier, whom they met on the way. He felt it in the merry\nsounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field, and felt\nand realized it especially from the list of prisoners the French officer had\nread out when he came that morning. Pierre had been taken by one set of\nsoldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other\nmen, and it seemed that they might have forgotten him, or confused him\nwith the others. But no: the answers he had given when questioned had\ncome back to him in his designation as “the man who does not give his\nname,” and under that appellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they\nwere now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their\nfaces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted\nand that they were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself to be\nan insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he\ndid not understand but which was working well.\nHe and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virgin’s\nField, to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the\nconvent. This was Prince Shcherbátov’s house, where Pierre had often been\nin other days, and which, as he learned from the talk of the soldiers, was\nnow occupied by the marshal, the Duke of Eckmühl (Davout).\nThey were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one. Pierre\nwas the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass gallery, an\nanteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a long low study at\nthe door of which stood an adjutant.\nDavout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end of the\nroom. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently consulting a paper\nthat lay before him, did not look up. Without raising his eyes, he said in a\nlow voice:\n“Who are you?”\nPierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To him\nDavout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for his\ncruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who\nwas prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that every instant of\ndelay might cost him his life; but he did not know what to say. He did not\nventure to repeat what he had said at his first examination, yet to disclose\nhis rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing. So he was silent."}, {"page": 1336, "text": "But before he had decided what to do, Davout raised his head, pushed his\nspectacles back on his forehead, screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at\nhim.\n“I know that man,” he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently calculated\nto frighten Pierre.\nThe chill that had been running down Pierre’s back now seized his head\nas in a vise.\n“You cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...”\n“He is a Russian spy,” Davout interrupted, addressing another general\nwho was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.\nDavout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice\nPierre rapidly began:\n“No, monseigneur,” he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a\nduke. “No, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia officer\nand have not quitted Moscow.”\n“Your name?” asked Davout.\n“Bezúkhov.”\n“What proof have I that you are not lying?”\n“Monseigneur!” exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a pleading\nvoice.\nDavout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they\nlooked at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from conditions of\nwar and law, that look established human relations between the two men. At\nthat moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their\nminds, and they realized that they were both children of humanity and were\nbrothers.\nAt the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the papers\nwhere human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre was\nmerely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without burdening\nhis conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a human being. He\nreflected for a moment.\n“How can you show me that you are telling the truth?” said Davout\ncoldly."}, {"page": 1337, "text": "Pierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the\nstreet where the house was.\n“You are not what you say,” returned Davout.\nIn a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of the truth\nof his statements.\nBut at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to\nDavout.\nDavout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began\nbuttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten Pierre.\nWhen the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head in\nPierre’s direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But where\nthey were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach house or to the\nplace of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they crossed\nthe Virgin’s Field.\nHe turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another question\nto Davout.\n“Yes, of course!” replied Davout, but what this “yes” meant, Pierre did\nnot know.\nPierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was far, or\nin which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was stupefied, and\nnoticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others did till\nthey all stopped and he stopped too. The only thought in his mind at that\ntime was: who was it that had really sentenced him to death? Not the men\non the commission that had first examined him—not one of them wished to\nor, evidently, could have done it. It was not Davout, who had looked at him\nin so human a way. In another moment Davout would have realized that he\nwas doing wrong, but just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted\nhim. The adjutant, also, had evidently had no evil intent though he might\nhave refrained from coming in. Then who was executing him, killing him,\ndepriving him of life—him, Pierre, with all his memories, aspirations,\nhopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And Pierre felt that it was no\none.\nIt was a system—a concurrence of circumstances.\nA system of some sort was killing him—Pierre—depriving him of life, of\neverything, annihilating him."}, {"page": 1338, "text": "CHAPTER XI\nFrom Prince Shcherbátov’s house the prisoners were led straight down\nthe Virgin’s Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen garden in\nwhich a post had been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in\nthe ground, and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle.\nThe crowd consisted of a few Russians and many of Napoleon’s soldiers\nwho were not on duty—Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen, in a variety of\nuniforms. To the right and left of the post stood rows of French troops in\nblue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos.\nThe prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the list (Pierre\nwas sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums suddenly began to beat\non both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre felt as if part of his soul had\nbeen torn away. He lost the power of thinking or understanding. He could\nonly hear and see. And he had only one wish—that the frightful thing that\nhad to happen should happen quickly. Pierre looked round at his fellow\nprisoners and scrutinized them.\nThe two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and thin, the\nother dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was a domestic\nserf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled hair and a plump, well-\nnourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome man with a\nbroad, light-brown beard and black eyes. The fifth was a factory hand, a\nthin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat.\nPierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them separately or\ntwo at a time. “In couples,” replied the officer in command in a calm voice.\nThere was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they\nwere all hurrying—not as men hurry to do something they understand, but\nas people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible\ntask."}, {"page": 1339, "text": "A French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of\nprisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.\nThen two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the\nofficer’s command took the two convicts who stood first in the row. The\nconvicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks were being\nbrought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching\nhuntsman. One crossed himself continually, the other scratched his back\nand made a movement of the lips resembling a smile. With hurried hands\nthe soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their heads, and\nbound them to the post.\nTwelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm\nregular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned away to\navoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling noise\nwas heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific thunder, and\nhe looked round. There was some smoke, and the Frenchmen were doing\nsomething near the pit, with pale faces and trembling hands. Two more\nprisoners were led up. In the same way and with similar looks, these two\nglanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection in\ntheir eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe what was going to\nhappen to them. They could not believe it because they alone knew what\ntheir life meant to them, and so they neither understood nor believed that it\ncould be taken from them.\nAgain Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but again the\nsound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and at the same moment he\nsaw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the Frenchmen who were\nagain doing something by the post, their trembling hands impeding one\nanother. Pierre, breathing heavily, looked around as if asking what it meant.\nThe same question was expressed in all the looks that met his.\nOn the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and officers\nwithout exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and conflict that were\nin his own heart. “But who, after all, is doing this? They are all suffering as\nI am. Who then is it? Who?” flashed for an instant through his mind.\n“Sharpshooters of the 86th, forward!” shouted someone. The fifth\nprisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led away—alone. Pierre did not\nunderstand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been brought there\nonly to witness the execution.

The moment they laid hands on him he\nsprang aside in terror and clutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered and shook\nhimself free.) The lad was unable to walk. They dragged him along, holding\nhim up under the arms, and he screamed. When they got him to the post he\ngrew quiet, as if he suddenly understood something. Whether he understood\nthat screaming was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men\nshould kill him, at any rate he took his stand at the post, waiting to be\nblindfolded like the others, and like a wounded animal looked around him\nwith glittering eyes.\nPierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His curiosity\nand agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the highest pitch at this\nfifth murder. Like the others this fifth man seemed calm; he wrapped his\nloose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other.\nWhen they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which\nhurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against the\nbloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in that\nposition, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned back again more\ncomfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss his\nslightest movement.\nProbably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports\nof eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards remember\nhaving heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw how the\nworkman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how blood\nshowed itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the weight of\nthe hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head hanging\nunnaturally and one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one\nhindered him. Pale, frightened people were doing something around the\nworkman. The lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a thick mustache\ntrembled as he untied the ropes. The body collapsed. The soldiers dragged it\nawkwardly from the post and began pushing it into the pit.\nThey all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must\nhide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.\nPierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with his\nknees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other. That\nshoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively, but spadefuls of earth"}, {"page": 1341, "text": "were already being thrown over the whole body. One of the soldiers,\nevidently suffering, shouted gruffly and angrily at Pierre to go back. But\nPierre did not understand him and remained near the post, and no one drove\nhim away.\nWhen the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was taken\nback to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made a\nhalf turn and went past it at a measured pace. The twenty-four\nsharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the center of the circle,\nran back to their places as the companies passed by.\nPierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in\ncouples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies. This one, a\nyoung soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed back, and his musket\nresting on the ground, still stood near the pit at the spot from which he had\nfired. He swayed like a drunken man, taking some steps forward and back\nto save himself from falling. An old, noncommissioned officer ran out of\nthe ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to his company. The\ncrowd of Russians and Frenchmen began to disperse. They all went away\nsilently and with drooping heads.\n“That will teach them to start fires,” said one of the Frenchmen.\nPierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who was\ntrying to find some relief after what had been done, but was not able to do\nso. Without finishing what he had begun to say he made a hopeless\nmovement with his arm and went away."}, {"page": 1342, "text": "CHAPTER XII\nAfter the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners\nand placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.\nToward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers\nand told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks\nfor the prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said to him,\nPierre got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the upper end of\nthe field, where there were some sheds built of charred planks, beams, and\nbattens, and led him into one of them. In the darkness some twenty different\nmen surrounded Pierre. He looked at them without understanding who they\nwere, why they were there, or what they wanted of him. He heard what they\nsaid, but did not understand the meaning of the words and made no kind of\ndeduction from or application of them. He replied to questions they put to\nhim, but did not consider who was listening to his replies, nor how they\nwould understand them. He looked at their faces and figures, but they all\nseemed to him equally meaningless.\nFrom the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed\nby men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the mainspring of his\nlife, on which everything depended and which made everything appear\nalive, had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into a\nheap of meaningless rubbish. Though he did not acknowledge it to himself,\nhis faith in the right ordering of the universe, in humanity, in his own soul,\nand in God, had been destroyed. He had experienced this before, but never\nso strongly as now. When similar doubts had assailed him before, they had\nbeen the result of his own wrongdoing, and at the bottom of his heart he had\nfelt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be found\nwithin himself. But now he felt that the universe had crumbled before his\neyes and only meaningless ruins remained, and this not by any fault of his\nown. He felt that it was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of\nlife."}, {"page": 1343, "text": "Around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something\nabout him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and\nasking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he\nfound himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and\ntalking on all sides.\n“Well, then, mates... that very prince who...” some voice at the other end\nof the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word who.\nSitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall, Pierre\nsometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon as he closed\nthem he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory lad—especially\ndreadful because of its simplicity—and the faces of the murderers, even\nmore dreadful because of their disquiet. And he opened his eyes again and\nstared vacantly into the darkness around him.\nBeside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he\nwas first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from\nhim every time he moved. This man was doing something to his legs in the\ndarkness, and though Pierre could not see his face he felt that the man\ncontinually glanced at him. On growing used to the darkness Pierre saw that\nthe man was taking off his leg bands, and the way he did it aroused Pierre’s\ninterest.\nHaving unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he carefully\ncoiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg, glancing up at\nPierre. While one hand hung up the first string the other was already\nunwinding the band on the second leg. In this way, having carefully\nremoved the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one\nanother uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs fixed\nabove his head. Then he took out a knife, cut something, closed the knife,\nplaced it under the head of his bed, and, seating himself comfortably,\nclasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on Pierre. The\nlatter was conscious of something pleasant, comforting, and well-rounded\nin these deft movements, in the man’s well-ordered arrangements in his\ncorner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at the man without taking\nhis eyes from him.\n“You’ve seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?” the little man suddenly said.\nAnd there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice\nthat Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt tears rising to his"}, {"page": 1344, "text": "eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time to betray his confusion,\ninstantly continued in the same pleasant tones:\n“Eh, lad, don’t fret!” said he, in the tender singsong caressing voice old\nRussian peasant women employ. “Don’t fret, friend—‘suffer an hour, live\nfor an age!’ that’s how it is, my dear fellow. And here we live, thank\nheaven, without offense. Among these folk, too, there are good men as well\nas bad,” said he, and still speaking, he turned on his knees with a supple\nmovement, got up, coughed, and went off to another part of the shed.\n“Eh, you rascal!” Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other\nend of the shed. “So you’ve come, you rascal? She remembers... Now, now,\nthat’ll do!”\nAnd the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him,\nreturned to his place and sat down. In his hands he had something wrapped\nin a rag.\n“Here, eat a bit, sir,” said he, resuming his former respectful tone as he\nunwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes. “We had soup for\ndinner and the potatoes are grand!”\nPierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed\nextremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began to eat.\n“Well, are they all right?” said the soldier with a smile. “You should do\nlike this.”\nHe took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into two equal\nhalves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it from the rag, and\nhanded it to Pierre.\n“The potatoes are grand!” he said once more. “Eat some like that!”\nPierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.\n“Oh, I’m all right,” said he, “but why did they shoot those poor fellows?\nThe last one was hardly twenty.”\n“Tss, tt...!” said the little man. “Ah, what a sin... what a sin!” he added\nquickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his mouth and\nflew out involuntarily he went on: “How was it, sir, that you stayed in\nMoscow?”\n“I didn’t think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,” replied\nPierre."}, {"page": 1345, "text": "“And how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?”\n“No, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and tried me as\nan incendiary.”\n“Where there’s law there’s injustice,” put in the little man.\n“And have you been here long?” Pierre asked as he munched the last of\nthe potato.\n“I? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow.”\n“Why, are you a soldier then?”\n“Yes, we are soldiers of the Ápsheron regiment. I was dying of fever. We\nweren’t told anything. There were some twenty of us lying there. We had no\nidea, never guessed at all.”\n“And do you feel sad here?” Pierre inquired.\n“How can one help it, lad? My name is Platón, and the surname is\nKaratáev,” he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to\naddress him. “They call me ‘little falcon’ in the regiment. How is one to\nhelp feeling sad? Moscow—she’s the mother of cities. How can one see all\nthis and not feel sad? But ‘the maggot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies first’;\nthat’s what the old folks used to tell us,” he added rapidly.\n“What? What did you say?” asked Pierre.\n“Who? I?” said Karatáev. “I say things happen not as we plan but as God\njudges,” he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had said before,\nand immediately continued:\n“Well, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you have\nabundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still\nliving?” he asked.\nAnd though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed\nsmile of kindliness puckered the soldier’s lips as he put these questions. He\nseemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that he had no mother.\n“A wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there’s none as\ndear as one’s own mother!” said he. “Well, and have you little ones?” he\nwent on asking.\nAgain Pierre’s negative answer seemed to distress him, and he hastened\nto add:"}, {"page": 1346, "text": "“Never mind! You’re young folks yet, and please God may still have\nsome. The great thing is to live in harmony....”\n“But it’s all the same now,” Pierre could not help saying.\n“Ah, my dear fellow!” rejoined Karatáev, “never decline a prison or a\nbeggar’s sack!”\nHe seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently preparing to\ntell a long story.\n“Well, my dear fellow, I was still living at home,” he began. “We had a\nwell-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and our house\nwas one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing there\nwere seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so happened...”\nAnd Platón Karatáev told a long story of how he had gone into\nsomeone’s copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper, had\nbeen tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.\n“Well, lad,” and a smile changed the tone of his voice, “we thought it was\na misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been for my sin, my\nbrother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my younger brother, had\nfive little ones, while I, you see, only left a wife behind. We had a little girl,\nbut God took her before I went as a soldier. I come home on leave and I’ll\ntell you how it was, I look and see that they are living better than before.\nThe yard full of cattle, the women at home, two brothers away earning\nwages, and only Michael the youngest, at home. Father, he says, ‘All my\nchildren are the same to me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten.\nBut if Platón hadn’t been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to\ngo.’ called us all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front of the\nicons. ‘Michael,’ he says, ‘come here and bow down to his feet; and you,\nyoung woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also bow down\nbefore him! Do you understand?’ he says. That’s how it is, dear fellow. Fate\nlooks for a head. But we are always judging, ‘that’s not well—that’s not\nright!’ Our luck is like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and it bulges, but\nwhen you’ve drawn it out it’s empty! That’s how it is.”\nAnd Platón shifted his seat on the straw.\nAfter a short silence he rose.\n“Well, I think you must be sleepy,” said he, and began rapidly crossing\nhimself and repeating:"}, {"page": 1347, "text": "“Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus\nChrist, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy\non us and save us!” he concluded, then bowed to the ground, got up, sighed,\nand sat down again on his heap of straw. “That’s the way. Lay me down like\na stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf,” he muttered as he lay down,\npulling his coat over him.\n“What prayer was that you were saying?” asked Pierre.\n“Eh?” murmured Platón, who had almost fallen asleep. “What was I\nsaying? I was praying. Don’t you pray?”\n“Yes, I do,” said Pierre. “But what was that you said: Frola and Lavra?”\n“Well, of course,” replied Platón quickly, “the horses’ saints. One must\npity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now you’ve curled up and got warm,\nyou daughter of a bitch!” said Karatáev, touching the dog that lay at his\nfeet, and again turning over he fell asleep immediately.\nSounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance\noutside, and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed, but inside it\nwas quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep, but lay with eyes\nopen in the darkness, listening to the regular snoring of Platón who lay\nbeside him, and he felt that the world that had been shattered was once\nmore stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on new and unshakable\nfoundations."}, {"page": 1348, "text": "CHAPTER XIII\nTwenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were confined in\nthe shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he remained for four\nweeks.\nWhen Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures\nto him except Platón Karatáev, who always remained in his mind a most\nvivid and precious memory and the personification of everything Russian,\nkindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn the\nfirst impression of him, as of something round, was fully confirmed:\nPlatón’s whole figure—in a French overcoat girdled with a cord, a soldier’s\ncap, and bast shoes—was round. His head was quite round, his back, chest,\nshoulders, and even his arms, which he held as if ever ready to embrace\nsomething, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his large, gentle brown\neyes were also round.\nPlatón Karatáev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of campaigns\nhe had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not himself know his age\nand was quite unable to determine it. But his brilliantly white, strong teeth\nwhich showed in two unbroken semicircles when he laughed—as he often\ndid—were all sound and good, there was not a gray hair in his beard or on\nhis head, and his whole body gave an impression of suppleness and\nespecially of firmness and endurance.\nHis face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of\ninnocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief\npeculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It was evident\nthat he never considered what he had said or was going to say, and\nconsequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an irresistible\npersuasiveness.\nHis physical strength and agility during the first days of his imprisonment\nwere such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and sickness meant."}, {"page": 1349, "text": "Every night before lying down, he said: “Lord, lay me down as a stone and\nraise me up as a loaf!” and every morning on getting up, he said: “I lay\ndown and curled up, I get up and shake myself.” And indeed he only had to\nlie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he only had to shake himself, to be\nready without a moment’s delay for some work, just as children are ready to\nplay directly they awake. He could do everything, not very well but not\nbadly. He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, and mended boots. He was always\nbusy, and only at night allowed himself conversation—of which he was\nfond—and songs. He did not sing like a trained singer who knows he is\nlistened to, but like the birds, evidently giving vent to the sounds in the\nsame way that one stretches oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness,\nand the sounds were always high-pitched, mournful, delicate, and almost\nfeminine, and his face at such times was very serious.\nHaving been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, he seemed to\nhave thrown off all that had been forced upon him—everything military and\nalien to himself—and had returned to his former peasant habits.\n“A soldier on leave—a shirt outside breeches,” he would say.\nHe did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did not\ncomplain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during the\nwhole of his army service. When he related anything it was generally some\nold and evidently precious memory of his “Christian” life, as he called his\npeasant existence. The proverbs, of which his talk was full, were for the\nmost part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ, but those folk\nsayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant, but when used\nappositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom.\nHe would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous\noccasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk and he talked well,\nadorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which\nPierre thought he invented himself, but the chief charm of his talk lay in the\nfact that the commonest events—sometimes just such as Pierre had\nwitnessed without taking notice of them—assumed in Karatáev’s a\ncharacter of solemn fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales one of the\nsoldiers used to tell of an evening (they were always the same), but most of\nall he liked to hear stories of real life. He would smile joyfully when\nlistening to such stories, now and then putting in a word or asking a\nquestion to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself."}, {"page": 1350, "text": "Karatáev had no attachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre understood\nthem, but loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in\ncontact with, particularly with man—not any particular man, but those with\nwhom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his comrades, the French, and\nPierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt that in spite of Karatáev’s\naffectionate tenderness for him (by which he unconsciously gave Pierre’s\nspiritual life its due) he would not have grieved for a moment at parting\nfrom him. And Pierre began to feel in the same way toward Karatáev.\nTo all the other prisoners Platón Karatáev seemed a most ordinary\nsoldier. They called him “little falcon” or “Platósha,” chaffed him good-\nnaturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre he always remained what\nhe had seemed that first night: an unfathomable, rounded, eternal\npersonification of the spirit of simplicity and truth.\nPlatón Karatáev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. When he\nbegan to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.\nSometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would ask him to\nrepeat them, but Platón could never recall what he had said a moment\nbefore, just as he never could repeat to Pierre the words of his favorite song:\nnative and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in it, but when spoken\nand not sung, no meaning could be got out of it. He did not, and could not,\nunderstand the meaning of words apart from their context. Every word and\naction of his was the manifestation of an activity unknown to him, which\nwas his life. But his life, as he regarded it, had no meaning as a separate\nthing. It had meaning only as part of a whole of which he was always\nconscious. His words and actions flowed from him as evenly, inevitably,\nand spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower.

Whether it were difficult or easy, possible or impossible, she did\nnot ask and did not want to know: it was her duty, not only to herself, to be\nnear her brother who was perhaps dying, but to do everything possible to\ntake his son to him, and so she prepared to set off. That she had not heard\nfrom Prince Andrew himself, Princess Mary attributed to his being too\nweak to write or to his considering the long journey too hard and too\ndangerous for her and his son.\nIn a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages were the\nhuge family coach in which she had traveled to Vorónezh, a semiopen trap,\nand a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle Bourienne, little\nNicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, Tíkhon, and a young\nfootman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her.\nThe usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and the\nroundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through Lípetsk,\nRyazán, Vladímir, and Shúya was very long and, as post horses were not\neverywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near Ryazán where the French\nwere said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.\nDuring this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, and\nPrincess Mary’s servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of\nspirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and no\ndifficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity and energy, which infected\nher fellow travelers, they approached Yaroslávl by the end of the second\nweek.\nThe last days of her stay in Vorónezh had been the happiest of her life.\nHer love for Rostóv no longer tormented or agitated her. It filled her whole"}, {"page": 1352, "text": "soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she no longer struggled\nagainst it. Latterly she had become convinced that she loved and was\nbeloved, though she never said this definitely to herself in words. She had\nbecome convinced of it at her last interview with Nicholas, when he had\ncome to tell her that her brother was with the Rostóvs. Not by a single word\nhad Nicholas alluded to the fact that Prince Andrew’s relations with Natásha\nmight, if he recovered, be renewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that\nhe knew and thought of this.\nYet in spite of that, his relation to her—considerate, delicate, and loving\n—not only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to Princess Mary\nthat he was even glad that the family connection between them allowed him\nto express his friendship more freely. She knew that she loved for the first\nand only time in her life and felt that she was beloved, and was happy in\nregard to it.\nBut this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent her\nfeeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary, that spiritual\ntranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her to give full play\nto her feeling for her brother. That feeling was so strong at the moment of\nleaving Vorónezh that those who saw her off, as they looked at her\ncareworn, despairing face, felt sure she would fall ill on the journey. But the\nvery difficulties and preoccupations of the journey, which she took so\nactively in hand, saved her for a while from her grief and gave her strength.\nAs always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of the\njourney itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached Yaroslávl the\nthought of what might await her there—not after many days, but that very\nevening—again presented itself to her and her agitation increased to its\nutmost limit.\nThe courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the\nRostóvs were staying in Yaroslávl, and in what condition Prince Andrew\nwas, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled\nby the terrible pallor of the princess’ face that looked out at him from the\nwindow.\n“I have found out everything, your excellency: the Rostóvs are staying at\nthe merchant Brónnikov’s house, in the Square not far from here, right\nabove the Vólga,” said the courier."}, {"page": 1353, "text": "Princess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding\nwhy he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was her\nbrother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.\n“How is the prince?” she asked.\n“His excellency is staying in the same house with them.”\n“Then he is alive,” thought Princess Mary, and asked in a low voice:\n“How is he?”\n“The servants say he is still the same.”\nWhat “still the same” might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with an\nunnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting in front\nof her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her head and did not\nraise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking and swaying, came to\na stop. The carriage steps clattered as they were let down.\nThe carriage door was opened. On the left there was water—a great river\n—and on the right a porch. There were people at the entrance: servants, and\na rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as it seemed to Princess\nMary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This was Sónya.) Princess Mary ran\nup the steps. “This way, this way!” said the girl, with the same artificial\nsmile, and the princess found herself in the hall facing an elderly woman of\nOriental type, who came rapidly to meet her with a look of emotion. This\nwas the countess. She embraced Princess Mary and kissed her.\n“Mon enfant!” she muttered, “je vous aime et vous connais depuis\nlongtemps.” *\n* “My child! I love you and have known you a long time.”\nDespite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the countess\nand that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly knowing how she\ndid it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in French in the same tone\nas those that had been addressed to her, and asked: “How is he?”\n“The doctor says that he is not in danger,” said the countess, but as she\nspoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed a\ncontradiction of her words.\n“Where is he? Can I see him—can I?” asked the princess.\n“One moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his son?” said the\ncountess, turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with Dessalles."}, {"page": 1354, "text": "“There will be room for everybody, this is a big house. Oh, what a lovely\nboy!”\nThe countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where Sónya\nwas talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed the boy, and\nthe old count came in and welcomed the princess. He had changed very\nmuch since Princess Mary had last seen him. Then he had been a brisk,\ncheerful, self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful, bewildered person.\nWhile talking to Princess Mary he continually looked round as if asking\neveryone whether he was doing the right thing. After the destruction of\nMoscow and of his property, thrown out of his accustomed groove he\nseemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to feel that there\nwas no longer a place for him in life.\nIn spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible, and her\nvexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they\nshould be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew, the\nprincess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the necessity of\nsubmitting, for a time, to this new order of things which she had entered.\nShe knew it to be necessary, and though it was hard for her she was not\nvexed with these people.\n“This is my niece,” said the count, introducing Sónya—“You don’t know\nher, Princess?”\nPrincess Mary turned to Sónya and, trying to stifle the hostile feeling that\narose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she felt oppressed by the\nfact that the mood of everyone around her was so far from what was in her\nown heart.\n“Where is he?” she asked again, addressing them all.\n“He is downstairs. Natásha is with him,” answered Sónya, flushing. “We\nhave sent to ask. I think you must be tired, Princess.”\nTears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary’s eyes. She turned\naway and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him, when light,\nimpetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door.

It was plain that at\nthat moment there was in Natásha’s heart no thought of herself or of her\nown relations with Prince Andrew.\nPrincess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at the first\nglance at Natásha’s face, and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful pleasure.\n“Come, come to him, Mary,” said Natásha, leading her into the other\nroom.\nPrincess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to Natásha. She\nfelt that from her she would be able to understand and learn everything.\n“How...” she began her question but stopped short.\nShe felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words. Natásha’s\nface and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and profoundly.\nNatásha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say\nall she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes\nwhich penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was impossible not to\ntell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly, Natásha’s lips twitched,\nugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and covering her face with her\nhands she burst into sobs.\nPrincess Mary understood.\nBut she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:\n“But how is his wound? What is his general condition?”\n“You, you... will see,” was all Natásha could say.\nThey sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off\ncrying and were able to go to him with calm faces."}, {"page": 1356, "text": "“How has his whole illness gone?

That danger had also passed.\nWhen they reached Yaroslávl the wound had begun to fester (Natásha knew\nall about such things as festering) and the doctor had said that the festering\nmight take a normal course. Then fever set in, but the doctor had said the\nfever was not very serious.\n“But two days ago this suddenly happened,” said Natásha, struggling\nwith her sobs. “I don’t know why, but you will see what he is like.”\n“Is he weaker?

Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now tried to\nremain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at him without\ntears.\nThe princess understood what Natásha had meant by the words: “two\ndays ago this suddenly happened.” She understood those words to mean\nthat he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were\nsigns of approaching death. As she stepped to the door she already saw in\nimagination Andrew’s face as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle,\nmild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore\naffected her very strongly. She was sure he would speak soft, tender words\nto her such as her father had uttered before his death, and that she would not\nbe able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his presence. Yet sooner or\nlater it had to be, and she went in. The sobs rose higher and higher in her\nthroat as she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her\nshortsighted eyes tried to make out his features, and then she saw his face\nand met his gaze.\nHe was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded by\npillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white hand he held\na handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he\nhad grown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them as they\nentered.\nOn seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary’s pace suddenly\nslackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased.

How did you manage to get here?” said he in a\nvoice as calm and aloof as his look.\nHad he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such\nhorror into Princess Mary’s heart as the tone of his voice.\n“And have you brought little Nicholas?” he asked in the same slow, quiet\nmanner and with an obvious effort to remember.\n“How are you now?” said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she\nwas saying.\n“That, my dear, you must ask the doctor,” he replied, and again making\nan evident effort to be affectionate, he said with his lips only (his words\nclearly did not correspond to his thoughts):\n“Merci, chère amie, d’être venue.” *\n* “Thank you for coming, my dear.”\nPrincess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just\nperceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She now\nunderstood what had happened to him two days before.

Evidently only with an effort did he understand anything living; but\nit was obvious that he failed to understand, not because he lacked the power\nto do so but because he understood something else—something the living\ndid not and could not understand—and which wholly occupied his mind.\n“There, you see how strangely fate has brought us together,” said he,\nbreaking the silence and pointing to Natásha. “She looks after me all the\ntime.”\nPrincess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a\nthing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say that,\nbefore her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to live he\ncould not have said those words in that offensively cold tone.

And\nthe more imbued he became with that principle of love, the more he\nrenounced life and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier\nwhich—in the absence of such love—stands between life and death.

And joyful and\nagitating thoughts began to occupy his mind. Recalling the moment at the\nambulance station when he had seen Kurágin, he could not now regain the\nfeeling he then had, but was tormented by the question whether Kurágin\nwas alive. And he dared not inquire.\nHis illness pursued its normal physical course, but what Natásha referred\nto when she said: “This suddenly happened,” had occurred two days before\nPrincess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual struggle between life and\ndeath, in which death gained the victory. It was the unexpected realization\nof the fact that he still valued life as presented to him in the form of his love\nfor Natásha, and a last, though ultimately vanquished, attack of terror\nbefore the unknown.\nIt was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish, and his\nthoughts were preternaturally clear. Sónya was sitting by the table. He\nbegan to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him.\n“Ah, she has come!” thought he.\nAnd so it was: in Sónya’s place sat Natásha who had just come in\nnoiselessly.\nSince she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced this\nphysical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in an armchair\nplaced sideways, screening the light of the candle from him, and was\nknitting a stocking. She had learned to knit stockings since Prince Andrew\nhad casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old nurses\nwho knit stockings, and that there is something soothing in the knitting of\nstockings. The needles clicked lightly in her slender, rapidly moving hands,\nand he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of her drooping face. She\nmoved, and the ball rolled off her knees. She started, glanced round at him,\nand screening the candle with her hand stooped carefully with a supple and\nexact movement, picked up the ball, and regained her former position.\nHe looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep\nbreath after stooping, but refrained from doing so and breathed cautiously.\nAt the Tróitsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and he had told her\nthat if he lived he would always thank God for his wound which had"}, {"page": 1364, "text": "brought them together again, but after that they never spoke of the future.\n“Can it or can it not be?” he now thought as he looked at her and listened\nto the light click of the steel needles. “Can fate have brought me to her so\nstrangely only for me to die?... Is it possible that the truth of life has been\nrevealed to me only to show me that I have spent my life in falsity? I love\nher more than anything in the world! But what am I to do if I love her?” he\nthought, and he involuntarily groaned, from a habit acquired during his\nsufferings.\nOn hearing that sound Natásha put down the stocking, leaned nearer to\nhim, and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped lightly up to him and\nbent over him.\n“You are not asleep?”\n“No, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you come in. No one\nelse gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do... that light. I want to\nweep for joy.”\nNatásha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous joy.\n“Natásha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world.”\n“And I!”—She turned away for an instant. “Why too much?” she asked.\n“Why too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel in your soul,\nyour whole soul—shall I live? What do you think?”\n“I am sure of it, sure!” Natásha almost shouted, taking hold of both his\nhands with a passionate movement.\nHe remained silent awhile.\n“How good it would be!” and taking her hand he kissed it.\nNatásha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this would\nnot do and that he had to be quiet.\n“But you have not slept,” she said, repressing her joy. “Try to sleep...\nplease!”\nHe pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle and\nsat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked at him,\nand her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on her stocking\nand resolved not to turn round till it was finished.\nSoon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep long and\nsuddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration."}, {"page": 1365, "text": "As he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now always\noccupied his mind—about life and death, and chiefly about death. He felt\nhimself nearer to it.\n“Love? What is love?” he thought.\n“Love hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I understand, I\nunderstand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only\nbecause I love. Everything is united by it alone. Love is God, and to die\nmeans that I, a particle of love, shall return to the general and eternal\nsource.” These thoughts seemed to him comforting. But they were only\nthoughts. Something was lacking in them, they were not clear, they were\ntoo one-sidedly personal and brain-spun. And there was the former agitation\nand obscurity. He fell asleep.\nHe dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, but that he\nwas quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, and insignificant\npeople appeared before him. He talked to them and discussed something\ntrivial. They were preparing to go away somewhere. Prince Andrew dimly\nrealized that all this was trivial and that he had more important cares, but he\ncontinued to speak, surprising them by empty witticisms. Gradually,\nunnoticed, all these persons began to disappear and a single question, that\nof the closed door, superseded all else. He rose and went to the door to bolt\nand lock it. Everything depended on whether he was, or was not, in time to\nlock it. He went, and tried to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he\nknew he would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained\nall his powers. He was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was the\nfear of death. It stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily\ncreeping toward the door, that dreadful something on the other side was\nalready pressing against it and forcing its way in. Something not human—\ndeath—was breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized\nthe door, making a final effort to hold it back—to lock it was no longer\npossible—but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from\nbehind by that terror, opened and closed again.\nOnce again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain\nand both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and it was death,\nand Prince Andrew died.\nBut at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep,\nand at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke."}, {"page": 1366, "text": "“Yes, it was death! I died—and woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!”\nAnd all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then\nconcealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision. He felt as if\npowers till then confined within him had been liberated, and that strange\nlightness did not again leave him.\nWhen, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan, Natásha\nwent up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer and looked\nat her strangely, not understanding.\nThat was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary’s\narrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting fever assumed\na malignant character, but what the doctor said did not interest Natásha, she\nsaw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing.\nFrom that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew together\nwith his awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration of life it did\nnot seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the\nduration of a dream.\nThere was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow\nawakening.\nHis last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both\nPrincess Mary and Natásha, who did not leave him, felt this. They did not\nweep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that they\nwere not attending on him (he was no longer there, he had left them) but on\nwhat reminded them most closely of him—his body. Both felt this so\nstrongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect them and\nthey did not feel it necessary to foment their grief. Neither in his presence\nnor out of it did they weep, nor did they ever talk to one another about him.\nThey felt that they could not express in words what they understood.\nThey both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper and deeper,\naway from them, and they both knew that this had to be so and that it was\nright.\nHe confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take leave of\nhim. When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the boy’s and\nturned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess Mary and Natásha\nunderstood that) but simply because he thought it was all that was required\nof him, but when they told him to bless the boy, he did what was demanded\nand looked round as if asking whether there was anything else he should do."}, {"page": 1367, "text": "When the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was leaving,\noccurred, Princess Mary and Natásha were present.\n“Is it over?” said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes\nlain motionless, growing cold before them.

They ascribe the\nglory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to\nwhom the honor is due. Even foreign historians, including the French,\nacknowledge the genius of the Russian commanders when they speak of\nthat flank march. But it is hard to understand why military writers, and\nfollowing them others, consider this flank march to be the profound\nconception of some one man who saved Russia and destroyed Napoleon. In\nthe first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius of\nthis movement lay, for not much mental effort was needed to see that the\nbest position for an army when it is not being attacked is where there are\nmost provisions; and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the\nbest position for an army after its retreat from Moscow in 1812 was on the\nKalúga road. So it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the\nhistorians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound one. And\nit is even more difficult to understand just why they think that this\nmaneuver was calculated to save Russia and destroy the French; for this\nflank march, had it been preceded, accompanied, or followed by other\ncircumstances, might have proved ruinous to the Russians and salutary for\nthe French. If the position of the Russian army really began to improve\nfrom the time of that march, it does not at all follow that the march was the\ncause of it.\nThat flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the\nRussian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its destruction.\nWhat would have happened had Moscow not burned down? If Murat had\nnot lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had not remained inactive? If the\nRussian army at Krásnaya Pakhrá had given battle as Bennigsen and\nBarclay advised?

What would have\nhappened if on approaching Tarútino, Napoleon had attacked the Russians\nwith but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at\nSmolénsk? What would have happened had the French moved on\nPetersburg?... In any of these eventualities the flank march that brought\nsalvation might have proved disastrous.\nThe third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying\nhistory deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be attributed\nto any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and that in reality, like the"}, {"page": 1372, "text": "retreat from Filí, it did not suggest itself to anyone in its entirety, but\nresulted—moment by moment, step by step, event by event—from an\nendless number of most diverse circumstances and was only seen in its\nentirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the past.\nAt the council at Filí the prevailing thought in the minds of the Russian\ncommanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a direct retreat\nby the Nízhni road. In proof of this there is the fact that the majority of the\ncouncil voted for such a retreat, and above all there is the well-known\nconversation after the council, between the commander in chief and\nLanskóy, who was in charge of the commissariat department. Lanskóy\ninformed the commander in chief that the army supplies were for the most\npart stored along the Oká in the Túla and Ryazán provinces, and that if they\nretreated on Nízhni the army would be separated from its supplies by the\nbroad river Oká, which cannot be crossed early in winter. This was the first\nindication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously seemed\nthe most natural course—a direct retreat on Nízhni-Nóvgorod. The army\nturned more to the south, along the Ryazán road and nearer to its supplies.\nSubsequently the inactivity of the French (who even lost sight of the\nRussian army), concern for the safety of the arsenal at Túla, and especially\nthe advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn still\nfurther south to the Túla road. Having crossed over, by a forced march, to\nthe Túla road beyond the Pakhrá, the Russian commanders intended to\nremain at Podólsk and had no thought of the Tarútino position; but\ninnumerable circumstances and the reappearance of French troops who had\nfor a time lost touch with the Russians, and projects of giving battle, and\nabove all the abundance of provisions in Kalúga province, obliged our army\nto turn still more to the south and to cross from the Túla to the Kalúga road\nand go to Tarútino, which was between the roads along which those\nsupplies lay.

Only when the army had got there, as the\nresult of innumerable and varying forces, did people begin to assure\nthemselves that they had desired this movement and long ago foreseen its\nresult."}, {"page": 1373, "text": "CHAPTER II\nThe famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the advance\nof the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been continually\nretreating straight back from the invaders, deviated from that direct course\nand, not finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn toward the district\nwhere supplies were abundant.\nIf instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the\nRussian army, we picture that army without any leaders, it could not have\ndone anything but make a return movement toward Moscow, describing an\narc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where the\ncountry was richest.\nThat movement from the Nízhni to the Ryazán, Túla, and Kalúga roads\nwas so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that direction, and\ndemands were sent from Petersburg for Kutúzov to take his army that way.\nAt Tarútino Kutúzov received what was almost a reprimand from the\nEmperor for having moved his army along the Ryazán road, and the\nEmperor’s letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied\nnear Kalúga.\nHaving rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the\nwhole campaign and by the battle of Borodinó, the Russian army—when\nthe strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was received\n—assumed the position natural to it.\nKutúzov’s merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as it is\ncalled, but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what had\nhappened. He alone then understood the meaning of the French army’s\ninactivity, he alone continued to assert that the battle of Borodinó had been\na victory, he alone—who as commander in chief might have been expected\nto be eager to attack—employed his whole strength to restrain the Russian\narmy from useless engagements."}, {"page": 1374, "text": "The beast wounded at Borodinó was lying where the fleeing hunter had\nleft him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and merely\nlying low, the hunter did not know.

These signs were: Lauriston’s mission; the\nabundance of provisions at Tarútino; the reports coming in from all sides of\nthe inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of recruits to our\nregiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian soldiers had enjoyed,\nand the impatience to do what they had been assembled for, which usually\nshows itself in an army that has been resting; curiosity as to what the"}, {"page": 1375, "text": "French army, so long lost sight of, was doing; the boldness with which our\noutposts now scouted close up to the French stationed at Tarútino; the news\nof easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the French,\nthe envy aroused by this; the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every\nRussian as long as the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim\nconsciousness in every soldier’s mind that the relative strength of the\narmies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side. There was\na substantial change in the relative strength, and an advance had become\ninevitable.

Before the news of the abandonment of\nMoscow had been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of the whole\ncampaign had been drawn up and sent to Kutúzov for his guidance. Though\nthis plan had been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow was still in our\nhands, it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action.\nKutúzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always\ndifficult to execute. So fresh instructions were sent for the solution of\ndifficulties that might be encountered, as well as fresh people who were to\nwatch Kutúzov’s actions and report upon them.\nBesides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now reorganized.\nThe posts left vacant by Bagratión, who had been killed, and by Barclay,\nwho had gone away in dudgeon, had to be filled. Very serious consideration\nwas given to the question whether it would be better to put A in B’s place\nand B in D’s, or on the contrary to put D in A’s place, and so on—as if\nanything more than A’s or B’s satisfaction depended on this.\nAs a result of the hostility between Kutúzov and Bennigsen, his Chief of\nStaff, the presence of confidential representatives of the Emperor, and these\ntransfers, a more than usually complicated play of parties was going on\namong the staff of the army. A was undermining B, D was undermining C,\nand so on in all possible combinations and permutations. In all these\nplottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct of the war, which\nall these men believed they were directing; but this affair of the war went on\nindependently of them, as it had to go: that is, never in the way people\ndevised, but flowing always from the essential attitude of the masses.

(wrote the Emperor on the second of\nOctober in a letter that reached Kutúzov after the battle at Tarútino) Since\nSeptember 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy. Your last reports\nwere written on the twentieth, and during all this time not only has no\naction been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient capital,\nbut according to your last report you have even retreated farther. Sérpukhov\nis already occupied by an enemy detachment and Túla with its famous\narsenal, so indispensable to the army, is in danger. From General\nWintzingerode’s reports, I see that an enemy corps of ten thousand men is\nmoving on the Petersburg road. Another corps of several thousand men is\nmoving on Dmítrov. A third has advanced along the Vladímir road, and a\nfourth, rather considerable detachment is stationed between Rúza and\nMozháysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as the twenty-fifth. In\nview of all this information, when the enemy has scattered his forces in\nlarge detachments, and with Napoleon and his Guards in Moscow, is it\npossible that the enemy’s forces confronting you are so considerable as not\nto allow of your taking the offensive? On the contrary, he is probably\npursuing you with detachments, or at most with an army corps much\nweaker than the army entrusted to you. It would seem that, availing yourself\nof these circumstances, you might advantageously attack a weaker one and\nannihilate him, or at least oblige him to retreat, retaining in our hands an\nimportant part of the provinces now occupied by the enemy, and thereby\naverting danger from Túla and other towns in the interior. You will be\nresponsible if the enemy is able to direct a force of any size against\nPetersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been possible to retain\nmany troops; for with the army entrusted to you, and acting with resolution\nand energy, you have ample means to avert this fresh calamity. Remember\nthat you have still to answer to our offended country for the loss of\nMoscow. You have experienced my readiness to reward you. That readiness\nwill not weaken in me, but I and Russia have a right to expect from you all\nthe zeal, firmness, and success which your intellect, military talent, and the\ncourage of the troops you command justify us in expecting.\nBut by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation of the\nforces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was dispatched, Kutúzov\nhad found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he commanded\nfrom attacking and a battle had taken place."}, {"page": 1378, "text": "On the second of October a Cossack, Shapoválov, who was out scouting,\nkilled one hare and wounded another.

The Cossack laughingly told his\ncomrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the French. A cornet,\nhearing the story, informed his commander.\nThe Cossack was sent for and questioned.

He sat in the calèche, dozing\nand waking up by turns, and listening for any sound of firing on the right as\nan indication that the action had begun. But all was still quiet.

This was a Polish\nsergeant of Poniatowski’s corps, who explained in Polish that he had come\nover because he had been slighted in the service: that he ought long ago to\nhave been made an officer, that he was braver than any of them, and so he\nhad left them and wished to pay them out. He said that Murat was spending\nthe night less than a mile from where they were, and that if they would let\nhim have a convoy of a hundred men he would capture him alive.

Our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open declivity\nto his right. He looked in that direction, but though the columns would have\nbeen visible quite far off, they were not to be seen. It seemed to the count\nthat things were beginning to stir in the French camp, and his keen-sighted\nadjutant confirmed this.\n“Oh, it is really too late,” said Count Orlóv, looking at the camp.\nAs often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our\neyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the sergeant\nwas an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian attack would\nbe ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which he would lead away\nheaven only knew where. How could one capture a commander in chief\nfrom among such a mass of troops!\n“I am sure that rascal was lying,” said the count.\n“They can still be called back,” said one of his suite, who like Count\nOrlóv felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemy’s camp.\n“Eh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them go on or not?”\n“Will you have them fetched back?”\n“Fetch them back, fetch them back!” said Count Orlóv with sudden\ndetermination, looking at his watch. “It will be too late.

With a minimum of effort and insignificant losses, despite the\ngreatest confusion, the most important results of the whole campaign were\nattained: the transition from retreat to advance, an exposure of the weakness\nof the French, and the administration of that shock which Napoleon’s army\nhad only awaited to begin its flight."}, {"page": 1391, "text": "CHAPTER VIII\nNapoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; there\ncan be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of\nthe French. The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital. Moscow,\nabounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and incalculable wealth, is in\nNapoleon’s hands. The Russian army, only half the strength of the French,\ndoes not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month. Napoleon’s\nposition is most brilliant. He can either fall on the Russian army with\ndouble its strength and destroy it; negotiate an advantageous peace, or in\ncase of a refusal make a menacing move on Petersburg, or even, in the case\nof a reverse, return to Smolénsk or Vílna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no\nspecial genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position the\nFrench held at that time. For that, only very simple and easy steps were\nnecessary: not to allow the troops to loot, to prepare winter clothing—of\nwhich there was sufficient in Moscow for the whole army—and\nmethodically to collect the provisions, of which (according to the French\nhistorians) there were enough in Moscow to supply the whole army for six\nmonths. Yet Napoleon, that greatest of all geniuses, who the historians\ndeclare had control of the army, took none of these steps.\nHe not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used his\npower to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to him.\nOf all that Napoleon might have done: wintering in Moscow, advancing on\nPetersburg or on Nízhni-Nóvgorod, or retiring by a more northerly or more\nsoutherly route (say by the road Kutúzov afterwards took), nothing more\nstupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he actually did. He remained\nin Moscow till October, letting the troops plunder the city; then, hesitating\nwhether to leave a garrison behind him, he quitted Moscow, approached\nKutúzov without joining battle, turned to the right and reached Málo-\nYaroslávets, again without attempting to break through and take the road\nKutúzov took, but retiring instead to Mozháysk along the devastated"}, {"page": 1392, "text": "Smolénsk road. Nothing more stupid than that could have been devised, or\nmore disastrous for the army, as the sequel showed. Had Napoleon’s aim\nbeen to destroy his army, the most skillful strategist could hardly have\ndevised any series of actions that would so completely have accomplished\nthat purpose, independently of anything the Russian army might do.\nNapoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he destroyed his\narmy because he wished to, or because he was very stupid, would be as\nunjust as to say that he had brought his troops to Moscow because he\nwished to and because he was very clever and a genius.\nIn both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the\npersonal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws that guided\nthe event.\nThe historians quite falsely represent Napoleon’s faculties as having\nweakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did not justify his\nactions. He employed all his ability and strength to do the best he could for\nhimself and his army, as he had done previously and as he did subsequently\nin 1813. His activity at that time was no less astounding than it was in\nEgypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in Prussia. We do not know for certain in\nhow far his genius was genuine in Egypt—where forty centuries looked\ndown upon his grandeur—for his great exploits there are all told us by\nFrenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius in Austria or Prussia,\nfor we have to draw our information from French or German sources, and\nthe incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without fighting and of\nfortresses without a siege must incline Germans to recognize his genius as\nthe only explanation of the war carried on in Germany. But we, thank God,\nhave no need to recognize his genius in order to hide our shame. We have\npaid for the right to look at the matter plainly and simply, and we will not\nabandon that right.\nHis activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as\nelsewhere. Order after order and plan after plan were issued by him from\nthe time he entered Moscow till the time he left it. The absence of citizens\nand of a deputation, and even the burning of Moscow, did not disconcert\nhim. He did not lose sight either of the welfare of his army or of the doings\nof the enemy, or of the welfare of the people of Russia, or of the direction\nof affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of\nthe anticipated peace."}, {"page": 1393, "text": "CHAPTER IX\nWith regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately on his entry into\nMoscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements of\nthe Russian army, sent army corps out along the different roads, and\ncharged Murat to find Kutúzov. Then he gave careful directions about the\nfortification of the Krémlin, and drew up a brilliant plan for a future\ncampaign over the whole map of Russia.\nWith regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain\nYákovlev, who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to\nget out of Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and his\nmagnanimity, and having written a letter to the Emperor Alexander in\nwhich he considered it his duty to inform his Friend and Brother that\nRostopchín had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he dispatched Yákovlev\nto Petersburg.\nHaving similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to Tutólmin,\nhe dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.\nWith regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders to\nfind and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel Rostopchín was\npunished by an order to burn down his houses.\nWith regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a\nconstitution.

The Emperor rode\nthrough the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and, despite his\npreoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the theaters that were\nestablished by his order.\nIn regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads, Napoleon\nalso did all in his power. He caused the words Maison de ma Mère to be\ninscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining tender filial\naffection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He visited the\nFoundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by him to kiss his\nwhite hands, graciously conversed with Tutólmin. Then, as Thiers\neloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged Russian\nmoney which he had prepared: “Raising the use of these means by an act\nworthy of himself and of the French army, he let relief be distributed to\nthose who had been burned out. But as food was too precious to be given to\nforeigners, who were for the most part enemies, Napoleon preferred to\nsupply them with money with which to purchase food from outside, and had\npaper rubles distributed to them.”\nWith reference to army discipline, orders were continually being issued\nto inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties and\nto suppress robbery."}, {"page": 1397, "text": "CHAPTER X\nBut strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plans—which were not\nat all worse than others issued in similar circumstances—did not affect the\nessence of the matter but, like the hands of a clock detached from the\nmechanism, swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without engaging\nthe cogwheels.\nWith reference to the military side—the plan of campaign—that work of\ngenius of which Thiers remarks that, “His genius never devised anything\nmore profound, more skillful, or more admirable,” and enters into a polemic\nwith M. Fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred not to the\nfourth but to the fifteenth of October—that plan never was or could be\nexecuted, for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the case. The\nfortifying of the Krémlin, for which la Mosquée (as Napoleon termed the\nchurch of Basil the Beatified) was to have been razed to the ground, proved\nquite useless. The mining of the Krémlin only helped toward fulfilling\nNapoleon’s wish that it should be blown up when he left Moscow—as a\nchild wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to be beaten. The pursuit\nof the Russian army, about which Napoleon was so concerned, produced an\nunheard-of result. The French generals lost touch with the Russian army of\nsixty thousand men, and according to Thiers it was only eventually found,\nlike a lost pin, by the skill—and apparently the genius—of Murat.\nWith reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon’s arguments as to his\nmagnanimity and justice, both to Tutólmin and to Yákovlev (whose chief\nconcern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless;\nAlexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their\nembassage.\nWith regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed\nincendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down."}, {"page": 1398, "text": "With regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a municipality\ndid not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain people who formed\npart of that municipality and under pretext of preserving order looted\nMoscow or saved their own property from being looted.\nWith regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had so easily been\nsettled by Napoleon’s visit to a mosque, no results were achieved. Two or\nthree priests who were found in Moscow did try to carry out Napoleon’s\nwish, but one of them was slapped in the face by a French soldier while\nconducting service, and a French official reported of another that: “The\npriest whom I found and invited to say Mass cleaned and locked up the\nchurch. That night the doors were again broken open, the padlocks\nsmashed, the books mutilated, and other disorders perpetrated.”\nWith reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious workmen\nand to peasants evoked no response. There were no industrious workmen,\nand the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town\nwith the proclamation and killed them.\nAs to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops,\nthese did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in the Krémlin\nand in Posnyákov’s house were closed again at once because the actors and\nactresses were robbed.\nEven philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as well as\nthe false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The French,\ncollecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the paper money\nvalueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate, but\neven silver lost its value in relation to gold.\nBut the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given\nby the authorities at that time was Napoleon’s attempt to stop the looting\nand re-establish discipline.\nThis is what the army authorities were reporting:\n“Looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order is not\nyet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a lawful\nmanner.

There is a band of thieves in our district\nwho ought to be arrested by a strong force—October 11.”\n“The Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to\nstop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning to\nthe Krémlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed\nmore violently than ever yesterday evening, last night, and today. The\nEmperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his\nperson, who should set an example of discipline, carry disobedience to such\na point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army supplies.\nOthers have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and\nofficers, and have abused and beaten them.”\n“The Grand Marshal of the palace,” wrote the governor, “complains\nbitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to commit\nnuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows of the\nEmperor.”\nThat army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the\nprovender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated and\nperished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But it did not go\naway.\nIt began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the\ncapture of transport trains on the Smolénsk road, and by the battle of\nTarútino. The news of that battle of Tarútino, unexpectedly received by\nNapoleon at a review, evoked in him a desire to punish the Russians (Thiers\nsays), and he issued the order for departure which the whole army was\ndemanding.\nFleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had\nstolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personal trésor, but on seeing\nthe baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (Thiers says) horror-\nstruck. And yet with his experience of war he did not order all the\nsuperfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with those of a certain\nmarshal when approaching Moscow. He gazed at the calèches and carriages"}, {"page": 1400, "text": "in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing, as\nthose vehicles could be used to carry provisions, the sick, and the wounded.\nThe plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which\nfeels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. To study the skillful\ntactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from the time it entered Moscow\ntill it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps and shudders of a\nmortally wounded animal. Very often a wounded animal, hearing a rustle,\nrushes straight at the hunter’s gun, runs forward and back again, and hastens\nits own end. Napoleon, under pressure from his whole army, did the same\nthing. The rustle of the battle of Tarútino frightened the beast, and it rushed\nforward onto the hunter’s gun, reached him, turned back, and finally—like\nany wild beast—ran back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous\npath, where the old scent was familiar.\nDuring the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have been\nthe leader of all these movements—as the figurehead of a ship may seem to\na savage to guide the vessel—acted like a child who, holding a couple of\nstrings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it."}, {"page": 1401, "text": "CHAPTER XI\nEarly in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of the shed,\nand on returning stopped by the door to play with a little blue-gray dog,\nwith a long body and short bandy legs, that jumped about him. This little\ndog lived in their shed, sleeping beside Karatáev at night; it sometimes\nmade excursions into the town but always returned again. Probably it had\nnever had an owner, and it still belonged to nobody and had no name. The\nFrench called it Azor; the soldier who told stories called it Femgálka;\nKaratáev and others called it Gray, or sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a\nmaster, a name, or even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to\ntrouble the blue-gray dog in the least. Its furry tail stood up firm and round\nas a plume, its bandy legs served it so well that it would often gracefully lift\na hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three legs, as if disdaining to\nuse all four. Everything pleased it. Now it would roll on its back, yelping\nwith delight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance, and\nnow frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw.\nPierre’s attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only remnant of\nhis former clothing), a pair of soldier’s trousers which by Karatáev’s advice\nhe tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and a peasant coat and cap.\nPhysically he had changed much during this time. He no longer seemed\nstout, though he still had the appearance of solidity and strength hereditary\nin his family. A beard and mustache covered the lower part of his face, and\na tangle of hair, infested with lice, curled round his head like a cap. The\nlook of his eyes was resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before.\nThe former slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now\nreplaced by an energetic readiness for action and resistance. His feet were\nbare.\nPierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen\nwere passing that morning, then into the distance across the river, then at\nthe dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him, and then at"}, {"page": 1402, "text": "his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various positions, moving his\ndirty thick big toes. Every time he looked at his bare feet a smile of\nanimated self-satisfaction flitted across his face. The sight of them\nreminded him of all he had experienced and learned during these weeks and\nthis recollection was pleasant to him.\nFor some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in\nthe mornings—what is called an “old wives’ summer.”\nIn the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly\npleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in the air.\nOn everything—far and near—lay the magic crystal glitter seen only at\nthat time of autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance, with\nthe village, the church, and the large white house. The bare trees, the sand,\nthe bricks and roofs of the houses, the green church spire, and the corners of\nthe white house in the distance, all stood out in the transparent air in most\ndelicate outline and with unnatural clearness. Near by could be seen the\nfamiliar ruins of a half-burned mansion occupied by the French, with lilac\nbushes still showing dark green beside the fence. And even that ruined and\nbefouled house—which in dull weather was repulsively ugly—seemed\nquietly beautiful now, in the clear, motionless brilliance.\nA French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a skullcap on\nhis head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from behind a corner of the\nshed and approached Pierre with a friendly wink.\n“What sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!” (Their name for Pierre.) “Eh? Just like\nspring!”\nAnd the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his pipe,\nthough whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it.\n“To be on the march in such weather...” he began.\nPierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the corporal told\nhim that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an order\nabout the prisoners that day. Sokolóv, one of the soldiers in the shed with\nPierre, was dying, and Pierre told the corporal that something should be\ndone about him. The corporal replied that Pierre need not worry about that\nas they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and arrangements\nwould be made for the sick, and that in general everything that could\nhappen had been foreseen by the authorities."}, {"page": 1403, "text": "“Besides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the captain, you\nknow. He is a man who never forgets anything. Speak to the captain when\nhe makes his round, he will do anything for you.”\n(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with Pierre\nand showed him all sorts of favors.)\n“‘You see, St. Thomas,’ he said to me the other day. ‘Monsieur Kiril is a\nman of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who has\nhad misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows what’s what.... If he wants\nanything and asks me, he won’t get a refusal. When one has studied, you\nsee, one likes education and well-bred people.’ It is for your sake I mention\nit, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not been for you that affair would\nhave ended ill.”\nAnd after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The affair he\nhad alluded to had happened a few days before—a fight between the\nprisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had succeeded in\npacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had heard Pierre\ntalking to the corporal immediately asked what the Frenchman had said.\nWhile Pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving\nMoscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier came up to the door of the\nshed. Rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way of\ngreeting, he asked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to whom he had\ngiven a shirt to sew was in that shed.\nA week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to them,\nwhich they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and shirts\nfor them.\n“Ready, ready, dear fellow!” said Karatáev, coming out with a neatly\nfolded shirt.\nKaratáev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work,\nwas wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot. His hair was\nbound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree bast, and his round\nface seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.\n“A promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here it is,\nready,” said Platón, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn.\nThe Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his\nhesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had a long,"}, {"page": 1404, "text": "greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin bare body, but no\nshirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on would laugh at him,\nand thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly. None of the prisoners said a\nword.\n“See, it fits well!” Platón kept repeating, pulling the shirt straight.\nThe Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without\nraising his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.\n“You see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I had no proper tools;\nand, as they say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse,” said Platón with one\nof his round smiles, obviously pleased with his work.\n“It’s good, quite good, thank you,” said the Frenchman, in French, “but\nthere must be some linen left over.”\n“It will fit better still when it sets to your body,” said Karatáev, still\nadmiring his handiwork. “You’ll be nice and comfortable....”\n“Thanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?” said the Frenchman\nagain and smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note and gave it to\nKaratáev. “But give me the pieces that are over.”\nPierre saw that Platón did not want to understand what the Frenchman\nwas saying, and he looked on without interfering. Karatáev thanked the\nFrenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work. The\nFrenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and\nasked Pierre to translate what he said.\n“What does he want the bits for?” said Karatáev. “They’d make fine leg\nbands for us. Well, never mind.”\nAnd Karatáev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression, took a\nsmall bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the Frenchman\nwithout looking at him. “Oh dear!” muttered Karatáev and went away. The\nFrenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment, then looked\ninquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierre’s look had told him something,\nsuddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:\n“Platoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!” And handing back the odd\nbits he turned and went out.\n“There, look at that,” said Karatáev, swaying his head. “People said they\nwere not Christians, but they too have souls. It’s what the old folk used to"}, {"page": 1405, "text": "say: ‘A sweating hand’s an open hand, a dry hand’s close.’ He’s naked, but\nyet he’s given it back.”\nKaratáev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the pieces.\n“But they’ll make grand leg bands, dear friend,” he said, and went back\ninto the shed."}, {"page": 1406, "text": "CHAPTER XII\nFour weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and though\nthe French had offered to move him from the men’s to the officers’ shed, he\nhad stayed in the shed where he was first put.\nIn burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the extreme\nlimits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to his physical strength and\nhealth, of which he had till then been unconscious, and thanks especially to\nthe fact that the privations came so gradually that it was impossible to say\nwhen they began, he endured his position not only lightly but joyfully. And\njust at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had\nformerly striven in vain to reach. He had long sought in different ways that\ntranquillity of mind, that inner harmony which had so impressed him in the\nsoldiers at the battle of Borodinó. He had sought it in philanthropy, in\nFreemasonry, in the dissipations of town life, in wine, in heroic feats of\nself-sacrifice, and in romantic love for Natásha; he had sought it by\nreasoning—and all these quests and experiments had failed him. And now\nwithout thinking about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only\nthrough the horror of death, through privation, and through what he\nrecognized in Karatáev.\nThose dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it\nwere forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating\nthoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important. It did not now\noccur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or politics, or Napoleon. It was\nplain to him that all these things were no business of his, and that he was\nnot called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so.\n“Russia and summer weather are not bound together,” he thought, repeating\nwords of Karatáev’s which he found strangely consoling. His intention of\nkilling Napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast\nof the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous. His\nanger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now"}, {"page": 1407, "text": "seemed not merely trivial but even amusing. What concern was it of his that\nsomewhere or other that woman was leading the life she preferred?

Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness\ncould only be negative, but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony\nas though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is\nimplanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied. But Pierre\nbelieved it without any mental reservation. The absence of suffering, the\nsatisfaction of one’s needs and consequent freedom in the choice of one’s\noccupation, that is, of one’s way of life, now seemed to Pierre to be\nindubitably man’s highest happiness. Here and now for the first time he\nfully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat, drinking\nwhen he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of warmth\nwhen he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk and to\nhear a human voice. The satisfaction of one’s needs—good food,\ncleanliness, and freedom—now that he was deprived of all this, seemed to\nPierre to constitute perfect happiness; and the choice of occupation, that is,\nof his way of life—now that that was so restricted—seemed to him such an\neasy matter that he forgot that a superfluity of the comforts of life destroys\nall joy in satisfying one’s needs, while great freedom in the choice of\noccupation—such freedom as his wealth, his education, and his social\nposition had given him in his own life—is just what makes the choice of\noccupation insolubly difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of\nhaving an occupation.\nAll Pierre’s daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free.\nYet subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought and spoke with\nenthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those irrecoverable, strong, joyful\nsensations, and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner freedom\nwhich he experienced only during those weeks.\nWhen on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn, and\nsaw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still dark at\nfirst, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills, and the wooded\nbanks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance, when he felt"}, {"page": 1408, "text": "the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying from\nMoscow across the field, and when afterwards light gleamed from the east\nand the sun’s rim appeared solemnly from behind a cloud, and the cupolas\nand crosses, the hoarfrost, the distance and the river, all began to sparkle in\nthe glad light—Pierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he had\nnever before known. And this not only stayed with him during the whole of\nhis imprisonment, but even grew in strength as the hardships of his position\nincreased.\nThat feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still further\nstrengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners formed of him\nsoon after his arrival at the shed. With his knowledge of languages, the\nrespect shown him by the French, his simplicity, his readiness to give\nanything asked of him (he received the allowance of three rubles a week\nmade to officers); with his strength, which he showed to the soldiers by\npressing nails into the walls of the hut; his gentleness to his companions,\nand his capacity for sitting still and thinking without doing anything (which\nseemed to them incomprehensible), he appeared to them a rather mysterious\nand superior being. The very qualities that had been a hindrance, if not\nactually harmful, to him in the world he had lived in—his strength, his\ndisdain for the comforts of life, his absent-mindedness and simplicity—here\namong these people gave him almost the status of a hero. And Pierre felt\nthat their opinion placed responsibilities upon him."}, {"page": 1409, "text": "CHAPTER XIII\nThe French evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh\nof October: kitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts loaded, and troops\nand baggage trains started.\nAt seven in the morning a French convoy in marching trim, wearing\nshakos and carrying muskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood in\nfront of the sheds, and animated French talk mingled with curses sounded\nall along the lines.\nIn the shed everyone was ready, dressed, belted, shod, and only awaited\nthe order to start. The sick soldier, Sokolóv, pale and thin with dark\nshadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed. His\neyes, prominent from the emaciation of his face, gazed inquiringly at his\ncomrades who were paying no attention to him, and he moaned regularly\nand quietly. It was evidently not so much his sufferings that caused him to\nmoan (he had dysentery) as his fear and grief at being left alone.\nPierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes Karatáev had\nmade for him from some leather a French soldier had torn off a tea chest\nand brought to have his boots mended with, went up to the sick man and\nsquatted down beside him.\n“You know, Sokolóv, they are not all going away! They have a hospital\nhere. You may be better off than we others,” said Pierre.\n“O Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!” moaned the man in a\nlouder voice.\n“I’ll go and ask them again directly,” said Pierre, rising and going to the\ndoor of the shed.\nJust as Pierre reached the door, the corporal who had offered him a pipe\nthe day before came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal and soldiers\nwere in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal straps, and\nthese changed their familiar faces."}, {"page": 1410, "text": "The corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door. The prisoners\nhad to be counted before being let out.\n“Corporal, what will they do with the sick man?...” Pierre began.\nBut even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he\nknew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that moment.\nMoreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was suddenly\nheard from both sides. The corporal frowned at Pierre’s words and, uttering\nsome meaningless oaths, slammed the door. The shed became semidark,\nand the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned the sick man’s\ngroans.\n“There it is!... It again!...” said Pierre to himself, and an involuntary\nshudder ran down his spine. In the corporal’s changed face, in the sound of\nhis voice, in the stirring and deafening noise of the drums, he recognized\nthat mysterious, callous force which compelled people against their will to\nkill their fellow men—that force the effect of which he had witnessed\nduring the executions. To fear or to try to escape that force, to address\nentreaties or exhortations to those who served as its tools, was useless.\nPierre knew this now. One had to wait and endure. He did not again go to\nthe sick man, nor turn to look at him, but stood frowning by the door of the\nhut.\nWhen that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one\nanother like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed his way\nforward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had assured\nhim was ready to do anything for him. The captain was also in marching kit,\nand on his cold face appeared that same it which Pierre had recognized in\nthe corporal’s words and in the roll of the drums.\n“Pass on, pass on!” the captain reiterated, frowning sternly, and looking\nat the prisoners who thronged past him.\nPierre went up to him, though he knew his attempt would be vain.\n“What now?” the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing\nPierre.\nPierre told him about the sick man.\n“He’ll manage to walk, devil take him!” said the captain. “Pass on, pass\non!” he continued without looking at Pierre.\n“But he is dying,” Pierre again began."}, {"page": 1411, "text": "“Be so good...” shouted the captain, frowning angrily.\n“Dram-da-da-dam, dam-dam...” rattled the drums, and Pierre understood\nthat this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it was\nnow useless to say any more.\nThe officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march\nin front. There were about thirty officers, with Pierre among them, and\nabout three hundred men.\nThe officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all strangers to\nPierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at him and at his shoes\nmistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him walked a fat major with a\nsallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing a Kazán dressing gown tied\nround with a towel, and who evidently enjoyed the respect of his fellow\nprisoners. He kept one hand, in which he clasped his tobacco pouch, inside\nthe bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with\nthe other. Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and growled at\neverybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all\nhurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at\nsomething when there was nothing to be surprised at. Another, a thin little\nofficer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing where they were now being\ntaken and how far they would get that day. An official in felt boots and\nwearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at\nthe ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his observations as to what had\nbeen burned down and what this or that part of the city was that they could\nsee. A third officer, who by his accent was a Pole, disputed with the\ncommissariat officer, arguing that he was mistaken in his identification of\nthe different wards of Moscow.\n“What are you disputing about?” said the major angrily. “What does it\nmatter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it’s burned down,\nand there’s an end of it.... What are you pushing for? Isn’t the road wide\nenough?” said he, turning to a man behind him who was not pushing him at\nall.\n“Oh, oh, oh! What have they done?” the prisoners on one side and\nanother were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. “All beyond\nthe river, and Zúbova, and in the Krémlin.... Just look! There’s not half of it\nleft. Yes, I told you—the whole quarter beyond the river, and so it is.”"}, {"page": 1412, "text": "“Well, you know it’s burned, so what’s the use of talking?” said the\nmajor.\nAs they passed near a church in the Khamóvniki (one of the few\nunburned quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly\nstarted to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.\n“Ah, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And\nsmeared with something!”\nPierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these\nexclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the palings\nsurrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw better\nthan he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set upright against the\npalings with its face smeared with soot.\n“Go on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!...” the convoy\nguards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh virulence, drove\naway with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead\nman."}, {"page": 1413, "text": "CHAPTER XIV\nThrough the cross streets of the Khamóvniki quarter the prisoners\nmarched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons\nbelonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they came\namong a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with private\nvehicles.\nAt the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get across.\nFrom the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage trains\nbefore and behind them. To the right, where the Kalúga road turns near\nNeskúchny, endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into the\ndistance. These were troops of Beauharnais’ corps which had started before\nany of the others. Behind, along the riverside and across the Stone Bridge,\nwere Ney’s troops and transport.\nDavout’s troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing the\nCrimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kalúga road.\nBut the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnais’ train\nhad not yet got out of Moscow and reached the Kalúga road when the\nvanguard of Ney’s army was already emerging from the Great Ordýnka\nStreet.\nWhen they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few\nsteps forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles and\nmen crowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few hundred\npaces that separated the bridge from the Kalúga road, taking more than an\nhour to do so, and came out upon the square where the streets of the\nTransmoskvá ward and the Kalúga road converge, and the prisoners\njammed close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway. From\nall sides, like the roar of the sea, were heard the rattle of wheels, the tramp\nof feet, and incessant shouts of anger and abuse. Pierre stood pressed\nagainst the wall of a charred house, listening to that noise which mingled in\nhis imagination with the roll of the drums."}, {"page": 1414, "text": "To get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of the\nhalf-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.\n“What crowds! Just look at the crowds!... They’ve loaded goods even on\nthe cannon! Look there, those are furs!” they exclaimed. “Just see what the\nblackguards have looted.... There! See what that one has behind in the\ncart.... Why, those are settings taken from some icons, by heaven!... Oh, the\nrascals!... See how that fellow has loaded himself up, he can hardly walk!\nGood lord, they’ve even grabbed those chaises!... See that fellow there\nsitting on the trunks.... Heavens! They’re fighting.”\n“That’s right, hit him on the snout—on his snout! Like this, we shan’t get\naway before evening. Look, look there.... Why, that must be Napoleon’s\nown. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown! It’s like a\nportable house.... That fellow’s dropped his sack and doesn’t see it. Fighting\nagain... A woman with a baby, and not bad-looking either! Yes, I dare say,\nthat’s the way they’ll let you pass.... Just look, there’s no end to it. Russian\nwenches, by heaven, so they are! In carriages—see how comfortably\nthey’ve settled themselves!”\nAgain, as at the church in Khamóvniki, a wave of general curiosity bore\nall the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to his stature, saw\nover the heads of the others what so attracted their curiosity. In three\ncarriages involved among the munition carts, closely squeezed together, sat\nwomen with rouged faces, dressed in glaring colors, who were shouting\nsomething in shrill voices.\nFrom the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the\nmysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the\ncorpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the\nburned ruins of Moscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely made an\nimpression on him—as if his soul, making ready for a hard struggle, refused\nto receive impressions that might weaken it.\nThe women’s vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts, soldiers,\nwagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts, more\nsoldiers, and now and then women.\nPierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.\nAll these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible\npower. During the hour Pierre watched them they all came flowing from the\ndifferent streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly; they all"}, {"page": 1415, "text": "jostled one another, began to grow angry and to fight, white teeth gleamed,\nbrows frowned, ever the same words of abuse flew from side to side, and all\nthe faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression\nthat had struck Pierre that morning on the corporal’s face when the drums\nwere beating.\nIt was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort\ncollected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among the\nbaggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all sides, emerged onto the\nKalúga road.\nThey marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only when the\nsun began to set. The baggage carts drew up close together and the men\nbegan to prepare for their night’s rest. They all appeared angry and\ndissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could be\nheard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort ran into one of the\ncarts and knocked a hole in it with its pole. Several soldiers ran toward the\ncart from different sides: some beat the carriage horses on their heads,\nturning them aside, others fought among themselves, and Pierre saw that\none German was badly wounded on the head by a sword.\nIt seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid fields in the\nchill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one and the same feeling of\nunpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on that had\nseized them at the start. Once at a standstill they all seemed to understand\nthat they did not yet know where they were going, and that much that was\npainful and difficult awaited them on this journey.\nDuring this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had\ndone at the start. It was here that the prisoners for the first time received\nhorseflesh for their meat ration.\nFrom the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed\nlike personal spite against each of the prisoners, in unexpected contrast to\ntheir former friendly relations.\nThis spite increased still more when, on calling over the roll of prisoners,\nit was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian soldier, who\nhad pretended to suffer from colic, had escaped. Pierre saw a Frenchman\nbeat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the road, and heard\nhis friend the captain reprimand and threaten to court-martial a\nnoncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the Russian. To the"}, {"page": 1416, "text": "noncommissioned officer’s excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not\nwalk, the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged\nbehind. Pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the\nexecutions, but which he had not felt during his imprisonment, now again\ncontrolled his existence. It was terrible, but he felt that in proportion to the\nefforts of that fatal force to crush him, there grew and strengthened in his\nsoul a power of life independent of it.\nHe ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his\ncomrades.\nNeither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in\nMoscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the French, or of the\norder to shoot them which had been announced to them. As if in reaction\nagainst the worsening of their position they were all particularly animated\nand gay. They spoke of personal reminiscences, of amusing scenes they had\nwitnessed during the campaign, and avoided all talk of their present\nsituation.\nThe sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and there in the\nsky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the\nrising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray haze. It\ngrew light. The evening was ending, but the night had not yet come. Pierre\ngot up and left his new companions, crossing between the campfires to the\nother side of the road where he had been told the common soldier prisoners\nwere stationed. He wanted to talk to them. On the road he was stopped by a\nFrench sentinel who ordered him back.\nPierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an\nunharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him and\ndropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the cart\nand remained motionless a long while sunk in thought. Suddenly he burst\nout into a fit of his broad, good-natured laughter, so loud that men from\nvarious sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and evidently\nsolitary laughter could mean.\n“Ha-ha-ha!” laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to himself: “The soldier\ndid not let me pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold me captive.\nWhat, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...” and he laughed\ntill tears started to his eyes."}, {"page": 1417, "text": "A man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at\nall by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went farther away from the\ninquisitive man, and looked around him.\nThe huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the\ncrackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the red\ncampfires were growing paler and dying down. High up in the light sky\nhung the full moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp, unseen before,\nwere now visible in the distance. And farther still, beyond those forests and\nfields, the bright, oscillating, limitless distance lured one to itself. Pierre\nglanced up at the sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway depths. “And all\nthat is me, all that is within me, and it is all I!” thought Pierre. “And they\ncaught all that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks!” He smiled,\nand went and lay down to sleep beside his companions."}, {"page": 1418, "text": "CHAPTER XV\nIn the early days of October another envoy came to Kutúzov with a letter\nfrom Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow, though\nNapoleon was already not far from Kutúzov on the old Kalúga road.\nKutúzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought by\nLauriston, saying that there could be no question of peace.\nSoon after that a report was received from Dórokhov’s guerrilla\ndetachment operating to the left of Tarútino that troops of Broussier’s\ndivision had been seen at Formínsk and that being separated from the rest of\nthe French army they might easily be destroyed. The soldiers and officers\nagain demanded action. Generals on the staff, excited by the memory of the\neasy victory at Tarútino, urged Kutúzov to carry out Dórokhov’s suggestion.\nKutúzov did not consider any offensive necessary. The result was a\ncompromise which was inevitable: a small detachment was sent to\nFormínsk to attack Broussier.\nBy a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most\ndifficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokhtúrov—that same modest\nlittle Dokhtúrov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of\nbattles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering crosses on batteries,\nand so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of as undecided and\nundiscerning—but whom we find commanding wherever the position was\nmost difficult all through the Russo-French wars from Austerlitz to the year\n1813. At Austerlitz he remained last at the Augezd dam, rallying the\nregiments, saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing and\nnot a single general was left in the rear guard. Ill with fever he went to\nSmolénsk with twenty thousand men to defend the town against Napoleon’s\nwhole army. In Smolénsk, at the Malákhov Gate, he had hardly dozed off in\na paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the\ntown—and Smolénsk held out all day long.

And the quiet little Dokhtúrov rode thither, and Borodinó became the\ngreatest glory of the Russian army. Many heroes have been described to us\nin verse and prose, but of Dokhtúrov scarcely a word has been said.\nIt was Dokhtúrov again whom they sent to Formínsk and from there to\nMálo-Yaroslávets, the place where the last battle with the French was\nfought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army began; and\nwe are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign, but\nof Dokhtúrov nothing or very little is said and that dubiously. And this\nsilence about Dokhtúrov is the clearest testimony to his merit.\nIt is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a\nmachine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance and is\ninterfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most important part.\nThe man who does not understand the construction of the machine cannot\nconceive that the small connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is one\nof the most essential parts of the machine, and not the shaving which\nmerely harms and hinders the working.\nOn the tenth of October when Dokhtúrov had gone halfway to Formínsk\nand stopped at the village of Aristóvo, preparing faithfully to execute the\norders he had received, the whole French army having, in its convulsive\nmovement, reached Murat’s position apparently in order to give battle—\nsuddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new Kalúga road\nand began to enter Formínsk, where only Broussier had been till then. At\nthat time Dokhtúrov had under his command, besides Dórokhov’s\ndetachment, the two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and Seslávin.\nOn the evening of October 11 Seslávin came to the Aristóvo headquarters\nwith a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner said that the troops\nthat had entered Formínsk that day were the vanguard of the whole army,\nthat Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four days\npreviously. That same evening a house serf who had come from Bórovsk\nsaid he had seen an immense army entering the town. Some Cossacks of\nDokhtúrov’s detachment reported having sighted the French Guards\nmarching along the road to Bórovsk.

So it was\ndecided to send a dispatch to the staff.\nFor this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhovítinov, was chosen, who was\nto explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering a written\nreport. Toward midnight Bolkhovítinov, having received the dispatch and\nverbal instructions, galloped off to the General Staff accompanied by a\nCossack with spare horses."}, {"page": 1421, "text": "CHAPTER XVI\nIt was a warm, dark, autumn night.

Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a\nsignboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he entered a\ndark passage.\n“The general on duty, quick!

This\nwas Konovnítsyn.\nWhen the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up,\nfirst blue and then red, Shcherbínin lit the tallow candle, from the\ncandlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were\nrunning away, and looked at the messenger. Bolkhovítinov was bespattered\nall over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve.\n“Who gave the report?” inquired Shcherbínin, taking the envelope.\n“The news is reliable,” said Bolkhovítinov. “Prisoners, Cossacks, and the\nscouts all say the same thing.”\n“There’s nothing to be done, we’ll have to wake him,” said Shcherbínin,\nrising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a\ngreatcoat. “Peter Petróvich!” said he.

On Konovnítsyn’s\nhandsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever, there still remained\nfor an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs, but\nthen he suddenly started and his face assumed its habitual calm and firm\nappearance.\n“Well, what is it? From whom?” he asked immediately but without hurry,\nblinking at the light.\nWhile listening to the officer’s report Konovnítsyn broke the seal and\nread the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in their\nwoolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his boots.

He did not consider or ask\nhimself whether the news was good or bad. That did not interest him.

There was within him a deep unexpressed\nconviction that all would be well, but that one must not trust to this and still\nless speak about it, but must only attend to one’s own work. And he did his\nwork, giving his whole strength to the task.\nPeter Petróvich Konovnítsyn, like Dokhtúrov, seems to have been\nincluded merely for propriety’s sake in the list of the so-called heroes of\n1812—the Barclays, Raévskis, Ermólovs, Plátovs, and Milorádoviches.\nLike Dokhtúrov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited\ncapacity and information, and like Dokhtúrov he never made plans of battle\nbut was always found where the situation was most difficult. Since his\nappointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open,\ngiving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up. In\nbattle he was always under fire, so that Kutúzov reproved him for it and\nfeared to send him to the front, and like Dokhtúrov he was one of those\nunnoticed cogwheels that, without clatter or noise, constitute the most\nessential part of the machine.\nComing out of the hut into the damp, dark night Konovnítsyn frowned—\npartly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant\nthought that occurred to him, of how all that nest of influential men on the\nstaff would be stirred up by this news, especially Bennigsen, who ever since\nTarútino had been at daggers drawn with Kutúzov; and how they would\nmake suggestions, quarrel, issue orders, and rescind them. And this\npremonition was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be\nhelped.\nAnd in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news,\nimmediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters,\nuntil Konovnítsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded him that they\nmust go to see his Highness."}, {"page": 1424, "text": "CHAPTER XVII\nKutúzov like all old people did not sleep much at night. He often fell\nasleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his bed without\nundressing, he generally remained awake thinking.\nSo he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred head on his\nplump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and peering into the\ndarkness.\nSince Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more\ninfluence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him, Kutúzov\nwas more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being\nobliged to take part in useless aggressive movements. The lesson of the\nTarútino battle and of the day before it, which Kutúzov remembered with\npain, must, he thought, have some effect on others too.\n“They must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive.\nPatience and time are my warriors, my champions,” thought Kutúzov. He\nknew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will fall of\nitself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled, the tree is harmed,\nand your teeth are set on edge. Like an experienced sportsman he knew that\nthe beast was wounded, and wounded as only the whole strength of Russia\ncould have wounded it, but whether it was mortally wounded or not was\nstill an undecided question. Now by the fact of Lauriston and Barthélemi\nhaving been sent, and by the reports of the guerrillas, Kutúzov was almost\nsure that the wound was mortal. But he needed further proofs and it was\nnecessary to wait.\n“They want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and we shall\nsee!

It seems to them\nthat when they have thought of two or three contingencies” (he remembered\nthe general plan sent him from Petersburg) “they have foreseen everything.\nBut the contingencies are endless.”\nThe undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at Borodinó\nwas mortal or not had hung over Kutúzov’s head for a whole month. On the\none hand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other Kutúzov felt\nassured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the\nRussians had put their whole strength must have been mortal. But in any\ncase proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for them and grew\nmore impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed during those\nsleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals for\ndoing. He imagined all sorts of possible contingencies, just like the younger\nmen, but with this difference, that he saw thousands of contingencies\ninstead of two or three and based nothing on them. The longer he thought\nthe more contingencies presented themselves. He imagined all sorts of\nmovements of the Napoleonic army as a whole or in sections—against\nPetersburg, or against him, or to outflank him. He thought too of the\npossibility (which he feared most of all) that Napoleon might fight him with\nhis own weapon and remain in Moscow awaiting him. Kutúzov even\nimagined that Napoleon’s army might turn back through Medýn and\nYukhnóv, but the one thing he could not foresee was what happened—the\ninsane, convulsive stampede of Napoleon’s army during its first eleven days\nafter leaving Moscow: a stampede which made possible what Kutúzov had\nnot yet even dared to think of—the complete extermination of the French.\nDórokhov’s report about Broussier’s division, the guerrillas’ reports of\ndistress in Napoleon’s army, rumors of preparations for leaving Moscow, all\nconfirmed the supposition that the French army was beaten and preparing\nfor flight. But these were only suppositions, which seemed important to the\nyounger men but not to Kutúzov. With his sixty years’ experience he knew\nwhat value to attach to rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything\nare to group all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he\nknew how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary.\nAnd the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it.

An external\nshock was needed to overcome that shame, and this shock came in due\ntime. It was what the French called “le hourra de l’Empereur.”\nThe day after the council at Málo-Yaroslávets Napoleon rode out early in\nthe morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and an\nescort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the previous\nand of the impending battle. Some Cossacks on the prowl for booty fell in\nwith the Emperor and very nearly captured him. If the Cossacks did not\ncapture Napoleon then, what saved him was the very thing that was\ndestroying the French army, the booty on which the Cossacks fell.

But that native land\nwas too far off, and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely\nnecessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself: “Today I shall get\nto a place twenty-five miles off where I shall rest and spend the night,” and\nduring the first day’s journey that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal\nand attracts all his hopes and desires. And the impulses felt by a single\nperson are always magnified in a crowd.\nFor the French retreating along the old Smolénsk road, the final goal—\ntheir native land—was too remote, and their immediate goal was Smolénsk,\ntoward which all their desires and hopes, enormously intensified in the\nmass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that much food and fresh\ntroops awaited them in Smolénsk, nor that they were told so (on the\ncontrary their superior officers, and Napoleon himself, knew that provisions\nwere scarce there), but because this alone could give them strength to move\non and endure their present privations. So both those who knew and those\nwho did not know deceived themselves, and pushed on to Smolénsk as to a\npromised land.\nComing out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising energy and\nunheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on. Besides the common\nimpulse which bound the whole crowd of French into one mass and\nsupplied them with a certain energy, there was another cause binding them\ntogether—their great numbers.

An army gains\na victory, and at once the rights of the conquering nation have increased to\nthe detriment of the defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and at once a\npeople loses its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its\narmy suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.\nSo according to history it has been found from the most ancient times,\nand so it is to our own day. All Napoleon’s wars serve to confirm this rule.\nIn proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army Austria loses its rights, and\nthe rights and the strength of France increase. The victories of the French at\nJena and Auerstädt destroy the independent existence of Prussia.\nBut then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow is\ntaken and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia that ceases to\nexist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and then Napoleonic\nFrance itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of history: to say that the"}, {"page": 1436, "text": "field of battle at Borodinó remained in the hands of the Russians, or that\nafter Moscow there were other battles that destroyed Napoleon’s army, is\nimpossible.\nAfter the French victory at Borodinó there was no general engagement\nnor any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist. What\ndoes this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of China, we\nmight say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the historians’\nusual expedient when anything does not fit their standards); if the matter\nconcerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took\npart, we might treat it as an exception; but this event occurred before our\nfathers’ eyes, and for them it was a question of the life or death of their\nfatherland, and it happened in the greatest of all known wars.\nThe period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodinó to the\nexpulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not\nproduce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest; it\nproved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the\nconquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else.\nThe French historians, describing the condition of the French army\nbefore it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army,\nexcept the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport—there was no forage for\nthe horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one could remedy, for the\npeasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the French have it.\nThe victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants\nKarp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their\ncarts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest any\nheroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such peasants, did\nnot bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered them, but burned it\ninstead.\nLet us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers\naccording to all the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has gone on for\nsome time; suddenly one of the combatants, feeling himself wounded and\nunderstanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his life, throws down\nhis rapier, and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish\nit. Then let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the\nbest and simplest means to attain his end was at the same time influenced\nby traditions of chivalry and, desiring to conceal the facts of the case,"}, {"page": 1437, "text": "insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to all the\nrules of art. One can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result\nfrom such an account of the duel.\nThe fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was\nthe French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up\nthe cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter\naccording to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described the\nevent.\nAfter the burning of Smolénsk a war began which did not follow any\nprevious traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the retreats\nafter battles, the blow dealt at Borodinó and the renewed retreat, the\nburning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of transports, and\nthe guerrilla war were all departures from the rules.\nNapoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing\nattitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent’s rapier saw a cudgel raised\nabove his head, he did not cease to complain to Kutúzov and to the Emperor\nAlexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the rules—as if\nthere were any rules for killing people. In spite of the complaints of the\nFrench as to the nonobservance of the rules, in spite of the fact that to some\nhighly placed Russians it seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel\nand they wanted to assume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the\nrules, and to make an adroit thrust en prime, and so on—the cudgel of the\npeople’s war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength, and\nwithout consulting anyone’s tastes or rules and regardless of anything else,\nit rose and fell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the\nFrench till the whole invasion had perished.\nAnd it is well for a people who do not—as the French did in 1813—\nsalute according to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their rapier\ngracefully and politely, hand it to their magnanimous conqueror, but at the\nmoment of trial, without asking what rules others have adopted in similar\ncases, simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and\nstrike with it till the feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to\na feeling of contempt and compassion."}, {"page": 1438, "text": "CHAPTER II\nOne of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so-called\nlaws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed together in\na mass.

This was done by the guerrillas in\nSpain, by the mountain tribes in the Caucasus, and by the Russians in 1812.\nPeople have called this kind of war “guerrilla warfare” and assume that\nby so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a war does not fit\nin under any rule and is directly opposed to a well-known rule of tactics\nwhich is accepted as infallible. That rule says that an attacker should\nconcentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his opponent at the\nmoment of conflict.\nGuerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly infringes that\nrule.\nThis contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes the\nstrength of an army to be identical with its numbers. Military science says\nthat the more troops the greater the strength. Les gros bataillons ont\ntoujours raison. *\n* Large battalions are always victorious.\nFor military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics\nby reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are equal or unequal to\neach other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal.\nMomentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.\nIn military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass and\nsome unknown x."}, {"page": 1439, "text": "Military science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact that\nthe size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small\ndetachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the existence of this\nunknown factor and tries to discover it—now in a geometric formation,\nnow in the equipment employed, now, and most usually, in the genius of the\ncommanders. But the assignment of these various meanings to the factor\ndoes not yield results which accord with the historic facts.\nYet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to gratify the\n“heroes”) of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by\ncommanders, in order to find this unknown quantity.\nThat unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the greater\nor lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men composing an\narmy, quite independently of whether they are, or are not, fighting under the\ncommand of a genius, in two—or three-line formation, with cudgels or with\nrifles that repeat thirty times a minute. Men who want to fight will always\nput themselves in the most advantageous conditions for fighting.\nThe spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives the\nresulting force. To define and express the significance of this unknown\nfactor—the spirit of an army—is a problem for science.\nThis problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for the\nunknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes apparent—\nsuch as the commands of the general, the equipment employed, and so on—\nmistaking these for the real significance of the factor, and if we recognize\nthis unknown quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to\nfight and to face danger.

But this rule which leaves out of account the spirit\nof the army continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking\ncontrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of the troops\noccurs, as in all national wars.\nThe French, retreating in 1812—though according to tactics they should\nhave separated into detachments to defend themselves—congregated into a\nmass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass held the\narmy together. The Russians, on the contrary, ought according to tactics to\nhave attacked in mass, but in fact they split up into small units, because\ntheir spirit had so risen that separate individuals, without orders, dealt blows\nat the French without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose\nthemselves to hardships and dangers."}, {"page": 1441, "text": "CHAPTER III\nThe so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into\nSmolénsk.\nBefore partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the\ngovernment, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had\nbeen destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off as\ninstinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death. Denís Davýdov, with\nhis Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the value of this terrible\ncudgel which regardless of the rules of military science destroyed the\nFrench, and to him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward\nregularizing this method of warfare.\nOn August 24 Davýdov’s first partisan detachment was formed and then\nothers were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more\nnumerous these detachments became.\nThe irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the\nfallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree—the\nFrench army—and sometimes shook that tree itself. By October, when the\nFrench were fleeing toward Smolénsk, there were hundreds of such\ncompanies, of various sizes and characters. There were some that adopted\nall the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs, and the comforts of\nlife. Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry.

By the end of October this\nkind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had become clear to all what\ncould be ventured against the French and what could not. Now only the\ncommanders of detachments with staffs, and moving according to rules at a\ndistance from the French, still regarded many things as impossible. The\nsmall bands that had started their activities long before and had already\nobserved the French closely considered things possible which the\ncommanders of the big detachments did not dare to contemplate. The\nCossacks and peasants who crept in among the French now considered\neverything possible.\nOn October 22, Denísov (who was one of the irregulars) was with his\ngroup at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morning he and\nhis party had been on the move. All day long he had been watching from\nthe forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of cavalry\nbaggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the army, which—\nas was learned from spies and prisoners—was moving under a strong escort\nto Smolénsk. Besides Denísov and Dólokhov (who also led a small party\nand moved in Denísov’s vicinity), the commanders of some large divisions\nwith staffs also knew of this convoy and, as Denísov expressed it, were\nsharpening their teeth for it. Two of the commanders of large parties—one a\nPole and the other a German—sent invitations to Denísov almost\nsimultaneously, requesting him to join up with their divisions to attack the\nconvoy.\n“No, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself,” said Denísov on\nreading these documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite his\nheartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general, he had to\nforgo that pleasure because he was already under the command of the\nPolish general. To the Polish general he replied to the same effect,\ninforming him that he was already under the command of the German.\nHaving arranged matters thus, Denísov and Dólokhov intended, without\nreporting matters to the higher command, to attack and seize that convoy\nwith their own small forces. On October 22 it was moving from the village\nof Mikúlino to that of Shámshevo. To the left of the road between Mikúlino\nand Shámshevo there were large forests, extending in some places up to the\nroad itself though in others a mile or more back from it.

That morning, Cossacks of Denísov’s party had seized and\ncarried off into the forest two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles, which\nhad stuck in the mud not far from Mikúlino where the forest ran close to the\nroad. Since then, and until evening, the party had watched the movements\nof the French without attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach\nShámshevo quietly without alarming them and then, after joining Dólokhov\nwho was to come that evening to a consultation at a watchman’s hut in the\nforest less than a mile from Shámshevo, to surprise the French at dawn,\nfalling like an avalanche on their heads from two sides, and rout and\ncapture them all at one blow.\nIn their rear, more than a mile from Mikúlino where the forest came right\nup to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of\nFrench should show themselves.\nBeyond Shámshevo, Dólokhov was to observe the road in the same way,\nto find out at what distance there were other French troops. They reckoned\nthat the convoy had fifteen hundred men. Denísov had two hundred, and\nDólokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of numbers did not\ndeter Denísov. All that he now wanted to know was what troops these were\nand to learn that he had to capture a “tongue”—that is, a man from the\nenemy column. That morning’s attack on the wagons had been made so\nhastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; only a little\ndrummer boy had been taken alive, and as he was a straggler he could tell\nthem nothing definite about the troops in that column.\nDenísov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of\nputting the whole column on the alert, so he sent Tíkhon Shcherbáty, a\npeasant of his party, to Shámshevo to try and seize at least one of the\nFrench quartermasters who had been sent on in advance."}, {"page": 1444, "text": "CHAPTER IV\nIt was a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and the horizon were both the\ncolor of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and then suddenly\nheavy slanting rain came down.\nDenísov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down\nwas riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides. Like his horse,\nwhich turned its head and laid its ears back, he shrank from the driving rain\nand gazed anxiously before him. His thin face with its short, thick black\nbeard looked angry.\nBeside Denísov rode an esaul, * Denísov’s fellow worker, also in felt\ncloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.\n* A captain of Cossacks.\nEsaul Lováyski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow, pale-\nfaced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm self-satisfaction in\nhis face and bearing. Though it was impossible to say in what the\npeculiarity of the horse and rider lay, yet at first glance at the esaul and\nDenísov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was a man\nmounted on a horse, while looking at the esaul one saw that he was as\ncomfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not a man who\nhad mounted a horse, but a man who was one with his horse, a being\nconsequently possessed of twofold strength.\nA little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and\nwearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.\nA little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirghíz mount with an enormous\ntail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a blue French\novercoat.\nBeside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform and\nblue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on to the"}, {"page": 1445, "text": "hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with\nsurprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that morning.\nBehind them along the narrow, sodden, cut up forest road came hussars\nin threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in French\ngreatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The horses, being\ndrenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay. Their necks,\nwith their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely thin. Steam rose\nfrom them. Clothes, saddles, reins, were all wet, slippery, and sodden, like\nthe ground and the fallen leaves that strewed the road. The men sat huddled\nup trying not to stir, so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies\nand not admit the fresh cold water that was leaking in under their seats,\ntheir knees, and at the back of their necks. In the midst of the outspread line\nof Cossacks two wagons, drawn by French horses and by saddled Cossack\nhorses that had been hitched on in front, rumbled over the tree stumps and\nbranches and splashed through the water that lay in the ruts.\nDenísov’s horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped\nhis rider’s knee against a tree.\n“Oh, the devil!” exclaimed Denísov angrily, and showing his teeth he\nstruck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and his\ncomrades with mud.\nDenísov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger\n(none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more because he\nstill had no news from Dólokhov and the man sent to capture a “tongue”\nhad not returned.\n“There’ll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today.\nIt’s too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it off till another day\none of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey from under our\nnoses,” thought Denísov, continually peering forward, hoping to see a\nmessenger from Dólokhov.\nOn coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the\nright, Denísov stopped.\n“There’s someone coming,” said he.\nThe esaul looked in the direction Denísov indicated.\n“There are two, an officer and a Cossack.

In front, at a weary gallop\nand using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and drenched, whose\ntrousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him, standing in the\nstirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young lad with a broad rosy\nface and keen merry eyes, galloped up to Denísov and handed him a sodden\nenvelope.\n“From the general,” said the officer. “Please excuse its not being quite\ndry.”\nDenísov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.\n“There, they kept telling us: ‘It’s dangerous, it’s dangerous,’” said the\nofficer, addressing the esaul while Denísov was reading the dispatch. “But\nKomaróv and I”—he pointed to the Cossack—“were prepared. We have\neach of us two pistols.... But what’s this?” he asked, noticing the French\ndrummer boy. “A prisoner? You’ve already been in action? May I speak to\nhim?”\n“Wostóv! Pétya!” exclaimed Denísov, having run through the dispatch.\n“Why didn’t you say who you were?” and turning with a smile he held out\nhis hand to the lad.\nThe officer was Pétya Rostóv.\nAll the way Pétya had been preparing himself to behave with Denísov as\nbefitted a grown-up man and an officer—without hinting at their previous\nacquaintance. But as soon as Denísov smiled at him Pétya brightened up,\nblushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner he had been rehearsing,\nand began telling him how he had already been in a battle near Vyázma and\nhow a certain hussar had distinguished himself there.\n“Well, I am glad to see you,” Denísov interrupted him, and his face again\nassumed its anxious expression.\n“Michael Feoklítych,” said he to the esaul, “this is again fwom that\nGerman, you know. He”—he indicated Pétya—“is serving under him.”\nAnd Denísov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a\nrepetition of the German general’s demand that he should join forces with\nhim for an attack on the transport."}, {"page": 1447, "text": "“If we don’t take it tomowwow, he’ll snatch it fwom under our noses,” he\nadded.\nWhile Denísov was talking to the esaul, Pétya—abashed by Denísov’s\ncold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his trousers—\nfurtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so that no one should\nnotice it, while maintaining as martial an air as possible.\n“Will there be any orders, your honor?” he asked Denísov, holding his\nhand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for which\nhe had prepared himself, “or shall I remain with your honor?”\n“Orders?” Denísov repeated thoughtfully. “But can you stay till\ntomowwow?”\n“Oh, please... May I stay with you?” cried Pétya.\n“But, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?” asked\nDenísov.\nPétya blushed.\n“He gave me no instructions. I think I could?” he returned, inquiringly.\n“Well, all wight,” said Denísov.\nAnd turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place\narranged near the watchman’s hut in the forest, and told the officer on the\nKirghíz horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant) to go and find out\nwhere Dólokhov was and whether he would come that evening. Denísov\nhimself intended going with the esaul and Pétya to the edge of the forest\nwhere it reached out to Shámshevo, to have a look at the part of the French\nbivouac they were to attack next day.\n“Well, old fellow,” said he to the peasant guide, “lead us to Shámshevo.”\nDenísov, Pétya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and the\nhussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the edge of\nthe forest."}, {"page": 1448, "text": "CHAPTER V\nThe rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from the\ntrees. Denísov, the esaul, and Pétya rode silently, following the peasant in\nthe knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned toes and moving\nnoiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves, silently led them\nto the edge of the forest.\nHe ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to\nwhere the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree that\nhad not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them\nwith his hand.\nDenísov and Pétya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant was\nstanding they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest, on a\ndownward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a steep\nravine, was a small village and a landowner’s house with a broken roof. In\nthe village, in the house, in the garden, by the well, by the pond, over all the\nrising ground, and all along the road uphill from the bridge leading to the\nvillage, not more than five hundred yards away, crowds of men could be\nseen through the shimmering mist. Their un-Russian shouting at their\nhorses which were straining uphill with the carts, and their calls to one\nanother, could be clearly heard.\n“Bwing the prisoner here,” said Denísov in a low voice, not taking his\neyes off the French.\nA Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to Denísov.\nPointing to the French troops, Denísov asked him what these and those of\nthem were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and lifting his\neyebrows, looked at Denísov in affright, but in spite of an evident desire to\nsay all he knew gave confused answers, merely assenting to everything\nDenísov asked him. Denísov turned away from him frowning and addressed\nthe esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him."}, {"page": 1449, "text": "Pétya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy, now at\nDenísov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village and along\nthe road, trying not to miss anything of importance.\n“Whether Dólokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?” said Denísov\nwith a merry sparkle in his eyes.\n“It is a very suitable spot,” said the esaul.\n“We’ll send the infantwy down by the swamps,” Denísov continued.\n“They’ll cweep up to the garden; you’ll wide up fwom there with the\nCossacks”—he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village—“and I\nwith my hussars fwom here. And at the signal shot...”\n“The hollow is impassable—there’s a swamp there,” said the esaul. “The\nhorses would sink. We must ride round more to the left....”\nWhile they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded from\nthe low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, then another,\nand the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French voices shouting\ntogether came up from the slope. For a moment Denísov and the esaul drew\nback. They were so near that they thought they were the cause of the firing\nand shouting. But the firing and shouting did not relate to them. Down\nbelow, a man wearing something red was running through the marsh. The\nFrench were evidently firing and shouting at him.\n“Why, that’s our Tíkhon,” said the esaul.\n“So it is! It is!”\n“The wascal!” said Denísov.\n“He’ll get away!” said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.\nThe man whom they called Tíkhon, having run to the stream, plunged in\nso that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared for an instant,\nscrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet, and ran on. The French\nwho had been pursuing him stopped.\n“Smart, that!” said the esaul.\n“What a beast!” said Denísov with his former look of vexation. “What\nhas he been doing all this time?”\n“Who is he?” asked Pétya.\n“He’s our plastún. I sent him to capture a ‘tongue.’”"}, {"page": 1450, "text": "“Oh, yes,” said Pétya, nodding at the first words Denísov uttered as if he\nunderstood it all, though he really did not understand anything of it.\nTíkhon Shcherbáty was one of the most indispensable men in their band.\nHe was a peasant from Pokróvsk, near the river Gzhat. When Denísov had\ncome to Pokróvsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual\nsummoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the French,\nthe elder, as though shielding himself, had replied, as all village elders did,\nthat he had neither seen nor heard anything of them. But when Denísov\nexplained that his purpose was to kill the French, and asked if no French\nhad strayed that way, the elder replied that some “more-orderers” had really\nbeen at their village, but that Tíkhon Shcherbáty was the only man who\ndealt with such matters. Denísov had Tíkhon called and, having praised him\nfor his activity, said a few words in the elder’s presence about loyalty to the\nTsar and the country and the hatred of the French that all sons of the\nfatherland should cherish.\n“We don’t do the French any harm,” said Tíkhon, evidently frightened by\nDenísov’s words. “We only fooled about with the lads for fun, you know!\nWe killed a score or so of ‘more-orderers,’ but we did no harm else....”\nNext day when Denísov had left Pokróvsk, having quite forgotten about\nthis peasant, it was reported to him that Tíkhon had attached himself to their\nparty and asked to be allowed to remain with it. Denísov gave orders to let\nhim do so.\nTíkhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching water,\nflaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking and aptitude for\npartisan warfare. At night he would go out for booty and always brought\nback French clothing and weapons, and when told to would bring in French\ncaptives also. Denísov then relieved him from drudgery and began taking\nhim with him when he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled among\nthe Cossacks.\nTíkhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging\nbehind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried\nrather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf uses its\nteeth, with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones.\nTíkhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at arm’s length, or\nholding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons. In\nDenísov’s party he held a peculiar and exceptional position. When anything"}, {"page": 1451, "text": "particularly difficult or nasty had to be done—to push a cart out of the mud\nwith one’s shoulders, pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail, skin it, slink in\namong the French, or walk more than thirty miles in a day—everybody\npointed laughingly at Tíkhon.\n“It won’t hurt that devil—he’s as strong as a horse!” they said of him.\nOnce a Frenchman Tíkhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and\nshot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound (which Tíkhon treated\nonly with internal and external applications of vodka) was the subject of the\nliveliest jokes by the whole detachment—jokes in which Tíkhon readily\njoined.\n“Hallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?” the Cossacks would\nbanter him. And Tíkhon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended to\nbe angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only effect\nof this incident on Tíkhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought\nin prisoners.\nHe was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found more\nopportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more Frenchmen, and\nconsequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars and\nwillingly accepted that role. Now he had been sent by Denísov overnight to\nShámshevo to capture a “tongue.” But whether because he had not been\ncontent to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept through the\nnight, he had crept by day into some bushes right among the French and, as\nDenísov had witnessed from above, had been detected by them."}, {"page": 1452, "text": "CHAPTER VI\nAfter talking for some time with the esaul about next day’s attack, which\nnow, seeing how near they were to the French, he seemed to have definitely\ndecided on, Denísov turned his horse and rode back.\n“Now, my lad, we’ll go and get dwy,” he said to Pétya.\nAs they approached the watchhouse Denísov stopped, peering into the\nforest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging arms,\nwearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a Kazán hat, was approaching with\nlong, light steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax stuck in\nhis girdle. When he espied Denísov he hastily threw something into the\nbushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim, and approached his\ncommander. It was Tíkhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow\nlittle eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He lifted his head high and\ngazed at Denísov as if repressing a laugh.\n“Well, where did you disappear to?” inquired Denísov.\n“Where did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen,” answered Tíkhon\nboldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass voice.\n“Why did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well, why\nhaven’t you taken one?”\n“Oh, I took one all right,” said Tíkhon.\n“Where is he?”\n“You see, I took him first thing at dawn,” Tíkhon continued, spreading\nout his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes. “I took him into the\nforest. Then I see he’s no good and think I’ll go and fetch a likelier one.”\n“You see?... What a wogue—it’s just as I thought,” said Denísov to the\nesaul. “Why didn’t you bwing that one?”\n“What was the good of bringing him?” Tíkhon interrupted hastily and\nangrily—“that one wouldn’t have done for you.

He starts yelling, and suddenly there were four of\nthem. They rushed at me with their little swords. So I went for them with\nmy ax, this way: ‘What are you up to?’ says I. ‘Christ be with you!’”\nshouted Tíkhon, waving his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his\nchest.\n“Yes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the\npuddles!” said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.\nPétya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained from\nlaughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from Tíkhon’s face to the esaul’s and\nDenísov’s, unable to make out what it all meant.\n“Don’t play the fool!” said Denísov, coughing angrily. “Why didn’t you\nbwing the first one?”\nTíkhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other,\nthen suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin,\ndisclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called\nShcherbáty—the gap-toothed). Denísov smiled, and Pétya burst into a peal\nof merry laughter in which Tíkhon himself joined.\n“Oh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,” said Tíkhon. “The clothes\non him—poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your honor!\nWhy, he says: ‘I’m a general’s son myself, I won’t go!’ he says.”\n“You are a bwute!” said Denísov. “I wanted to question...”\n“But I questioned him,” said Tíkhon. “He said he didn’t know much.\n‘There are a lot of us,’ he says, ‘but all poor stuff—only soldiers in name,’\nhe says. ‘Shout loud at them,’ he says, ‘and you’ll take them all,’” Tíkhon\nconcluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into Denísov’s eyes.\n“I’ll give you a hundwed sharp lashes—that’ll teach you to play the\nfool!” said Denísov severely.\n“But why are you angry?” remonstrated Tíkhon, “just as if I’d never seen\nyour Frenchmen!

He looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt a\npang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted only a moment. He felt it\nnecessary to hold his head higher, to brace himself, and to question the\nesaul with an air of importance about tomorrow’s undertaking, that he\nmight not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself.\nThe officer who had been sent to inquire met Denísov on the way with\nthe news that Dólokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.\nDenísov at once cheered up and, calling Pétya to him, said: “Well, tell me\nabout yourself.”"}, {"page": 1455, "text": "CHAPTER VII\nPétya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow, joined\nhis regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a\nlarge guerrilla detachment. From the time he received his commission, and\nespecially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the battle of\nVyázma, Pétya had been in a constant state of blissful excitement at being\ngrown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any chance to do\nsomething really heroic. He was highly delighted with what he saw and\nexperienced in the army, but at the same time it always seemed to him that\nthe really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not\nhappen to be. And he was always in a hurry to get where he was not.\nWhen on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish to send\nsomebody to Denísov’s detachment, Pétya begged so piteously to be sent\nthat the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he recalled\nPétya’s mad action at the battle of Vyázma, where instead of riding by the\nroad to the place to which he had been sent, he had galloped to the\nadvanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired his\npistol. So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action\nwhatever of Denísov’s. That was why Pétya had blushed and grown\nconfused when Denísov asked him whether he could stay. Before they had\nridden to the outskirts of the forest Pétya had considered he must carry out\nhis instructions strictly and return at once. But when he saw the French and\nsaw Tíkhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack that night,\nhe decided, with the rapidity with which young people change their views,\nthat the general, whom he had greatly respected till then, was a rubbishy\nGerman, that Denísov was a hero, the esaul a hero, and Tíkhon a hero too,\nand that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a moment of\ndifficulty.\nIt was already growing dusk when Denísov, Pétya, and the esaul rode up\nto the watchhouse.

Pétya\ntook off his wet clothes, gave them to be dried, and at once began helping\nthe officers to fix up the dinner table.\nIn ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it. On the table\nwere vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.\nSitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton with\nhis hands, down which the grease trickled, Pétya was in an ecstatic childish\nstate of love for all men, and consequently of confidence that others loved\nhim in the same way.\n“So then what do you think, Vasíli Dmítrich?” said he to Denísov. “It’s\nall right my staying a day with you?” And not waiting for a reply he\nanswered his own question: “You see I was told to find out—well, I am\nfinding out.... Only do let me into the very... into the chief... I don’t want a\nreward....

Oh, you want a\nknife?” he said, turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of\nmutton.\nAnd he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.\n“Please keep it. I have several like it,” said Pétya, blushing. “Heavens! I\nwas quite forgetting!” he suddenly cried. “I have some raisins, fine ones;\nyou know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler and he has such capital\nthings. I bought ten pounds. I am used to something sweet. Would you like\nsome?...” and Pétya ran out into the passage to his Cossack and brought\nback some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins. “Have some,\ngentlemen, have some!”\n“You want a coffeepot, don’t you?” he asked the esaul. “I bought a\ncapital one from our sutler!

Haven’t they hurt his feelings?” he thought.\nBut having caught himself saying too much about the flints, he was now\nafraid to speak out.\n“I might ask,” he thought, “but they’ll say: ‘He’s a boy himself and so he\npities the boy.’ I’ll show them tomorrow whether I’m a boy.

He was awfully hungry!”\nThe sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the\ndarkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.\n“Ah, c’est vous!” said Pétya. “Voulez-vous manger? N’ayez pas peur, on\nne vous fera pas de mal,” * he added shyly and affectionately, touching the\nboy’s hand. “Entrez, entrez.” *(2)\n* “Ah, it’s you! Do you want something to eat? Don’t be afraid, they won’t hurt\nyou.”\n* (2) “Come in, come in.”\n“Merci, monsieur,” * said the drummer boy in a trembling almost\nchildish voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.\n* “Thank you, sir.”\nThere were many things Pétya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but did\nnot dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then in the\ndarkness he took the boy’s hand and pressed it.\n“Come in, come in!” he repeated in a gentle whisper. “Oh, what can I do\nfor him?” he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in first.\nWhen the boy had entered the hut, Pétya sat down at a distance from him,\nconsidering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him. But he fingered\nthe money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to\ngive some to the drummer boy."}, {"page": 1459, "text": "CHAPTER VIII\nThe arrival of Dólokhov diverted Pétya’s attention from the drummer\nboy, to whom Denísov had had some mutton and vodka given, and whom\nhe had had dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their\nband and not sent away with the other prisoners. Pétya had heard in the\narmy many stories of Dólokhov’s extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty\nto the French, so from the moment he entered the hut Pétya did not take his\neyes from him, but braced himself up more and more and held his head\nhigh, that he might not be unworthy even of such company.\nDólokhov’s appearance amazed Pétya by its simplicity.\nDenísov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas the\nWonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and everything he\ndid indicated his unusual position. But Dólokhov, who in Moscow had worn\na Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the\nGuards. He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman’s padded coat with an\nOrder of St. George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on\nhis head. He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room, and without\ngreeting anyone went up to Denísov and began questioning him about the\nmatter in hand. Denísov told him of the designs the large detachments had\non the transport, of the message Pétya had brought, and his own replies to\nboth generals. Then he told him all he knew of the French detachment.\n“That’s so. But we must know what troops they are and their numbers,”\nsaid Dólokhov. “It will be necessary to go there. We can’t start the affair\nwithout knowing for certain how many there are. I like to work accurately.\nHere now—wouldn’t one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the French\ncamp with me? I have brought a spare uniform.”\n“I, I... I’ll go with you!” cried Pétya.\n“There’s no need for you to go at all,” said Denísov, addressing\nDólokhov, “and as for him, I won’t let him go on any account.”"}, {"page": 1460, "text": "“I like that!” exclaimed Pétya. “Why shouldn’t I go?”\n“Because it’s useless.”\n“Well, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and that’s all.\nYou’ll take me, won’t you?” he said, turning to Dólokhov.\n“Why not?” Dólokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of the\nFrench drummer boy. “Have you had that youngster with you long?” he\nasked Denísov.\n“He was taken today but he knows nothing. I’m keeping him with me.”\n“Yes, and where do you put the others?” inquired Dólokhov.\n“Where? I send them away and take a weceipt for them,” shouted\nDenísov, suddenly flushing. “And I say boldly that I have not a single man’s\nlife on my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee\nhundwed men to town under escort, instead of staining—I speak bluntly—\nstaining the honor of a soldier?”\n“That kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of\nsixteen,” said Dólokhov with cold irony, “but it’s time for you to drop it.”\n“Why, I’ve not said anything! I only say that I’ll certainly go with you,”\nsaid Pétya shyly.\n“But for you and me, old fellow, it’s time to drop these amenities,”\ncontinued Dólokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this\nsubject which irritated Denísov. “Now, why have you kept this lad?” he\nwent on, swaying his head. “Because you are sorry for him! Don’t we know\nthose ‘receipts’ of yours? You send a hundred men away, and thirty get\nthere. The rest either starve or get killed. So isn’t it all the same not to send\nthem?”\nThe esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.\n“That’s not the point. I’m not going to discuss the matter. I do not wish to\ntake it on my conscience. You say they’ll die. All wight. Only not by my\nfault!”\nDólokhov began laughing.\n“Who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if\nthey did catch me they’d string me up to an aspen tree, and with all your\nchivalry just the same.” He paused. “However, we must get to work. Tell"}, {"page": 1461, "text": "the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms in it. Well, are you\ncoming with me?” he asked Pétya.\n“I? Yes, yes, certainly!” cried Pétya, blushing almost to tears and\nglancing at Denísov.\nWhile Dólokhov had been disputing with Denísov what should be done\nwith prisoners, Pétya had once more felt awkward and restless; but again he\nhad no time to grasp fully what they were talking about. “If grown-up,\ndistinguished men think so, it must be necessary and right,” thought he.\n“But above all Denísov must not dare to imagine that I’ll obey him and that\nhe can order me about. I will certainly go to the French camp with\nDólokhov. If he can, so can I!”\nAnd to all Denísov’s persuasions, Pétya replied that he too was\naccustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that he\nnever considered personal danger.\n“For you’ll admit that if we don’t know for sure how many of them there\nare... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are only two of us.\nBesides, I want to go very much and certainly will go, so don’t hinder me,”\nsaid he. “It will only make things worse....”"}, {"page": 1462, "text": "CHAPTER IX\nHaving put on French greatcoats and shakos, Pétya and Dólokhov rode to\nthe clearing from which Denísov had reconnoitered the French camp, and\nemerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow.\nOn reaching the bottom, Dólokhov told the Cossacks accompanying him to\nawait him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge.\nPétya, his heart in his mouth with excitement, rode by his side.\n“If we’re caught, I won’t be taken alive! I have a pistol,” whispered he.\n“Don’t talk Russian,” said Dólokhov in a hurried whisper, and at that\nvery moment they heard through the darkness the challenge: “Qui vive?” *\nand the click of a musket.\n* “Who goes there?”\nThe blood rushed to Pétya’s face and he grasped his pistol.\n“Lanciers du 6-me,” * replied Dólokhov, neither hastening nor\nslackening his horse’s pace.\n* “Lancers of the 6th Regiment.”\nThe black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.\n“Mot d’ordre.” *\n* “Password.”\nDólokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.\n“Dites donc, le colonel Gérard est ici?” * he asked.\n* “Tell me, is Colonel Gérard here?”\n“Mot d’ordre,” repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not replying.\n“Quand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas le mot\nd’ordre...” cried Dólokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight at the"}, {"page": 1463, "text": "sentinel. “Je vous demande si le colonel est ici.” *\n* “When an officer is making his round, sentinels don’t ask him for the\npassword.... I am asking you if the colonel is here.”\nAnd without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped\naside, Dólokhov rode up the incline at a walk.\nNoticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, Dólokhov stopped\nhim and inquired where the commander and officers were. The man, a\nsoldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to Dólokhov’s\nhorse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply and in a friendly way\nthat the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in\nthe courtyard of the farm, as he called the landowner’s house.\nHaving ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk could be\nheard around the campfires, Dólokhov turned into the courtyard of the\nlandowner’s house. Having ridden in, he dismounted and approached a big\nblazing campfire, around which sat several men talking noisily. Something\nwas boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a\npeaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by the fire, was kneeling beside it\nstirring its contents with a ramrod.\n“Oh, he’s a hard nut to crack,” said one of the officers who was sitting in\nthe shadow at the other side of the fire.\n“He’ll make them get a move on, those fellows!” said another, laughing.\nBoth fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of\nDólokhov’s and Pétya’s steps as they advanced to the fire leading their\nhorses.\n“Bonjour, messieurs!” * said Dólokhov loudly and clearly.\n* “Good day, gentlemen.”\nThere was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire, and\none tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, came up to Dólokhov.\n“Is that you, Clément?” he asked. “Where the devil...?” But, noticing his\nmistake, he broke off short and, with a frown, greeted Dólokhov as a\nstranger, asking what he could do for him.\nDólokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their\nregiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew\nanything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything, and Pétya"}, {"page": 1464, "text": "thought the officers were beginning to look at him and Dólokhov with\nhostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were silent.\n“If you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too late,” said\na voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.\nDólokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that\nnight.\nHe handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and\nsquatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long neck.\nThat officer did not take his eyes from Dólokhov and again asked to what\nregiment he belonged. Dólokhov, as if he had not heard the question, did\nnot reply, but lighting a short French pipe which he took from his pocket\nbegan asking the officer in how far the road before them was safe from\nCossacks.\n“Those brigands are everywhere,” replied an officer from behind the fire.\nDólokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers\nsuch as his companion and himself, “but probably they would not dare to\nattack large detachments?” he added inquiringly. No one replied.\n“Well, now he’ll come away,” Pétya thought every moment as he stood\nby the campfire listening to the talk.\nBut Dólokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began\nputting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion,\nhow many battalions, and how many prisoners. Asking about the Russian\nprisoners with that detachment, Dólokhov said:\n“A horrid business dragging these corpses about with one! It would be\nbetter to shoot such rabble,” and burst into loud laughter, so strange that\nPétya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise, and\ninvoluntarily took a step back from the campfire.\nNo one replied a word to Dólokhov’s laughter, and a French officer\nwhom they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and\nwhispered something to a companion. Dólokhov got up and called to the\nsoldier who was holding their horses.\n“Will they bring our horses or not?” thought Pétya, instinctively drawing\nnearer to Dólokhov.\nThe horses were brought."}, {"page": 1465, "text": "“Good evening, gentlemen,” said Dólokhov.\nPétya wished to say “Good night” but could not utter a word. The officers\nwere whispering together. Dólokhov was a long time mounting his horse\nwhich would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at a footpace. Pétya\nrode beside him, longing to look round to see whether or not the French\nwere running after them, but not daring to.\nComing out onto the road Dólokhov did not ride back across the open\ncountry, but through the village. At one spot he stopped and listened. “Do\nyou hear?” he asked. Pétya recognized the sound of Russian voices and saw\nthe dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires. When they had\ndescended to the bridge Pétya and Dólokhov rode past the sentinel, who\nwithout saying a word paced morosely up and down it, then they descended\ninto the hollow where the Cossacks awaited them.\n“Well now, good-by. Tell Denísov, ‘at the first shot at daybreak,’” said\nDólokhov and was about to ride away, but Pétya seized hold of him.\n“Really!” he cried, “you are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how splendid!\nHow I love you!”\n“All right, all right!” said Dólokhov. But Pétya did not let go of him and\nDólokhov saw through the gloom that Pétya was bending toward him and\nwanted to kiss him. Dólokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and\nvanished into the darkness."}, {"page": 1466, "text": "CHAPTER X\nHaving returned to the watchman’s hut, Pétya found Denísov in the\npassage. He was awaiting Pétya’s return in a state of agitation, anxiety, and\nself-reproach for having let him go.\n“Thank God!” he exclaimed. “Yes, thank God!” he repeated, listening to\nPétya’s rapturous account. “But, devil take you, I haven’t slept because of\nyou! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can still get a nap before\nmorning.”\n“But... no,” said Pétya, “I don’t want to sleep yet. Besides I know myself,\nif I fall asleep it’s finished. And then I am used to not sleeping before a\nbattle.”\nHe sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition\nand vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day.\nThen, noticing that Denísov was asleep, he rose and went out of doors.\nIt was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops were still\nfalling from the trees. Near the watchman’s hut the black shapes of the\nCossacks’ shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen. Behind\nthe hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them\nwere discernible, and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red. Not all\nthe Cossacks and hussars were asleep; here and there, amid the sounds of\nfalling drops and the munching of the horses near by, could be heard low\nvoices which seemed to be whispering.\nPétya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons.\nSomeone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses\nmunching their oats. In the dark Pétya recognized his own horse, which he\ncalled “Karabákh” though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to it.\n“Well, Karabákh! We’ll do some service tomorrow,” said he, sniffing its\nnostrils and kissing it."}, {"page": 1467, "text": "“Why aren’t you asleep, sir?” said a Cossack who was sitting under a\nwagon.\n“No, ah... Likhachëv—isn’t that your name? Do you know I have only\njust come back! We’ve been into the French camp.”\nAnd Pétya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but\nalso of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his life than to act\n“just anyhow.”\n“Well, you should get some sleep now,” said the Cossack.\n“No, I am used to this,” said Pétya. “I say, aren’t the flints in your pistols\nworn out? I brought some with me. Don’t you want any? You can have\nsome.”\nThe Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at\nPétya.\n“Because I am accustomed to doing everything accurately,” said Pétya.\n“Some fellows do things just anyhow, without preparation, and then they’re\nsorry for it afterwards. I don’t like that.”\n“Just so,” said the Cossack.\n“Oh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen my\nsaber for me? It’s got bl...” (Pétya feared to tell a lie, and the saber never\nhad been sharpened.) “Can you do it?”\n“Of course I can.”\nLikhachëv got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon Pétya heard the\nwarlike sound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon and sat on\nits edge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.\n“I say! Are the lads asleep?” asked Pétya.\n“Some are, and some aren’t—like us.”\n“Well, and that boy?”\n“Vesénny? Oh, he’s thrown himself down there in the passage. Fast\nasleep after his fright. He was that glad!”\nAfter that Pétya remained silent for a long time, listening to the sounds.\nHe heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared.\n“What are you sharpening?” asked a man coming up to the wagon.\n“Why, this gentleman’s saber.”"}, {"page": 1468, "text": "“That’s right,” said the man, whom Pétya took to be an hussar. “Was the\ncup left here?”\n“There, by the wheel!”\nThe hussar took the cup.\n“It must be daylight soon,” said he, yawning, and went away.\nPétya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Denísov’s\nguerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon captured\nfrom the French beside which horses were tethered, that under it Likhachëv\nwas sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark blotch to the right\nwas the watchman’s hut, and the red blotch below to the left was the dying\nembers of a campfire, that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar\nwho wanted a drink; but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all\nthis. He was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality. The big\ndark blotch might really be the watchman’s hut or it might be a cavern\nleading to the very depths of the earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it\nmight be the eye of an enormous monster. Perhaps he was really sitting on a\nwagon, but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a\nterribly high tower from which, if he fell, he would have to fall for a whole\nday or a whole month, or go on falling and never reach the bottom. Perhaps\nit was just the Cossack, Likhachëv, who was sitting under the wagon, but it\nmight be the kindest, bravest, most wonderful, most splendid man in the\nworld, whom no one knew of. It might really have been that the hussar\ncame for water and went back into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply\nvanished—disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness.\nNothing Pétya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was in\na fairy kingdom where everything was possible.\nHe looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth. It\nwas clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly sailing as if\nunveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing, and a\nclear black sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were\nclouds. Sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high, high overhead, and\nthen it seemed to sink so low that one could touch it with one’s hand.\nPétya’s eyes began to close and he swayed a little.\nThe trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed and\njostled one another. Someone snored."}, {"page": 1469, "text": "“Ozheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...” hissed the saber against the whetstone, and\nsuddenly Pétya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown,\nsweetly solemn hymn. Pétya was as musical as Natásha and more so than\nNicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the\nmelody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly\nfresh and attractive. The music became more and more audible. The melody\ngrew and passed from one instrument to another. And what was played was\na fugue—though Pétya had not the least conception of what a fugue is.\nEach instrument—now resembling a violin and now a horn, but better and\nclearer than violin or horn—played its own part, and before it had finished\nthe melody merged with another instrument that began almost the same air,\nand then with a third and a fourth; and they all blended into one and again\nbecame separate and again blended, now into solemn church music, now\ninto something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant.\n“Oh—why, that was in a dream!” Pétya said to himself, as he lurched\nforward. “It’s in my ears. But perhaps it’s music of my own. Well, go on,\nmy music! Now!...”\nHe closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance, sounds\nfluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and again all mingled\ninto the same sweet and solemn hymn. “Oh, this is delightful! As much as I\nlike and as I like!” said Pétya to himself. He tried to conduct that enormous\norchestra.\n“Now softly, softly die away!” and the sounds obeyed him. “Now fuller,\nmore joyful. Still more and more joyful!” And from an unknown depth rose\nincreasingly triumphant sounds. “Now voices join in!” ordered Pétya. And\nat first from afar he heard men’s voices and then women’s. The voices grew\nin harmonious triumphant strength, and Pétya listened to their surpassing\nbeauty in awe and joy.\nWith a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from the\ntrees, and the hissing of the saber, “Ozheg-zheg-zheg...” and again the\nhorses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing the choir but joining\nin it.\nPétya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all the time,\nwondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to share it.\nHe was awakened by Likhachëv’s kindly voice.\n“It’s ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in half with it!”"}, {"page": 1470, "text": "Pétya woke up.\n“It’s getting light, it’s really getting light!” he exclaimed.\nThe horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their\nvery tails, and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches. Pétya\nshook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it to\nLikhachëv; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and sheathed it. The\nCossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle girths.\n“And here’s the commander,” said Likhachëv.\nDenísov came out of the watchman’s hut and, having called Pétya, gave\norders to get ready."}, {"page": 1471, "text": "CHAPTER XI\nThe men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness, tightened\ntheir saddle girths, and formed companies. Denísov stood by the\nwatchman’s hut giving final orders. The infantry of the detachment passed\nalong the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early\ndawn, hundreds of feet splashing through the mud. The esaul gave some\norders to his men. Pétya held his horse by the bridle, impatiently awaiting\nthe order to mount. His face, having been bathed in cold water, was all\naglow, and his eyes were particularly brilliant. Cold shivers ran down his\nspine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically.\n“Well, is ev’wything weady?” asked Denísov. “Bwing the horses.”\nThe horses were brought. Denísov was angry with the Cossack because\nthe saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted. Pétya put his\nfoot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but Pétya\nleaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and, turning\nto look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him, rode up to\nDenísov.\n“Vasíli Dmítrich, entrust me with some commission! Please... for God’s\nsake...!” said he.\nDenísov seemed to have forgotten Pétya’s very existence. He turned to\nglance at him.\n“I ask one thing of you,” he said sternly, “to obey me and not shove\nyourself forward anywhere.”\nHe did not say another word to Pétya but rode in silence all the way.\nWhen they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing\nlight over the field. Denísov talked in whispers with the esaul and the\nCossacks rode past Pétya and Denísov. When they had all ridden by,\nDenísov touched his horse and rode down the hill. Slipping onto their\nhaunches and sliding, the horses descended with their riders into the ravine."}, {"page": 1472, "text": "Pétya rode beside Denísov, the pulsation of his body constantly increasing.\nIt was getting lighter and lighter, but the mist still hid distant objects.\nHaving reached the valley, Denísov looked back and nodded to a Cossack\nbeside him.\n“The signal!” said he.\nThe Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the tramp of\nhorses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from various sides, and\nthen more shots.\nAt the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, Pétya lashed his horse\nand loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding Denísov who shouted\nat him. It seemed to Pétya that at the moment the shot was fired it suddenly\nbecame as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge. Cossacks were\ngalloping along the road in front of him. On the bridge he collided with a\nCossack who had fallen behind, but he galloped on. In front of him soldiers,\nprobably Frenchmen, were running from right to left across the road. One\nof them fell in the mud under his horse’s feet.\nCossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From the\nmidst of that crowd terrible screams arose. Pétya galloped up, and the first\nthing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman, clutching\nthe handle of a lance that had been aimed at him.\n“Hurrah!... Lads!... ours!” shouted Pétya, and giving rein to his excited\nhorse he galloped forward along the village street.\nHe could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and ragged\nRussian prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road, were\nshouting something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking Frenchman,\nin a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red face, had been\ndefending himself against the hussars. When Pétya galloped up the\nFrenchman had already fallen. “Too late again!” flashed through Pétya’s\nmind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be\nheard. The shots came from the yard of the landowner’s house he had\nvisited the night before with Dólokhov. The French were making a stand\nthere behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with bushes and\nwere firing at the Cossacks who crowded at the gateway. Through the\nsmoke, as he approached the gate, Pétya saw Dólokhov, whose face was of\na pale-greenish tint, shouting to his men. “Go round! Wait for the infantry!”\nhe exclaimed as Pétya rode up to him."}, {"page": 1473, "text": "“Wait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!” shouted Pétya, and without pausing a moment\ngalloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the\nsmoke was thickest.\nA volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others plashed\nagainst something. The Cossacks and Dólokhov galloped after Pétya into\nthe gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke some of the\nFrench threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the\nCossacks, while others ran down the hill toward the pond. Pétya was\ngalloping along the courtyard, but instead of holding the reins he waved\nboth his arms about rapidly and strangely, slipping farther and farther to one\nside in his saddle. His horse, having galloped up to a campfire that was\nsmoldering in the morning light, stopped suddenly, and Pétya fell heavily\non to the wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked\nrapidly though his head was quite motionless. A bullet had pierced his skull.\nAfter speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the house\nwith a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that they\nsurrendered, Dólokhov dismounted and went up to Pétya, who lay\nmotionless with outstretched arms.\n“Done for!” he said with a frown, and went to the gate to meet Denísov\nwho was riding toward him.\n“Killed?” cried Denísov, recognizing from a distance the unmistakably\nlifeless attitude—very familiar to him—in which Pétya’s body was lying.\n“Done for!” repeated Dólokhov as if the utterance of these words\nafforded him pleasure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, who were\nsurrounded by Cossacks who had hurried up. “We won’t take them!” he\ncalled out to Denísov.\nDenísov did not reply; he rode up to Pétya, dismounted, and with\ntrembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespattered\nface which had already gone white.\n“I am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!” he\nrecalled Pétya’s words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise at the\nsound, like the yelp of a dog, with which Denísov turned away, walked to\nthe wattle fence, and seized hold of it.\nAmong the Russian prisoners rescued by Denísov and Dólokhov was\nPierre Bezúkhov."}, {"page": 1474, "text": "CHAPTER XII\nDuring the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been\nissued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners among\nwhom was Pierre.

Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front\nof the prisoners was left; they had all disappeared. The artillery the\nprisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now replaced\nby Marshal Junot’s enormous baggage train, convoyed by Westphalians.\nBehind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train.\nFrom Vyázma onwards the French army, which had till then moved in\nthree columns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder that\nPierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving Moscow had now\nreached the utmost limit.\nThe road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead\nhorses; ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments\ncontinually changed about, now joining the moving column, now again\nlagging behind it.\nSeveral times during the march false alarms had been given and the\nsoldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, and run headlong,\ncrushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled and abused each\nother for their causeless panic.\nThese three groups traveling together—the cavalry stores, the convoy of\nprisoners, and Junot’s baggage train—still constituted a separate and united\nwhole, though each of the groups was rapidly melting away.\nOf the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and\ntwenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been"}, {"page": 1475, "text": "captured or left behind. Some of Junot’s wagons also had been captured or\nabandoned. Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from\nDavout’s corps. From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned that a larger\nguard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the prisoners, and that\none of their comrades, a German soldier, had been shot by the marshal’s\nown order because a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had been found\nin his possession.\nThe group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the three hundred\nand thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a hundred now\nremained. The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the\ncavalry saddles or Junot’s baggage. They understood that the saddles and\nJunot’s spoon might be of some use, but that cold and hungry soldiers\nshould have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry Russians who froze\nand lagged behind on the road (in which case the order was to shoot them)\nwas not merely incomprehensible but revolting. And the escort, as if afraid,\nin the grievous condition they themselves were in, of giving way to the pity\nthey felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse,\ntreated them with particular moroseness and severity.\nAt Dorogobúzh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking the\nprisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores, several of the\nsoldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away, but were recaptured\nby the French and shot.\nThe arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer prisoners\nshould be kept separate from the rest, had long since been abandoned. All\nwho could walk went together, and after the third stage Pierre had rejoined\nKaratáev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen Karatáev for\nits master.\nOn the third day after leaving Moscow Karatáev again fell ill with the\nfever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he grew\ngradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre did not know why, but\nsince Karatáev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go\nnear him. When he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which\nKaratáev generally lay down at the halting places, and when he smelled the\nodor emanating from him which was now stronger than before, Pierre\nmoved farther away and did not think about him."}, {"page": 1476, "text": "While imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his intellect but\nwith his whole being, by life itself, that man is created for happiness, that\nhappiness is within him, in the satisfaction of simple human needs, and that\nall unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity. And now\nduring these last three weeks of the march he had learned still another new,\nconsolatory truth—that nothing in this world is terrible. He had learned that\nas there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely free, so\nthere is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack freedom. He\nlearned that suffering and freedom have their limits and that those limits are\nvery near together; that the person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal\nsuffered as keenly as he now, sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side\ngrowing chilled while the other was warming; and that when he had put on\ntight dancing shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with\nbare feet that were covered with sores—his footgear having long since\nfallen to pieces. He discovered that when he had married his wife—of his\nown free will as it had seemed to him—he had been no more free than now\nwhen they locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself\nsubsequently termed his sufferings, but which at the time he scarcely felt,\nthe worst was the state of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet. (The\nhorseflesh was appetizing and nourishing, the saltpeter flavor of the\ngunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant; there was no great\ncold, it was always warm walking in the daytime, and at night there were\nthe campfires; the lice that devoured him warmed his body.) The one thing\nthat was at first hard to bear was his feet.\nAfter the second day’s march Pierre, having examined his feet by the\ncampfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; but when\neverybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he had warmed up,\nwalked without feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more terrible\nto look at than before. However, he did not look at them now, but thought of\nother things.\nOnly now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the saving\npower he has of transferring his attention from one thing to another, which\nis like the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to blow off\nwhen the pressure exceeds a certain limit.\nHe did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged\nbehind, though more than a hundred perished in that way. He did not think"}, {"page": 1477, "text": "of Karatáev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon have to\nshare that fate. Still less did Pierre think about himself.

Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then\nagain at his feet. The former and the latter were alike familiar and his own.\nThe blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the road,\nsometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction lifting one hind leg\nand hopping along on three, and then again going on all four and rushing to\nbark at the crows that sat on the carrion. The dog was merrier and sleeker\nthan it had been in Moscow. All around lay the flesh of different animals—\nfrom men to horses—in various stages of decomposition; and as the wolves\nwere kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted.\nIt had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it\nmight cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began raining harder\nthan before. The saturated road no longer absorbed the water, which ran\nalong the ruts in streams.\nPierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his steps in\nthrees, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally addressing the rain,\nhe repeated: “Now then, now then, go on! Pelt harder!”\nIt seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far down and deep\nwithin him his soul was occupied with something important and\ncomforting. This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a\nconversation with Karatáev the day before.\nAt their yesterday’s halting place, feeling chilly by a dying campfire,\nPierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was burning better. There\nPlatón Karatáev was sitting covered up—head and all—with his greatcoat\nas if it were a vestment, telling the soldiers in his effective and pleasant\nthough now feeble voice a story Pierre knew. It was already past midnight,\nthe hour when Karatáev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively."}, {"page": 1479, "text": "When Pierre reached the fire and heard Platón’s voice enfeebled by illness,\nand saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick\nat his heart. His feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to\ngo away, but there was no other fire, and Pierre sat down, trying not to look\nat Platón.\n“Well, how are you?” he asked.\n“How am I? If we grumble at sickness, God won’t grant us death,”\nreplied Platón, and at once resumed the story he had begun.\n“And so, brother,” he continued, with a smile on his pale emaciated face\nand a particularly happy light in his eyes, “you see, brother...”\nPierre had long been familiar with that story. Karatáev had told it to him\nalone some half-dozen times and always with a specially joyful emotion.\nBut well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to that tale as to something new,\nand the quiet rapture Karatáev evidently felt as he told it communicated\nitself also to Pierre. The story was of an old merchant who lived a good and\nGod-fearing life with his family, and who went once to the Nízhni fair with\na companion—a rich merchant.\nHaving put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next morning his\ncompanion was found robbed and with his throat cut. A bloodstained knife\nwas found under the old merchant’s pillow. He was tried, knouted, and his\nnostrils having been torn off, “all in due form” as Karatáev put it, he was\nsent to hard labor in Siberia.\n“And so, brother” (it was at this point that Pierre came up), “ten years or\nmore passed by. The old man was living as a convict, submitting as he\nshould and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God for death. Well, one\nnight the convicts were gathered just as we are, with the old man among\nthem. And they began telling what each was suffering for, and how they had\nsinned against God. One told how he had taken a life, another had taken\ntwo, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply been a vagrant\nand had done nothing. So they asked the old man: ‘What are you being\npunished for, Daddy?’—‘I, my dear brothers,’ said he, ‘am being punished\nfor my own and other men’s sins. But I have not killed anyone or taken\nanything that was not mine, but have only helped my poorer brothers. I was\na merchant, my dear brothers, and had much property. ‘And he went on to\ntell them all about it in due order. ‘I don’t grieve for myself,’ he says, ‘God,\nit seems, has chastened me. Only I am sorry for my old wife and the"}, {"page": 1480, "text": "children,’ and the old man began to weep. Now it happened that in the\ngroup was the very man who had killed the other merchant. ‘Where did it\nhappen, Daddy?’ he said. ‘When, and in what month?’ He asked all about it\nand his heart began to ache. So he comes up to the old man like this, and\nfalls down at his feet! ‘You are perishing because of me, Daddy,’ he says.\n‘It’s quite true, lads, that this man,’ he says, ‘is being tortured innocently\nand for nothing! I,’ he says, ‘did that deed, and I put the knife under your\nhead while you were asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,’ he says, ‘for Christ’s\nsake!’”\nKaratáev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, and he drew\nthe logs together.\n“And the old man said, ‘God will forgive you, we are all sinners in His\nsight. I suffer for my own sins,’ and he wept bitter tears. Well, and what do\nyou think, dear friends?” Karatáev continued, his face brightening more and\nmore with a rapturous smile as if what he now had to tell contained the\nchief charm and the whole meaning of his story: “What do you think, dear\nfellows? That murderer confessed to the authorities. ‘I have taken six lives,’\nhe says (he was a great sinner), ‘but what I am most sorry for is this old\nman. Don’t let him suffer because of me.’ So he confessed and it was all\nwritten down and the papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way\noff, and while they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in\nthe papers all in due form—the authorities I mean—time passed. The affair\nreached the Tsar. After a while the Tsar’s decree came: to set the merchant\nfree and give him a compensation that had been awarded. The paper arrived\nand they began to look for the old man. ‘Where is the old man who has\nbeen suffering innocently and in vain? A paper has come from the Tsar!’ so\nthey began looking for him,” here Karatáev’s lower jaw trembled, “but God\nhad already forgiven him—he was dead! That’s how it was, dear fellows!”\nKaratáev concluded and sat for a long time silent, gazing before him with a\nsmile.\nAnd Pierre’s soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself but\nby its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that lit up Karatáev’s\nface as he told it, and the mystic significance of that joy."}, {"page": 1481, "text": "CHAPTER XIV\n“À vos places!” * suddenly cried a voice.\n* “To your places.”\nA pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful\nand solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the\nprisoners. From all sides came shouts of command, and from the left came\nsmartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing the prisoners at a trot.\nThe expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the approach\nof those in authority. The prisoners thronged together and were pushed off\nthe road. The convoy formed up.\n“The Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!” and hardly had\nthe sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled\nby. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with a tranquil\nlook on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of the marshals. His\neye fell on Pierre’s large and striking figure, and in the expression with\nwhich he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he detected sympathy\nand a desire to conceal that sympathy.\nThe general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a red\nand frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several officers formed\na group and some soldiers crowded round them. Their faces all looked\nexcited and worried.\n“What did he say? What did he say?” Pierre heard them ask.\nWhile the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in a\ncrowd, and Pierre saw Karatáev whom he had not yet seen that morning. He\nsat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On his face, besides the\nlook of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling the tale of the\nmerchant who suffered innocently, there was now an expression of quiet\nsolemnity."}, {"page": 1482, "text": "Karatáev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with\ntears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to\nhim. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself. He made as if he did\nnot notice that look and moved hastily away.\nWhen the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round. Karatáev\nwas still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two\nFrenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look round again but\nwent limping up the hill.\nFrom behind, where Karatáev had been sitting, came the sound of a shot.\nPierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that he had not\nyet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to Smolénsk—a\ncalculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And he again started\nreckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one of whom carried a\nlowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and in the expression on\ntheir faces—one of them glanced timidly at Pierre—there was something\nresembling what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at the\nexecution. Pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that, two days\nbefore, that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and how\nthey had laughed at him.\nBehind him, where Karatáev had been sitting, the dog began to howl.\n“What a stupid beast! Why is it howling?” thought Pierre.\nHis comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided looking\nback at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling,\njust as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their faces."}, {"page": 1483, "text": "CHAPTER XV\nThe stores, the prisoners, and the marshal’s baggage train stopped at the\nvillage of Shámshevo. The men crowded together round the campfires.\nPierre went up to the fire, ate some roast horseflesh, lay down with his back\nto the fire, and immediately fell asleep. He again slept as he had done at\nMozháysk after the battle of Borodinó.\nAgain real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or\nanother, gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts that\nhad been expressed in his dream at Mozháysk.\n“Life is everything. Life is God. Everything changes and moves and that\nmovement is God. And while there is life there is joy in consciousness of\nthe divine. To love life is to love God. Harder and more blessed than all else\nis to love this life in one’s sufferings, in innocent sufferings.”\n“Karatáev!” came to Pierre’s mind.\nAnd suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten, kindly old man\nwho had given him geography lessons in Switzerland. “Wait a bit,” said the\nold man, and showed Pierre a globe. This globe was alive—a vibrating ball\nwithout fixed dimensions. Its whole surface consisted of drops closely\npressed together, and all these drops moved and changed places, sometimes\nseveral of them merging into one, sometimes one dividing into many. Each\ndrop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as possible, but others\nstriving to do the same compressed it, sometimes destroyed it, and\nsometimes merged with it.\n“That is life,” said the old teacher.\n“How simple and clear it is,” thought Pierre. “How is it I did not know it\nbefore?”\n“God is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect Him to\nthe greatest extent. And it grows, merges, disappears from the surface, sinks"}, {"page": 1484, "text": "to the depths, and again emerges. There now, Karatáev has spread out and\ndisappeared. Do you understand, my child?” said the teacher.\n“Do you understand, damn you?” shouted a voice, and Pierre woke up.\nHe lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had just pushed a Russian\nsoldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting a piece of meat\nstuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy, hairy, red\nhands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod. His brown morose\nface with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal.\n“It’s all the same to him,” he muttered, turning quickly to a soldier who\nstood behind him. “Brigand! Get away!”\nAnd twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who turned away\nand gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier the Frenchman\nhad pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting something with his hand.\nLooking more closely Pierre recognized the blue-gray dog, sitting beside\nthe soldier, wagging its tail.\n“Ah, he’s come?” said Pierre. “And Plat—” he began, but did not finish.\nSuddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy—\nof the look Platón had given him as he sat under the tree, of the shot heard\nfrom that spot, of the dog’s howl, of the guilty faces of the two Frenchmen\nas they ran past him, of the lowered and smoking gun, and of Karatáev’s\nabsence at this halt—and he was on the point of realizing that Karatáev had\nbeen killed, but just at that instant, he knew not why, the recollection came\nto his mind of a summer evening he had spent with a beautiful Polish lady\non the veranda of his house in Kiev. And without linking up the events of\nthe day or drawing a conclusion from them, Pierre closed his eyes, seeing a\nvision of the country in summertime mingled with memories of bathing and\nof the liquid, vibrating globe, and he sank into water so that it closed over\nhis head.\nBefore sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing.\nFrench soldiers were running past him.\n“The Cossacks!” one of them shouted, and a moment later a crowd of\nRussians surrounded Pierre.\nFor a long time he could not understand what was happening to him. All\naround he heard his comrades sobbing with joy."}, {"page": 1485, "text": "“Brothers! Dear fellows!

He hugged the first soldier who\napproached him, and kissed him, weeping.\nDólokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a crowd of\ndisarmed Frenchmen pass by.

On the opposite side stood\nDólokhov’s Cossack, counting the prisoners and marking off each hundred\nwith a chalk line on the gate.\n“How many?” Dólokhov asked the Cossack.\n“The second hundred,” replied the Cossack.\n“Filez, filez!” * Dólokhov kept saying, having adopted this expression\nfrom the French, and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they flashed\nwith a cruel light.\n* “Get along, get along!”\nDenísov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some\nCossacks who were carrying the body of Pétya Rostóv to a hole that had\nbeen dug in the garden."}, {"page": 1486, "text": "CHAPTER XVI\nAfter the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, the flight of\nthe French assumed a still more tragic character, with men freezing, or\nroasting themselves to death at the campfires, while carriages with people\ndressed in furs continued to drive past, carrying away the property that had\nbeen stolen by the Emperor, kings, and dukes; but the process of the flight\nand disintegration of the French army went on essentially as before.\nFrom Moscow to Vyázma the French army of seventy-three thousand\nmen not reckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole war but\npillage) was reduced to thirty-six thousand, though not more than five\nthousand had fallen in battle. From this beginning the succeeding terms of\nthe progression could be determined mathematically. The French army\nmelted away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to Vyázma, from\nVyázma to Smolénsk, from Smolénsk to the Berëzina, and from the\nBerëzina to Vílna—independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the\ncold, the pursuit, the barring of the way, or any other particular conditions.\nBeyond Vyázma the French army instead of moving in three columns\nhuddled together into one mass, and so went on to the end.

First\nhe rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into a tight place he runs away\nas quietly as he can, and often thinking to escape runs straight into his\nopponent’s arms.\nAt first while they were still moving along the Kalúga road, Napoleon’s\narmies made their presence known, but later when they reached the\nSmolénsk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight—and often\nthinking they were escaping ran right into the Russians.\nOwing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit and the\nconsequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means of approximately\nascertaining the enemy’s position—by cavalry scouting—was not available.\nBesides, as a result of the frequent and rapid change of position by each\narmy, even what information was obtained could not be delivered in time.

So one might have thought that\nregarding this period of the campaign the historians, who attributed the\nactions of the mass to the will of one man, would have found it impossible\nto make the story of the retreat fit their theory.

Similarly profound considerations are given for his retreat\nfrom Smolénsk to Orshá.

Can the French be so enormously superior to us that when we had\nsurrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them? How could\nthat happen?\nHistory (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions says\nthat this occurred because Kutúzov and Tormásov and Chichagóv, and this\nman and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers....\nBut why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they were\nguilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and\npunished?

So what was the use of performing various\noperations on the French who were running away as fast as they possibly\ncould?\nSecondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men\nwhose whole energy was directed to flight.\nThirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice one’s own troops in\norder to destroy the French army, which without external interference was\ndestroying itself at such a rate that, though its path was not blocked, it could"}, {"page": 1494, "text": "not carry across the frontier more than it actually did in December, namely\na hundredth part of the original army.\nFourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the\nEmperor, kings, and dukes—whose capture would have been in the highest\ndegree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most adroit diplomatists of the\ntime (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized. Still more senseless would\nhave been the wish to capture army corps of the French, when our own\narmy had melted away to half before reaching Krásnoe and a whole\ndivision would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners, and\nwhen our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already\ntaken were perishing of hunger.\nAll the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his\narmy were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving out of his\ngarden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted, should run to\nthe gate and hit the cow on the head. The only thing to be said in excuse of\nthat gardener would be that he was very angry. But not even that could be\nsaid for those who drew up this project, for it was not they who had suffered\nfrom the trampled beds.\nBut besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would have\nbeen senseless, it was impossible.\nIt was impossible first because—as experience shows that a three-mile\nmovement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans—the\nprobability of Chichagóv, Kutúzov, and Wittgenstein effecting a junction on\ntime at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to\nimpossibility, as in fact thought Kutúzov, who when he received the plan\nremarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the\ndesired results.\nSecondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with\nwhich Napoleon’s army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than the\nRussians possessed would have been required.\nThirdly it was impossible, because the military term “to cut off” has no\nmeaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. To cut off an\narmy—to bar its road—is quite impossible, for there is always plenty of\nroom to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be seen, as\nthe military scientists might convince themselves by the example of\nKrásnoe and of the Berëzina.

Men can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according\nto the rules of strategy and tactics, as the Germans did. But the French\ntroops quite rightly did not consider that this suited them, since death by\nhunger and cold awaited them in flight or captivity alike.\nFourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the world\nbegan has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained in\n1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the French strained its strength\nto the utmost and could not have done more without destroying itself.\nDuring the movement of the Russian army from Tarútino to Krásnoe it\nlost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to the\npopulation of a large provincial town. Half the men fell out of the army\nwithout a battle.\nAnd it is of this period of the campaign—when the army lacked boots\nand sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and was\ncamping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of frost,\nwhen there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the rest was\nnight in which the influence of discipline cannot be maintained, when men\nwere taken into that region of death where discipline fails, not for a few\nhours only as in a battle, but for months, where they were every moment\nfighting death from hunger and cold, when half the army perished in a\nsingle month—it is of this period of the campaign that the historians tell us\nhow Milorádovich should have made a flank march to such and such a\nplace, Tormásov to another place, and Chichagóv should have crossed\n(more than knee-deep in snow) to somewhere else, and how so-and-so\n“routed” and “cut off” the French and so on and so on.\nThe Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should have been\ndone to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not to blame\nbecause other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed that they should\ndo what was impossible.\nAll that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the\nfacts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians dealing\nwith the matter have written the history of the beautiful words and\nsentiments of various generals, and not the history of the events.\nTo them the words of Milorádovich seem very interesting, and so do their\nsurmises and the rewards this or that general received; but the question of"}, {"page": 1496, "text": "those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves does not\neven interest them, for it does not come within the range of their\ninvestigation.\nYet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and\nconsider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a\ndirect part in the events, and all the questions that seemed insoluble easily\nand simply receive an immediate and certain solution.\nThe aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in the\nimaginations of a dozen people.

The wound had begun to heal from within.\nAt the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count\ninsisted on Natásha’s going with her to consult the doctors."}, {"page": 1509, "text": "CHAPTER IV\nAfter the encounter at Vyázma, where Kutúzov had been unable to hold\nback his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so\non, the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the Russians who\npursued them, continued as far as Krásnoe without a battle. The flight was\nso rapid that the Russian army pursuing the French could not keep up with\nthem; cavalry and artillery horses broke down, and the information received\nof the movements of the French was never reliable.\nThe men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous\nmarching at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not go any\nfaster.\nTo realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only\nnecessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not losing\nmore than five thousand killed and wounded after Tarútino and less than a\nhundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that place a hundred\nthousand strong reached Krásnoe with only fifty thousand.\nThe rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army as\nthe flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference was that the\nRussian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction as hung\nover the French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind in enemy\nhands while the sick Russians left behind were among their own people.\nThe chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon’s army was the rapidity of its\nmovement, and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of\nthe Russian army.\nKutúzov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the\nmovement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian\narmy generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at Tarútino\nand Vyázma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army."}, {"page": 1510, "text": "But besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the\narmy caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident, another\nreason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to Kutúzov. The\naim of the Russian army was to pursue the French. The road the French\nwould take was unknown, and so the closer our troops trod on their heels\nthe greater distance they had to cover. Only by following at some distance\ncould one cut across the zigzag path of the French. All the artful maneuvers\nsuggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a\nlengthening of its marches, whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten\nthose marches. To that end Kutúzov’s activity was directed during the\nwhole campaign from Moscow to Vílna—not casually or intermittently but\nso consistently that he never once deviated from it.\nKutúzov felt and knew—not by reasoning or science but with the whole\nof his Russian being—what every Russian soldier felt: that the French were\nbeaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven out; but at the same\ntime he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march, the rapidity\nof which was unparalleled for such a time of the year.\nBut to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian army, who\nwished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, and for some\nreason to capture a king or a duke—it seemed that now—when any battle\nmust be horrible and senseless—was the very time to fight and conquer\nsomebody. Kutúzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another\nthey presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers—ill-\nshod, insufficiently clad, and half starved—who within a month and without\nfighting a battle had dwindled to half their number, and who at the best if\nthe flight continued would have to go a greater distance than they had\nalready traversed, before they reached the frontier.\nThis longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, and to\ncut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians stumbled on the\nFrench army.\nSo it was at Krásnoe, where they expected to find one of the three French\ncolumns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen thousand\nmen. Despite all Kutúzov’s efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to\npreserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob of French soldiers by\nworn-out Russians continued at Krásnoe for three days."}, {"page": 1511, "text": "Toll wrote a disposition: “The first column will march to so and so,” etc.\nAnd as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition. Prince\nEugène of Württemberg fired from a hill over the French crowds that were\nrunning past, and demanded reinforcements which did not arrive.

The\nEmperor was dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written by\norder of the Highest Authorities it is said that Kutúzov was a cunning court\nliar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by his blunders at\nKrásnoe and the Berëzina he deprived the Russian army of the glory of\ncomplete victory over the French. *\n* History of the year 1812.

The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for\ndiscerning the higher laws.\nFor Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleon—that most\ninsignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile, showed\nhuman dignity—Napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm; he is\ngrand. But Kutúzov—the man who from the beginning to the end of his\nactivity in 1812, never once swerving by word or deed from Borodinó to\nVílna, presented an example exceptional in history of self-sacrifice and a\npresent consciousness of the future importance of what was happening—\nKutúzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful, and when speaking\nof him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little ashamed.\nAnd yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity\nwas so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be difficult to\nimagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole\npeople. Still more difficult would it be to find an instance in history of the\naim of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as that to\nwhich all Kutúzov’s efforts were directed in 1812."}, {"page": 1514, "text": "Kutúzov never talked of “forty centuries looking down from the\nPyramids,” of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of what he\nintended to accomplish or had accomplished; in general he said nothing\nabout himself, adopted no pose, always appeared to be the simplest and\nmost ordinary of men, and said the simplest and most ordinary things. He\nwrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de Staël, read novels, liked the\nsociety of pretty women, jested with generals, officers, and soldiers, and\nnever contradicted those who tried to prove anything to him. When Count\nRostopchín at the Yaúza bridge galloped up to Kutúzov with personal\nreproaches for having caused the destruction of Moscow, and said: “How\nwas it you promised not to abandon Moscow without a battle?” Kutúzov\nreplied: “And I shall not abandon Moscow without a battle,” though\nMoscow was then already abandoned. When Arakchéev, coming to him\nfrom the Emperor, said that Ermólov ought to be appointed chief of the\nartillery, Kutúzov replied: “Yes, I was just saying so myself,” though a\nmoment before he had said quite the contrary. What did it matter to him—\nwho then alone amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous\nsignificance of what was happening—what did it matter to him whether\nRostopchín attributed the calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still\nless could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery.\nNot merely in these cases but continually did that old man—who by\nexperience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words\nserving as their expression are not what move people—use quite\nmeaningless words that happened to enter his head.\nBut that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the whole\ntime of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward\nwhich he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite of himself,\nin very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts\nwith the bitter conviction that he would not be understood. Beginning with\nthe battle of Borodinó, from which time his disagreement with those about\nhim began, he alone said that the battle of Borodinó was a victory, and\nrepeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time\nof his death. He alone said that the loss of Moscow is not the loss of Russia.\nIn reply to Lauriston’s proposal of peace, he said: There can be no peace,\nfor such is the people’s will. He alone during the retreat of the French said\nthat all our maneuvers are useless, everything is being accomplished of\nitself better than we could desire; that the enemy must be offered “a golden"}, {"page": 1515, "text": "bridge”; that neither the Tarútino, the Vyázma, nor the Krásnoe battles were\nnecessary; that we must keep some force to reach the frontier with, and that\nhe would not sacrifice a single Russian for ten Frenchmen.\nAnd this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to Arakchéev to\nplease the Emperor, he alone—incurring thereby the Emperor’s displeasure\n—said in Vílna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is useless and\nharmful.\nNor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the\nevents. His actions—without the smallest deviation—were all directed to\none and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his strength for conflict with\nthe French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive them out of Russia,\nminimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people and of our army.\nThis procrastinator Kutúzov, whose motto was “Patience and Time,” this\nenemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodinó, investing the\npreparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kutúzov who before\nthe battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in\ncontradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that Borodinó was a\nvictory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite\nthe fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was\nunprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles,\nwhich were useless then, should not be fought, and that a new war should\nnot be begun nor the frontiers of Russia crossed.\nIt is easy now to understand the significance of these events—if only we\nabstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in\nthe heads of a dozen individuals—for the events and results now lie before\nus.\nBut how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion, so\ntruly discern the importance of the people’s view of the events that in all his\nactivity he was never once untrue to it?\nThe source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the\nevents then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full\npurity and strength.\nOnly the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the\npeople in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar’s wish, to select him—\nan old man in disfavor—to be their representative in the national war.

Kutúzov rode to Dóbroe on his plump little\nwhite horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who\nwhispered among themselves behind his back.

At the approach of the commander\nin chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on Kutúzov who,\nwearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on\nhis round shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his white horse. One\nof the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had been\ncaptured.\nKutúzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was\nsaying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed\nattentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a specially\nwretched appearance.

He puckered his\nface, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head. At another spot\nhe noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a Frenchman on the\nshoulder, saying something to him in a friendly manner, and Kutúzov with\nthe same expression on his face again swayed his head.\n“What were you saying?” he asked the general, who continuing his report\ndirected the commander in chief’s attention to some standards captured\nfrom the French and standing in front of the Preobrazhénsk regiment.\n“Ah, the standards!” said Kutúzov, evidently detaching himself with\ndifficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.\nHe looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking at him\nfrom all sides awaiting a word from him.\nHe stopped in front of the Preobrazhénsk regiment, sighed deeply, and\nclosed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the\nstandards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them.\nKutúzov was silent for a few seconds and then, submitting with evident\nreluctance to the duty imposed by his position, raised his head and began to\nspeak. A throng of officers surrounded him. He looked attentively around at\nthe circle of officers, recognizing several of them.\n“I thank you all!” he said, addressing the soldiers and then again the\nofficers. In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were distinctly\nheard. “I thank you all for your hard and faithful service. The victory is\ncomplete and Russia will not forget you! Honor to you forever.”\nHe paused and looked around.\n“Lower its head, lower it!” he said to a soldier who had accidentally\nlowered the French eagle he was holding before the Preobrazhénsk\nstandards. “Lower, lower, that’s it. Hurrah lads!” he added, addressing the\nmen with a rapid movement of his chin.\n“Hur-r-rah!” roared thousands of voices.\nWhile the soldiers were shouting Kutúzov leaned forward in his saddle\nand bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic\ngleam."}, {"page": 1519, "text": "“You see, brothers...” said he when the shouts had ceased... and all at\nonce his voice and the expression of his face changed.

They make soldiers of all classes there.”\n“But they don’t understand our talk at all,” said the dancer with a puzzled\nsmile. “I asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbered in his own way.\nA queer lot!”\n“But it’s strange, friends,” continued the man who had wondered at their\nwhiteness, “the peasants at Mozháysk were saying that when they began\nburying the dead—where the battle was you know—well, those dead had\nbeen lying there for nearly a month, and says the peasant, ‘they lie as white\nas paper, clean, and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke.’”\n“Was it from the cold?” asked someone.\n“You’re a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If it had\nbeen from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. ‘But,’ he says, ‘go up\nto ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,’ he says, ‘we tie our faces\nup with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag them off: we can\nhardly do it. But theirs,’ he says, ‘are white as paper and not so much smell\nas a whiff of gunpowder.’”\nAll were silent.\n“It must be from their food,” said the sergeant major. “They used to\ngobble the same food as the gentry.”\nNo one contradicted him.\n“That peasant near Mozháysk where the battle was said the men were all\ncalled up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and still\ndidn’t finish carting the dead away. And as for the wolves, he says...”"}, {"page": 1526, "text": "“That was a real battle,” said an old soldier. “It’s the only one worth\nremembering; but since that... it’s only been tormenting folk.”\n“And do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them and,\nmy word, they didn’t let us get near before they just threw down their\nmuskets and went on their knees. ‘Pardon!’ they say. That’s only one case.\nThey say Plátov took ‘Poleon himself twice. But he didn’t know the right\ncharm. He catches him and catches him—no good! He turns into a bird in\nhis hands and flies away.

They\ncame up to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers\ndid not understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an officer’s hat\nand seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he had been going to\nsit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied round\nhis head, was stronger. He raised his companion and said something,\npointing to his mouth. The soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen, spread a\ngreatcoat on the ground for the sick man, and brought some buckwheat\nporridge and vodka for both of them.\nThe exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his head\nwrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.\nWhen Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he\nsuddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the\nsoldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused food and resting\nhis head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire, looking at the Russian\nsoldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally he emitted a long-drawn\ngroan and then again became silent. Morel, pointing to his shoulders, tried\nto impress on the soldiers the fact that Ramballe was an officer and ought to\nbe warmed.

Why talk rubbish, lout that you are—a real peasant!”\ncame rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.\nThey surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of two\nsoldiers, and carried him to the hut.

If so much has been and still is\nwritten about the Berëzina, on the French side this is only because at the\nbroken bridge across that river the calamities their army had been\npreviously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a\ntragic spectacle that remained in every memory, and on the Russian side\nmerely because in Petersburg—far from the seat of war—a plan (again one\nof Pfuel’s) had been devised to catch Napoleon in a strategic trap at the\nBerëzina River. Everyone assured himself that all would happen according\nto plan, and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of the Berëzina\nthat destroyed the French army. In reality the results of the crossing were\nmuch less disastrous to the French—in guns and men lost—than Krásnoe\nhad been, as the figures show.\nThe sole importance of the crossing of the Berëzina lies in the fact that it\nplainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for cutting off the\nenemy’s retreat and the soundness of the only possible line of action—the\none Kutúzov and the general mass of the army demanded—namely, simply\nto follow the enemy up. The French crowd fled at a continually increasing\nspeed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal. It fled like a\nwounded animal and it was impossible to block its path. This was shown\nnot so much by the arrangements it made for crossing as by what took place\nat the bridges. When the bridges broke down, unarmed soldiers, people\nfrom Moscow and women with children who were with the French\ntransport, all—carried on by vis inertiæ—pressed forward into boats and\ninto the ice-covered water and did not surrender.\nThat impulse was reasonable.

But those who surrendered, while remaining in the same pitiful\nplight, would be on a lower level to claim a share in the necessities of life.\nThe French did not need to be informed of the fact that half the prisoners—\nwith whom the Russians did not know what to do—perished of cold and\nhunger despite their captors’ desire to save them; they felt that it could not\nbe otherwise. The most compassionate Russian commanders, those\nfavorable to the French—and even the Frenchmen in the Russian service—\ncould do nothing for the prisoners. The French perished from the conditions\nto which the Russian army was itself exposed. It was impossible to take\nbread and clothes from our hungry and indispensable soldiers to give to the\nFrench who, though not harmful, or hated, or guilty, were simply\nunnecessary. Some Russians even did that, but they were exceptions.\nCertain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was hope.\nTheir ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in collective\nflight, and on that the whole strength of the French was concentrated.\nThe farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the\nremnant, especially after the Berëzina, on which (in consequence of the\nPetersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians, and the\nkeener grew the passions of the Russian commanders, who blamed one\nanother and Kutúzov most of all. Anticipation that the failure of the\nPetersburg Berëzina plan would be attributed to Kutúzov led to\ndissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more strongly expressed.\nThe ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a respectful form,\nmaking it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to blame. They did not\ntalk seriously to him; when reporting to him or asking for his sanction they\nappeared to be fulfilling a regrettable formality, but they winked behind his\nback and tried to mislead him at every turn.\nBecause they could not understand him all these people assumed that it\nwas useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grasp the profundity\nof their plans, that he would answer with his phrases (which they thought\nwere mere phrases) about a “golden bridge,” about the impossibility of\ncrossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions, and so forth. They had\nheard all that before. And all he said—that it was necessary to await\nprovisions, or that the men had no boots—was so simple, while what they"}, {"page": 1533, "text": "proposed was so complicated and clever, that it was evident that he was old\nand stupid and that they, though not in power, were commanders of genius.\nAfter the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg\nhero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their\nmaximum. Kutúzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders.\nOnly once, after the affair of the Berëzina, did he get angry and write to\nBennigsen (who reported separately to the Emperor) the following letter:\n“On account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency please be so\ngood as to set off for Kalúga on receipt of this, and there await further\ncommands and appointments from His Imperial Majesty.”\nBut after Bennigsen’s departure, the Grand Duke Tsarévich Constantine\nPávlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the beginning of the\ncampaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by Kutúzov.\nNow having come to the army, he informed Kutúzov of the Emperor’s\ndispleasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their\nadvance. The Emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days’\ntime.\nThe old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairs—this\nsame Kutúzov who in August had been chosen commander in chief against\nthe sovereign’s wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and heir-\napparent from the army—who on his own authority and contrary to the\nEmperor’s will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, now realized\nat once that his day was over, that his part was played, and that the power\nhe was supposed to hold was no longer his. And he understood this not\nmerely from the attitude of the court. He saw on the one hand that the\nmilitary business in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his\nmission was accomplished; and at the same time he began to be conscious\nof the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical\nrest.\nOn the twenty-ninth of November Kutúzov entered Vílna—his “dear\nVílna” as he called it. Twice during his career Kutúzov had been governor\nof Vílna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old\nfriends and associations, besides the comforts of life of which he had so\nlong been deprived.

In undress naval uniform, with a\ndirk, and holding his cap under his arm, he handed Kutúzov a garrison\nreport and the keys of the town. The contemptuously respectful attitude of\nthe younger men to the old man in his dotage was expressed in the highest\ndegree by the behavior of Chichagóv, who knew of the accusations that\nwere being directed against Kutúzov.\nWhen speaking to Chichagóv, Kutúzov incidentally mentioned that the\nvehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at Borísov had\nbeen recovered and would be restored to him.\n“You mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the contrary, I\ncan supply you with everything even if you want to give dinner parties,”\nwarmly replied Chichagóv, who tried by every word he spoke to prove his\nown rectitude and therefore imagined Kutúzov to be animated by the same\ndesire.\nKutúzov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle penetrating\nsmile: “I meant merely to say what I said.”\nContrary to the Emperor’s wish Kutúzov detained the greater part of the\narmy at Vílna. Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack\nand physically feeble during his stay in that town. He attended to army\naffairs reluctantly, left everything to his generals, and while awaiting the\nEmperor’s arrival led a dissipated life.\nHaving left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suite—Count\nTolstóy, Prince Volkónski, Arakchéev, and others—the Emperor reached\nVílna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the castle.\nIn spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff officers in full"}, {"page": 1535, "text": "parade uniform stood in front of the castle, as well as a guard of honor of\nthe Semënov regiment.\nA courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka with three\nfoam-flecked horses, shouted “Coming!” and Konovnítsyn rushed into the\nvestibule to inform Kutúzov, who was waiting in the hall porter’s little\nlodge.\nA minute later the old man’s large stout figure in full-dress uniform, his\nchest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach, waddled\nout into the porch.

He carefully and hastily felt himself all over, readjusted his\nhat, and pulling himself together drew himself up and, at the very moment\nwhen the Emperor, having alighted from the sleigh, lifted his eyes to him,\nhanded him the report and began speaking in his smooth, ingratiating voice.\nThe Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kutúzov from head to foot,\nfrowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to the\nold man, extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too,\nowing to a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings, had\nits usual effect on Kutúzov and he gave a sob.\nThe Emperor greeted the officers and the Semënov guard, and again\npressing the old man’s hand went with him into the castle.\nWhen alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his\ndissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made at\nKrásnoe and the Berëzina, and informed him of his intentions for a future\ncampaign abroad.

Kutúzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him.\nSuddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed\nacross his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully he took the object\nthat lay on the salver.

The proprieties\nwere observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example, but\neverybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and good-for-\nnothing. When Kutúzov, conforming to a custom of Catherine’s day,\nordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the Emperor’s\nfeet on his entering the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry face and\nmuttered something in which some people caught the words, “the old\ncomedian.”\nThe Emperor’s displeasure with Kutúzov was specially increased at\nVílna by the fact that Kutúzov evidently could not or would not understand\nthe importance of the coming campaign.\nWhen on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers\nassembled about him: “You have not only saved Russia, you have saved\nEurope!” they all understood that the war was not ended.\nKutúzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that\nno fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia, but\ncould only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had gained. He\ntried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops,\nspoke of the hardships already endured by the people, of the possibility of\nfailure and so forth.\nThis being the field marshal’s frame of mind he was naturally regarded as\nmerely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.\nTo avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural method was\nto do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with Barclay at the\nbeginning of the Russian campaign—to transfer the authority to the"}, {"page": 1538, "text": "Emperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under the commander in\nchief’s feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the change.\nWith this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real strength\nremoved and transferred to the Emperor.

He had\nwhat the doctors termed “bilious fever.” But despite the fact that the doctors\ntreated him, bled him, and gave him medicines to drink, he recovered.\nScarcely any impression was left on Pierre’s mind by all that happened to\nhim from the time of his rescue till his illness. He remembered only the dull\ngray weather now rainy and now snowy, internal physical distress, and\npains in his feet and side. He remembered a general impression of the\nmisfortunes and sufferings of people and of being worried by the curiosity\nof officers and generals who questioned him, he also remembered his\ndifficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses, and above all he\nremembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time. On the day of his\nrescue he had seen the body of Pétya Rostóv. That same day he had learned\nthat Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of Borodinó for more than a\nmonth had recently died in the Rostóvs’ house at Yaroslávl, and Denísov\nwho told him this news also mentioned Hélène’s death, supposing that\nPierre had heard of it long before.

But for a long time in his\ndreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity. In the same way\nlittle by little he came to understand the news he had been told after his\nrescue, about the death of Prince Andrew, the death of his wife, and the\ndestruction of the French.\nA joyous feeling of freedom—that complete inalienable freedom natural\nto man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside Moscow—\nfilled Pierre’s soul during his convalescence. He was surprised to find that\nthis inner freedom, which was independent of external conditions, now had\nas it were an additional setting of external liberty. He was alone in a strange\ntown, without acquaintances. No one demanded anything of him or sent\nhim anywhere. He had all he wanted: the thought of his wife which had\nbeen a continual torment to him was no longer there, since she was no\nmore.\n“Oh, how good! How splendid!” said he to himself when a cleanly laid\ntable was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay down for\nthe night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the French had\ngone and that his wife was no more. “Oh, how good, how splendid!”\nAnd by old habit he asked himself the question: “Well, and what then?\nWhat am I going to do?” And he immediately gave himself the answer:\n“Well, I shall live.

The difference between his former and present self was that\nformerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to him, he\nhad puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to distinguish\nsomething at a distance. At present he still forgot what was said to him and\nstill did not see what was before his eyes, but he now looked with a scarcely\nperceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened\nto what was said, though evidently seeing and hearing something quite\ndifferent. Formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man,\nand so people had been inclined to avoid him. Now a smile at the joy of life\nalways played round his lips, and sympathy for others shone in his eyes\nwith a questioning look as to whether they were as contented as he was, and\npeople felt pleased by his presence.\nPreviously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he talked, and\nseldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew\nhow to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate secrets.\nThe princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly\nhostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after the\nold count’s death, now after staying a short time in Orël—where she had\ncome intending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she considered\nit her duty to nurse him—felt to her surprise and vexation that she had\nbecome fond of him. Pierre did not in any way seek her approval, he merely\nstudied her with interest. Formerly she had felt that he regarded her with\nindifference and irony, and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others\nand had shown him only the combative side of her nature; but now he\nseemed to be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart, and,"}, {"page": 1543, "text": "mistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully, she let him see the hidden,\nkindly sides of her character.\nThe most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more\nsuccessfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth and showing\nsympathy with them. Yet Pierre’s cunning consisted simply in finding\npleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered, hard, and (in\nher own way) proud princess.\n“Yes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence of\nbad people but of people such as myself,” thought she.\nHis servants too—Terénty and Váska—in their own way noticed the\nchange that had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he had become\nmuch “simpler.” Terénty, when he had helped him undress and wished him\ngood night, often lingered with his master’s boots in his hands and clothes\nover his arm, to see whether he would not start a talk. And Pierre, noticing\nthat Terénty wanted a chat, generally kept him there.\n“Well, tell me... now, how did you get food?” he would ask.\nAnd Terénty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of\nthe old count, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and\ntalking, or sometimes listening to Pierre’s stories, and then would go out\ninto the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and affection\nfor him.\nThe doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though he\nconsidered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment\nwas of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with Pierre telling\nhim his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the characters of his\npatients in general, and especially of the ladies.\n“It’s a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is not like our provincials,”\nhe would say.\nThere were several prisoners from the French army in Orël, and the\ndoctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.\nThis officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make fun of\nthe tenderness the Italian expressed for him.\nThe Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk\nwith him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love, and pour out\nto him his indignation against the French and especially against Napoleon."}, {"page": 1544, "text": "“If all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight such a\nnation,” he said to Pierre. “You, who have suffered so from the French, do\nnot even feel animosity toward them.”\nPierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely by\nevoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing.\nDuring the last days of Pierre’s stay in Orël his old Masonic acquaintance\nCount Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge in 1807, came to see\nhim. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress who had a large estate in\nOrël province, and he occupied a temporary post in the commissariat\ndepartment in that town.\nHearing that Bezúkhov was in Orël, Willarski, though they had never\nbeen intimate, came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy\nthat people who meet in a desert generally express for one another.\nWillarski felt dull in Orël and was pleased to meet a man of his own circle\nand, as he supposed, of similar interests.\nBut to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much\nbehind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into apathy\nand egotism.\n“You are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,” he said.\nBut for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been\nformerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To Pierre as he\nlooked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that he had\nbeen like that himself but a short time before.\nWillarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family affairs,\nhis wife’s affairs, and his official duties. He regarded all these occupations\nas hindrances to life, and considered that they were all contemptible\nbecause their aim was the welfare of himself and his family. Military,\nadministrative, political, and Masonic interests continually absorbed his\nattention. And Pierre, without trying to change the other’s views and\nwithout condemning him, but with the quiet, joyful, and amused smile now\nhabitual to him, was interested in this strange though very familiar\nphenomenon.\nThere was a new feature in Pierre’s relations with Willarski, with the\nprincess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which gained\nfor him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of the"}, {"page": 1545, "text": "impossibility of changing a man’s convictions by words, and his recognition\nof the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing things each from\nhis own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of each individual which\nused to excite and irritate Pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt\nfor, and the interest he took in, other people. The difference, and sometimes\ncomplete contradiction, between men’s opinions and their lives, and\nbetween one man and another, pleased him and drew from him an amused\nand gentle smile.\nIn practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of\ngravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary questions,\nespecially requests for money to which, as an extremely wealthy man, he\nwas very exposed, produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and\nperplexity. “To give or not to give?” he had asked himself. “I have it and he\nneeds it. But someone else needs it still more. Who needs it most? And\nperhaps they are both impostors?” In the old days he had been unable to\nfind a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who asked as long\nas he had anything to give. Formerly he had been in a similar state of\nperplexity with regard to every question concerning his property, when one\nperson advised one thing and another something else.\nNow to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or\nperplexity about these questions. There was now within him a judge who by\nsome rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done.\nHe was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he felt\ncertain of what ought and what ought not to be done. The first time he had\nrecourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner, a colonel, came to\nhim and, after talking a great deal about his exploits, concluded by making\nwhat amounted to a demand that Pierre should give him four thousand\nfrancs to send to his wife and children. Pierre refused without the least\ndifficulty or effort, and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had\nbeen what used to appear so insurmountably difficult. At the same time that\nhe refused the colonel’s demand he made up his mind that he must have\nrecourse to artifice when leaving Orël, to induce the Italian officer to accept\nsome money of which he was evidently in need. A further proof to Pierre of\nhis own more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his\ndecision with regard to his wife’s debts and to the rebuilding of his houses\nin and near Moscow."}, {"page": 1546, "text": "His head steward came to him at Orël and Pierre reckoned up with him\nhis diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according to\nthe head steward’s calculation, about two million rubles.\nTo console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate\nshowing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but\nwould even be increased if he refused to pay his wife’s debts which he was\nunder no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild his Moscow house and the\ncountry house on his Moscow estate, which had cost him eighty thousand\nrubles a year and brought in nothing.\n“Yes, of course that’s true,” said Pierre with a cheerful smile. “I don’t\nneed all that at all. By being ruined I have become much richer.”\nBut in January Savélich came from Moscow and gave him an account of\nthe state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect had made of\nthe cost of rebuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this as of a\nsettled matter. About the same time he received letters from Prince Vasíli\nand other Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife’s debts. And Pierre\ndecided that the steward’s proposals which had so pleased him were wrong\nand that he must go to Petersburg and settle his wife’s affairs and must\nrebuild in Moscow. Why this was necessary he did not know, but he knew\nfor certain that it was necessary. His income would be reduced by three\nfourths, but he felt it must be done.\nWillarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.\nDuring the whole time of his convalescence in Orël Pierre had\nexperienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his journey\nhe found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new faces, that\nfeeling was intensified. Throughout his journey he felt like a schoolboy on\nholiday. Everyone—the stagecoach driver, the post-house overseers, the\npeasants on the roads and in the villages—had a new significance for him.\nThe presence and remarks of Willarski who continually deplored the\nignorance and poverty of Russia and its backwardness compared with\nEurope only heightened Pierre’s pleasure. Where Willarski saw deadness\nPierre saw an extraordinary strength and vitality—the strength which in that\nvast space amid the snows maintained the life of this original, peculiar, and\nunique people. He did not contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree\nwith him—an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid"}, {"page": 1547, "text": "discussions that could lead to nothing—and he smiled joyfully as he\nlistened to him."}, {"page": 1548, "text": "CHAPTER XIV\nIt would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has\nbeen destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits of rubbish,\nlarvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they jostle, overtake\none another, and fight, and it would be equally difficult to explain what\ncaused the Russians after the departure of the French to throng to the place\nthat had formerly been Moscow. But when we watch the ants round their\nruined heap, the tenacity, energy, and immense number of the delving\ninsects prove that despite the destruction of the heap, something\nindestructible, which though intangible is the real strength of the colony,\nstill exists; and similarly, though in Moscow in the month of October there\nwas no government and no churches, shrines, riches, or houses—it was still\nthe Moscow it had been in August. All was destroyed, except something\nintangible yet powerful and indestructible.\nThe motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after it had\nbeen cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and at first for\nthe most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all had in common: a\ndesire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, to apply their\nactivities there.\nWithin a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in a\nfortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on.

These forms were\nlifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, warehouses, market\nstalls, granaries—for the most part still stocked with goods—and there were\nfactories and workshops, palaces and wealthy houses filled with luxuries,\nhospitals, prisons, government offices, churches, and cathedrals. The longer\nthe French remained the more these forms of town life perished, until\nfinally all was merged into one confused, lifeless scene of plunder.\nThe more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the\nwealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But\nplundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city began,\nhad an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater the number of\npeople taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth of the city and its\nregular life restored.\nBesides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by curiosity,\nsome by official duties, some by self-interest—house owners, clergy,\nofficials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and peasants—streamed into\nMoscow as blood flows to the heart.\nWithin a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off\nplunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses out of\nthe town.

He called on Count Rostopchín and\non some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, and he intended to leave\nfor Petersburg two days later. Everybody was celebrating the victory,\neverything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city. Everyone\nwas pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished to meet him, and everyone\nquestioned him about what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly well\ndisposed toward them all, but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of\nbinding himself in any way. To all questions put to him—whether important\nor quite trifling—such as: Where would he live? Was he going to rebuild?\nWhen was he going to Petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel for\nsomeone?—he replied: “Yes, perhaps,” or, “I think so,” and so on.\nHe had heard that the Rostóvs were at Kostromá but the thought of\nNatásha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant memory\nof the distant past. He felt himself not only free from social obligations but\nalso from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had aroused in himself.\nOn the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetskóys that\nPrincess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days of\nPrince Andrew had often occupied Pierre’s thoughts and now recurred to\nhim with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary was in\nMoscow and living in her house—which had not been burned—in\nVozdvízhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her.\nOn his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their\nfriendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last one\nat Borodinó.\n“Is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in? Is it\npossible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?”\nthought Pierre. He recalled Karatáev and his death and involuntarily began"}, {"page": 1552, "text": "to compare these two men, so different, and yet so similar in that they had\nboth lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them.\nPierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood.\nThe house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but its general\naspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with a stern face\nas if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of the old prince had\nnot disturbed the order of things in the house, informed him that the\nprincess had gone to her own apartments, and that she received on Sundays.\n“Announce me. Perhaps she will see me,” said Pierre.\n“Yes, sir,” said the man. “Please step into the portrait gallery.”\nA few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought\nword from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he would\nexcuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.\nIn a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her\nanother person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess always\nhad lady companions, but who they were and what they were like he never\nknew or remembered. “This must be one of her companions,” he thought,\nglancing at the lady in the black dress.\nThe princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.\n“Yes,” she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her hand,\n“so this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the very last,” she\nwent on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a shyness that\nsurprised him for an instant.\n“I was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good news\nwe had received for a long time.”\nAgain the princess glanced round at her companion with even more\nuneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre\ninterrupted her.\n“Just imagine—I knew nothing about him!” said he. “I thought he had\nbeen killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only know that\nhe fell in with the Rostóvs.... What a strange coincidence!”\nPierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the\ncompanion’s face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and, as\noften happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion in the"}, {"page": 1553, "text": "black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not hinder his\nconversing freely with Princess Mary.\nBut when he mentioned the Rostóvs, Princess Mary’s face expressed still\ngreater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierre’s face to that\nof the lady in the black dress and said:\n“Do you really not recognize her?”\nPierre looked again at the companion’s pale, delicate face with its black\neyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long forgotten and\nmore than sweet, looked at him from those attentive eyes.\n“But no, it can’t be!” he thought. “This stern, thin, pale face that looks so\nmuch older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her.” But at that\nmoment Princess Mary said, “Natásha!” And with difficulty, effort, and\nstress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges, a smile\nappeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from that opening door\ncame a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with a happiness he had\nlong forgotten and of which he had not even been thinking—especially at\nthat moment. It suffused him, seized him, and enveloped him completely.\nWhen she smiled doubt was no longer possible, it was Natásha and he loved\nher.\nAt that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess Mary,\nand above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had been unaware. He\nflushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He tried to hide his agitation. But\nthe more he tried to hide it the more clearly—clearer than any words could\nhave done—did he betray to himself, to her, and to Princess Mary that he\nloved her.\n“No, it’s only the unexpectedness of it,” thought Pierre. But as soon as he\ntried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Mary he\nagain glanced at Natásha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and a\nstill-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul. He became\nconfused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was saying.\nPierre had failed to notice Natásha because he did not at all expect to see\nher there, but he had failed to recognize her because the change in her since\nhe last saw her was immense.

They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness\nwhich usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is impossible to\ngo back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is awkward, and yet the\ndesire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation. They went\nsilently to table.

We were not an exemplary couple,” he added\nquickly, glancing at Natásha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he\nwould speak of his wife, “but her death shocked me terribly.

When he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold,\nstern, and he fancied even contemptuous.\n“And did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been told?”\nsaid Princess Mary.\nPierre laughed.\n“No, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner\nmeans being Napoleon’s guest. Not only did I never see him but I heard\nnothing about him—I was in much lower company!”\nSupper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his\ncaptivity was gradually led on to do so.\n“But it’s true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?” Natásha\nasked with a slight smile. “I guessed it then when we met at the Súkharev\ntower, do you remember?”"}, {"page": 1560, "text": "Pierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually led by\nPrincess Mary’s questions and especially by Natásha’s into giving a detailed\naccount of his adventures.\nAt first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with\nhim toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he came to\ndescribe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was unconsciously\ncarried away and began speaking with the suppressed emotion of a man re-\nexperiencing in recollection strong impressions he has lived through.\nPrincess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at\nNatásha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his goodness.\nNatásha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face constantly\nchanging with the narrative, watched Pierre with an attention that never\nwandered—evidently herself experiencing all that he described. Not only\nher look, but her exclamations and the brief questions she put, showed\nPierre that she understood just what he wished to convey. It was clear that\nshe understood not only what he said but also what he wished to, but could\nnot, express in words. The account Pierre gave of the incident with the child\nand the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was this: “It was an\nawful sight—children abandoned, some in the flames... One was snatched\nout before my eyes... and there were women who had their things snatched\noff and their earrings torn out...” he flushed and grew confused. “Then a\npatrol arrived and all the men—all those who were not looting, that is—\nwere arrested, and I among them.”\n“I am sure you’re not telling us everything; I am sure you did\nsomething...” said Natásha and pausing added, “something fine?”\nPierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over\nthe horrible details, but Natásha insisted that he should not omit anything.\nPierre began to tell about Karatáev, but paused. By this time he had risen\nfrom the table and was pacing the room, Natásha following him with her\neyes. Then he added:\n“No, you can’t understand what I learned from that illiterate man—that\nsimple fellow.”\n“Yes, yes, go on!” said Natásha. “Where is he?”\n“They killed him almost before my eyes.”"}, {"page": 1561, "text": "And Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of the last\ndays of their retreat, of Karatáev’s illness and his death.\nHe told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now, as it\nwere, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that he was\ntelling it all to Natásha he experienced that pleasure which a man has when\nwomen listen to him—not clever women who when listening either try to\nremember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity offers\nto retell it, or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own and\npromptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their little\nmental workshop—but the pleasure given by real women gifted with a\ncapacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself. Natásha\nwithout knowing it was all attention: she did not lose a word, no single\nquiver in Pierre’s voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in his face, nor a\nsingle gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its flight and took it\nstraight into her open heart, divining the secret meaning of all Pierre’s\nmental travail.\nPrincess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she\nnow saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the\npossibility of love and happiness between Natásha and Pierre, and the first\nthought of this filled her heart with gladness.\nIt was three o’clock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad and\nstern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them.\nPierre finished his story. Natásha continued to look at him intently with\nbright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to understand something\nmore which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in shamefaced and happy\nconfusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to think what to say next to\nintroduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary was silent. It occurred to none of\nthem that it was three o’clock and time to go to bed.\n“People speak of misfortunes and sufferings,” remarked Pierre, “but if at\nthis moment I were asked: ‘Would you rather be what you were before you\nwere taken prisoner, or go through all this again?’ then for heaven’s sake let\nme again have captivity and horseflesh! We imagine that when we are\nthrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is only then that what is new\nand good begins. While there is life there is happiness. There is much, much\nbefore us. I say this to you,” he added, turning to Natásha."}, {"page": 1562, "text": "“Yes, yes,” she said, answering something quite different. “I too should\nwish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning.”\nPierre looked intently at her.\n“Yes, and nothing more,” said Natásha.\n“It’s not true, not true!” cried Pierre. “I am not to blame for being alive\nand wishing to live—nor you either.”\nSuddenly Natásha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and\nbegan to cry.\n“What is it, Natásha?” said Princess Mary.\n“Nothing, nothing.” She smiled at Pierre through her tears. “Good night!\nIt is time for bed.”\nPierre rose and took his leave.\nPrincess Mary and Natásha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of\nwhat Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of\nPierre nor did Natásha speak of him.\n“Well, good night, Mary!” said Natásha. “Do you know, I am often afraid\nthat by not speaking of him” (she meant Prince Andrew) “for fear of not\ndoing justice to our feelings, we forget him.”\nPrincess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of\nNatásha’s remark, but she did not express agreement in words.\n“Is it possible to forget?” said she.\n“It did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and painful,\nbut good, very good!” said Natásha. “I am sure he really loved him. That is\nwhy I told him... Was it all right?” she added, suddenly blushing.\n“To tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!” said Princess Mary.\n“Do you know, Mary...” Natásha suddenly said with a mischievous smile\nsuch as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, “he has\nsomehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh—as if he had just come out of\na Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. Isn’t it true?”\n“Yes,” replied Princess Mary. “He has greatly improved.”\n“With a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he had\ncome straight from the bath... Papa used to...”"}, {"page": 1563, "text": "“I understand why he” (Prince Andrew) “liked no one so much as him,”\nsaid Princess Mary.\n“Yes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when they\nare quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike him—in\neverything.”\n“Yes, but he’s wonderful.”\n“Well, good night,” said Natásha.\nAnd the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as if\nit had been forgotten there."}, {"page": 1564, "text": "CHAPTER XVIII\nIt was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He paced up\nand down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and\nfrowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, and now\nsmiling happily.\nHe was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Natásha, and of their love, at one\nmoment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that feeling. It was\nalready six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room.\n“Well, what’s to be done if it cannot be avoided? What’s to be done?\nEvidently it has to be so,” said he to himself, and hastily undressing he got\ninto bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision.\n“Strange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything\nthat she and I may be man and wife,” he told himself.\nA few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the\nFriday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Savélich came to ask him about\npacking for the journey.\n“What, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?”\nhe asked involuntarily, though only to himself. “Oh, yes, long ago before\nthis happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg,” he reflected.\n“Why? But perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is and how attentive,\nand how he remembers everything,” he thought, looking at Savélich’s old\nface, “and what a pleasant smile he has!”\n“Well, Savélich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?” Pierre\nasked him.\n“What’s the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under the\nlate count—the kingdom of heaven be his!—and we have lived under you\ntoo, without ever being wronged.”\n“And your children?”"}, {"page": 1565, "text": "“The children will live just the same. With such masters one can live.”\n“But what about my heirs?” said Pierre. “Supposing I suddenly marry... it\nmight happen,” he added with an involuntary smile.\n“If I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good thing.”\n“How easy he thinks it,” thought Pierre. “He doesn’t know how terrible it\nis and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrible!”\n“So what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?” asked Savélich.\n“No, I’ll put it off for a bit. I’ll tell you later. You must forgive the trouble\nI have put you to,” said Pierre, and seeing Savélich smile, he thought: “But\nhow strange it is that he should not know that now there is no Petersburg for\nme, and that that must be settled first of all! But probably he knows it well\nenough and is only pretending. Shall I have a talk with him and see what he\nthinks?” Pierre reflected. “No, another time.”\nAt breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had been to see\nPrincess Mary the day before and had there met—“Whom do you think?\nNatásha Rostóva!”\nThe princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he\nhad seen Anna Semënovna.\n“Do you know her?” asked Pierre.\n“I have seen the princess,” she replied. “I heard that they were arranging\na match for her with young Rostóv. It would be a very good thing for the\nRostóvs, they are said to be utterly ruined.”\n“No; I mean do you know Natásha Rostóva?”\n“I heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great pity.”\n“No, she either doesn’t understand or is pretending,” thought Pierre.\n“Better not say anything to her either.”\nThe princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre’s journey.\n“How kind they all are,” thought Pierre. “What is surprising is that they\nshould trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of interest\nto them. And all for me!”\nOn the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send\na representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be\nreturned to their owners that day."}, {"page": 1566, "text": "“And this man too,” thought Pierre, looking into the face of the Chief of\nPolice. “What a fine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy bothering\nabout such trifles now! And they actually say he is not honest and takes\nbribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn’t he take bribes? That’s the\nway he was brought up, and everybody does it. But what a kind, pleasant\nface and how he smiles as he looks at me.”\nPierre went to Princess Mary’s to dinner.\nAs he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned\ndown, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness of\nthe chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters of the\ntown, stretching out and concealing one another, reminded him of the Rhine\nand the Colosseum. The cabmen he met and their passengers, the carpenters\ncutting the timber for new houses with axes, the women hawkers, and the\nshopkeepers, all looked at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to\nsay: “Ah, there he is! Let’s see what will come of it!”\nAt the entrance to Princess Mary’s house Pierre felt doubtful whether he\nhad really been there the night before and really seen Natásha and talked to\nher. “Perhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find no one there.” But\nhe had hardly entered the room before he felt her presence with his whole\nbeing by the loss of his sense of freedom. She was in the same black dress\nwith soft folds and her hair was done the same way as the day before, yet\nshe was quite different. Had she been like this when he entered the day\nbefore he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her.\nShe was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince\nAndrew’s fiancée. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on her\nface was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.\nPierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there,\nbut Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her.\nNext day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening. Though\nPrincess Mary and Natásha were evidently glad to see their visitor and\nthough all Pierre’s interest was now centered in that house, by the evening\nthey had talked over everything and the conversation passed from one\ntrivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long that\nPrincess Mary and Natásha exchanged glances, evidently wondering when\nhe would go. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy and"}, {"page": 1567, "text": "embarrassed, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take his\nleave.\nPrincess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining of a\nheadache began to say good night.\n“So you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?” she asked.\n“No, I am not going,” Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone and as\nthough offended. “Yes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrow—but I won’t say\ngood-by yet. I will call round in case you have any commissions for me,”\nsaid he, standing before Princess Mary and turning red, but not taking his\ndeparture.\nNatásha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other\nhand instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly and\nintently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she had plainly\nshown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and long-drawn sigh\nshe seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.\nWhen Natásha left the room Pierre’s confusion and awkwardness\nimmediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly\nmoved an armchair toward Princess Mary.\n“Yes, I wanted to tell you,” said he, answering her look as if she had\nspoken. “Princess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my\ndear friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of her, I know it’s\nimpossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a brother to her. No, not that,\nI don’t, I can’t...”\nHe paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands.\n“Well,” he went on with an evident effort at self-control and coherence.\n“I don’t know when I began to love her, but I have loved her and her alone\nall my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life without her. I cannot\npropose to her at present, but the thought that perhaps she might someday\nbe my wife and that I may be missing that possibility... that possibility... is\nterrible. Tell me, can I hope? Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!” he\nadded after a pause, and touched her hand as she did not reply.\n“I am thinking of what you have told me,” answered Princess Mary.\n“This is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at\npresent...”"}, {"page": 1568, "text": "Princess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was\nimpossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in\nNatásha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre spoke\nof his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for.\n“To speak to her now wouldn’t do,” said the princess all the same.\n“But what am I to do?”\n“Leave it to me,” said Princess Mary. “I know...”\nPierre was looking into Princess Mary’s eyes.\n“Well?... Well?...” he said.\n“I know that she loves... will love you,” Princess Mary corrected herself.\nBefore her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened\nexpression seized Princess Mary’s hand.\n“What makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?”\n“Yes, I think so,” said Princess Mary with a smile. “Write to her parents,\nand leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it to happen and my\nheart tells me it will.”\n“No, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can’t be.... How happy I am!\nNo, it can’t be!” Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary’s hands.\n“Go to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,” she said.\n“To Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I’ll go. But I may come again\ntomorrow?”\nNext day Pierre came to say good-by. Natásha was less animated than she\nhad been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre sometimes\nfelt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer,\nthat nothing existed but happiness. “Is it possible? No, it can’t be,” he told\nhimself at every look, gesture, and word that filled his soul with joy.\nWhen on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could not\nhelp holding it a little longer in his own.\n“Is it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this treasure of\nfeminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that it will one day be\nmine forever, as familiar to me as I am to myself?... No, that’s\nimpossible!...”\n“Good-by, Count,” she said aloud. “I shall look forward very much to\nyour return,” she added in a whisper."}, {"page": 1569, "text": "And these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face which\naccompanied them, formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible\nmemories, interpretations, and happy meditations for Pierre. “‘I shall look\nforward very much to your return....’ Yes, yes, how did she say it? Yes, ‘I\nshall look forward very much to your return.’ Oh, how happy I am! What is\nhappening to me? How happy I am!” said Pierre to himself."}, {"page": 1570, "text": "CHAPTER XIX\nThere was nothing in Pierre’s soul now at all like what had troubled it\nduring his courtship of Hélène.\nHe did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words\nhe had spoken, or say: “Oh, why did I not say that?” and, “Whatever made\nme say ‘Je vous aime’?” On the contrary, he now repeated in imagination\nevery word that he or Natásha had spoken and pictured every detail of her\nface and smile, and did not wish to diminish or add anything, but only to\nrepeat it again and again. There was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind\nas to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong. Only one terrible\ndoubt sometimes crossed his mind: “Wasn’t it all a dream? Isn’t Princess\nMary mistaken? Am I not too conceited and self-confident? I believe all this\n—and suddenly Princess Mary will tell her, and she will be sure to smile\nand say: ‘How strange! He must be deluding himself. Doesn’t he know that\nhe is a man, just a man, while I...? I am something altogether different and\nhigher.’”\nThat was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now make any\nplans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only he\ncould attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended with that.\nA joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself incapable,\npossessed him. The whole meaning of life—not for him alone but for the\nwhole world—seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of\nbeing loved by her.

Sometimes it seemed to him that\nother people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide\nthat pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests. In every word\nand gesture he saw allusions to his happiness.

The storm-tossed sea of European history had\nsubsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the\nmysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of their\nmotion are unknown to us) continued to operate.\nThough the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the\nmovement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time. Various\ngroups of people formed and dissolved, the coming formation and\ndissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of\npreparation.\nThe sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as\npreviously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures were not borne by\nthe waves from one shore to another as before. They now seemed to rotate\non one spot. The historical figures at the head of armies, who formerly\nreflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars, campaigns, and\nbattles, now reflected the restless movement by political and diplomatic\ncombinations, laws, and treaties.\nThe historians call this activity of the historical figures “the reaction.”\nIn dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical\npersonages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the reaction.\nAll the well-known people of that period, from Alexander and Napoleon to\nMadame de Staël, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and the rest,\npass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or condemned\naccording to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction.\nAccording to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in Russia\nalso, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who according to\nthem was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement of\nhis reign, being the savior of Russia.\nThere is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist to\nlearned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander for things"}, {"page": 1577, "text": "he did wrong at this period of his reign.\n“He ought to have acted in this way and in that way. In this case he did\nwell and in that case badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning of his\nreign and during 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution to Poland,\nforming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power to Arakchéev, favoring\nGolítsyn and mysticism, and afterwards Shishkóv and Photius. He also\nacted badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the\nSemënov regiment.”\nIt would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians\naddress to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity.\nWhat do these reproaches mean?\nDo not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander I (the\nliberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with Napoleon,\nthe firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813) flow from the\nsame sources—the circumstances of his birth, education, and life—that\nmade his personality what it was and from which the actions for which they\nblame him (the Holy Alliance, the restoration of Poland, and the reaction of\n1820 and later) also flowed?\nIn what does the substance of those reproaches lie?\nIt lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I, standing on\nthe highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of\nhistory focused upon him; a character exposed to those strongest of all\ninfluences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception inseparable from\npower; a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility for\nall that was happening in Europe; and not a fictitious but a live character\nwho like every man had his personal habits, passions, and impulses toward\ngoodness, beauty, and truth—that this character—though not lacking in\nvirtue (the historians do not accuse him of that)—had not the same\nconception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a present-day\nprofessor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with learning:\nthat is, with books and lectures and with taking notes from them.\nBut even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was mistaken in\nhis view of what was good for the people, we must inevitably assume that\nthe historian who judges Alexander will also after the lapse of some time\nturn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity.

The\ncommencement of that movement was the movement from west to east. For\nthe peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to\nMoscow it was necessary: (1) that they should form themselves into a\nmilitary group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike military\ngroup of the east, (2) that they should abandon all established traditions and\ncustoms, and (3) that during their military movement they should have at\ntheir head a man who could justify to himself and to them the deceptions,\nrobberies, and murders which would have to be committed during that\nmovement.\nAnd beginning with the French Revolution the old inadequately large\ngroup was destroyed, as well as the old habits and traditions, and step by\nstep a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and\ntraditions, and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the\ncoming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done.\nA man without convictions, without habits, without traditions, without a\nname, and not even a Frenchman, emerges—by what seem the strangest\nchances—from among all the seething French parties, and without joining\nany one of them is borne forward to a prominent position.\nThe ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance of his\nopponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling and self-\nconfident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army. The\nbrilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to Italy, his opponents’\nreluctance to fight, and his own childish audacity and self-confidence\nsecure him military fame.

And by chance an escape from this dangerous position presents\nitself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition to Africa. Again so-\ncalled chance accompanies him. Impregnable Malta surrenders without a\nshot; his most reckless schemes are crowned with success. The enemy’s\nfleet, which subsequently did not let a single boat pass, allows his entire\narmy to elude it. In Africa a whole series of outrages are committed against\nthe almost unarmed inhabitants.

Chance forms the characters of\nthe rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms the character of Paul\nI of Russia who recognizes his government; chance contrives a plot against\nhim which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power. Chance puts\nthe Duc d’Enghien in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him—\nthereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had\nthe right, since he had the might. Chance contrives that though he directs all\nhis efforts to prepare an expedition against England (which would\ninevitably have ruined him) he never carries out that intention, but\nunexpectedly falls upon Mack and the Austrians, who surrender without a\nbattle. Chance and genius give him the victory at Austerlitz; and by chance\nall men, not only the French but all Europe—except England which does\nnot take part in the events about to happen—despite their former horror and\ndetestation of his crimes, now recognize his authority, the title he has given\nhimself, and his ideal of grandeur and glory, which seems excellent and\nreasonable to them all.\nAs if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement, the\nwestern forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806, 1807, and\n1809, gaining strength and growing.

He\nseemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these events, and\nbowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and inviting further\nblows which would finish him. He seemed now frightened and distraught\nand now unnaturally animated and enterprising.\nThe arrangements for Natásha’s marriage occupied him for a while.

The state of the count’s affairs became quite obvious a month after\nhis death, surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts the\nexistence of which no one had suspected.

As always\nhappens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get paid first,\nand those who like Mítenka held promissory notes given them as presents\nnow became the most exacting of the creditors.

And when she asked herself\nwhat distressed her, she had to admit that it was her relation to Rostóv. His\ncold, polite manner did not express his feeling for her (she knew that) but it\nconcealed something, and until she could discover what that something\nwas, she felt that she could not be at ease.\nOne day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her\nnephew’s lessons, she was informed that Rostóv had called. With a firm\nresolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent for\nMademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.\nHer first glance at Nicholas’ face told her that he had only come to fulfill\nthe demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain the tone in\nwhich he addressed her.\nThey spoke of the countess’ health, of their mutual friends, of the latest\nwar news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety had elapsed after\nwhich a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to say good-by.\nWith Mademoiselle Bourienne’s help the princess had maintained the\nconversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he rose, she\nwas so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and her mind was so full\nof the question why she alone was granted so little happiness in life, that in\na fit of absent-mindedness she sat still, her luminous eyes gazing fixedly\nbefore her, not noticing that he had risen.\nNicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her\nabstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then again\nlooked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of suffering on\nher gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was vaguely conscious\nthat he might be the cause of the sadness her face expressed. He wished to\nhelp her and say something pleasant, but could think of nothing to say.\n“Good-by, Princess!” said he.\nShe started, flushed, and sighed deeply.\n“Oh, I beg your pardon,” she said as if waking up. “Are you going\nalready, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the countess!”\n“Wait a moment, I’ll fetch it,” said Mademoiselle Bourienne, and she left\nthe room.\nThey both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another."}, {"page": 1596, "text": "“Yes, Princess,” said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, “it doesn’t seem\nlong ago since we first met at Boguchárovo, but how much water has\nflowed since then! In what distress we all seemed to be then, yet I would\ngive much to bring back that time... but there’s no bringing it back.”\nPrincess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones\nas he said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of his\nwords which would explain his feeling for her.\n“Yes, yes,” said she, “but you have no reason to regret the past, Count. As\nI understand your present life, I think you will always recall it with\nsatisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills it now...”\n“I cannot accept your praise,” he interrupted her hurriedly. “On the\ncontrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at all an interesting\nor cheerful subject.”\nHis face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression. But the\nprincess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved, and it\nwas to him that she now spoke.\n“I thought you would allow me to tell you this,” she said. “I had come so\nnear to you... and to all your family that I thought you would not consider\nmy sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken,” and suddenly her voice\ntrembled. “I don’t know why,” she continued, recovering herself, “but you\nused to be different, and...”\n“There are a thousand reasons why,” laying special emphasis on the why.\n“Thank you, Princess,” he added softly. “Sometimes it is hard.”\n“So that’s why! That’s why!” a voice whispered in Princess Mary’s soul.\n“No, it was not only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only that handsome\nexterior, that I loved in him. I divined his noble, resolute, self-sacrificing\nspirit too,” she said to herself. “Yes, he is poor now and I am rich.... Yes,\nthat’s the only reason....

Nicholas was a plain\nfarmer: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones then coming\ninto vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate management,\ndisliked factories, the raising of expensive products, and the buying of\nexpensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the\nwork on his estate. He always had before his mind’s eye the estate as a\nwhole and not any particular part of it. The chief thing in his eyes was not\nthe nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen in the air, nor manures, nor special\nplows, but that most important agent by which nitrogen, oxygen, manure,\nand plow were made effective—the peasant laborer. When Nicholas first\nbegan farming and began to understand its different branches, it was the\nserf who especially attracted his attention. The peasant seemed to him not\nmerely a tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself. At first he\nwatched the serfs, trying to understand their aims and what they considered\ngood and bad, and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in\nreality learning from them their methods, their manner of speech, and their\njudgment of what was good and bad. Only when he had understood the\npeasants’ tastes and aspirations, had learned to talk their language, to grasp\nthe hidden meaning of their words, and felt akin to them did he begin boldly"}, {"page": 1599, "text": "to manage his serfs, that is, to perform toward them the duties demanded of\nhim. And Nicholas’ management produced very brilliant results.\nGuided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management of the\nestates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and\ndelegate, the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they\nhad the right to choose, and these posts never changed hands. Before\nanalyzing the properties of manure, before entering into the debit and credit\n(as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle the peasants had\nand increased the number by all possible means. He kept the peasant\nfamilies together in the largest groups possible, not allowing the family\ngroups to divide into separate households. He was hard alike on the lazy,\nthe depraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled from the\ncommune.\nHe was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants’ hay and\ncorn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested\nso early and so well, or got so good a return, as did Nicholas.\nHe disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs—the “drones”\nas he called them—and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity. When a\ndecision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf, especially if one had to\nbe punished, he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in the\nhouse; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead\nof a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He never felt any\nhesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that his every decision\nwould be approved by them all with very few exceptions.\nHe did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to make\nthings easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt inclined to do so.\nHe could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or\nshould not do, but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own mind.\nOften, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he would\nsay: “What can one do with our Russian peasants?” and imagined that he\ncould not bear them.\nYet he loved “our Russian peasants” and their way of life with his whole\nsoul, and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one way\nand manner of farming which produced good results.\nCountess Mary was jealous of this passion of her husband’s and regretted\nthat she could not share it; but she could not understand the joys and"}, {"page": 1600, "text": "vexations he derived from that world, to her so remote and alien. She could\nnot understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when, after\ngetting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the fields or on\nthe threshing floor, he returned from the sowing or mowing or reaping to\nhave tea with her. She did not understand why he spoke with such\nadmiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and well-to-do peasant\nMatthew Ermíshin, who with his family had carted corn all night; or of the\nfact that his (Nicholas’) sheaves were already stacked before anyone else\nhad his harvest in. She did not understand why he stepped out from the\nwindow to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so\njoyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots\nof the young oats, or why when the wind carried away a threatening cloud\nduring the hay harvest he would return from the barn, flushed, sunburned,\nand perspiring, with a smell of wormwood and gentian in his hair and,\ngleefully rubbing his hands, would say: “Well, one more day and my grain\nand the peasants’ will all be under cover.”\nStill less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready to\nanticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she brought\nhim a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her\nto be excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should obstinately\nrefuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her business.\nShe felt he had a world apart, which he loved passionately and which had\nlaws she had not fathomed.\nSometimes when, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work\nhe was doing for his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: “Not in the least; it\nnever entered my head and I wouldn’t do that for their good! That’s all\npoetry and old wives’ talk—all that doing good to one’s neighbor! What I\nwant is that our children should not have to go begging. I must put our\naffairs in order while I am alive, that’s all. And to do that, order and\nstrictness are essential.... That’s all about it!” said he, clenching his vigorous\nfist. “And fairness, of course,” he added, “for if the peasant is naked and\nhungry and has only one miserable horse, he can do no good either for\nhimself or for me.”\nAnd all Nicholas did was fruitful—probably just because he refused to\nallow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtue’s sake.\nHis means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring estates came to beg"}, {"page": 1601, "text": "him to buy them, and long after his death the memory of his administration\nwas devoutly preserved among the serfs. “He was a master... the peasants’\naffairs first and then his own.

At first he saw nothing reprehensible in this, but in the\nsecond year of his marriage his view of that form of punishment suddenly\nchanged.\nOnce in summer he had sent for the village elder from Boguchárovo, a\nman who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused\nof dishonesty and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the porch to\nquestion him, and immediately after the elder had given a few replies the\nsound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch Nicholas went\nup to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame,\nand as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that morning. Among\nother things he spoke of the Boguchárovo elder. Countess Mary turned red\nand then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed\nand gave her husband no reply.\n“Such an insolent scoundrel!” he cried, growing hot again at the mere\nrecollection of him. “If he had told me he was drunk and did not see... But\nwhat is the matter with you, Mary?” he suddenly asked.\nCountess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily looked\ndown again and her lips puckered.\n“Why, whatever is the matter, my dearest?”\nThe looks of the plain Countess Mary always improved when she was in\ntears. She never cried from pain or vexation, but always from sorrow or\npity, and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm.\nThe moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself\nand began to cry.\n“Nicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!” and\nshe covered her face with her hands."}, {"page": 1603, "text": "Nicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, and paced up\nand down the room. He understood what she was weeping about, but could\nnot in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded from\nchildhood as quite an everyday event was wrong. “Is it just sentimentality,\nold wives’ tales, or is she right?” he asked himself. Before he had solved\nthat point he glanced again at her face filled with love and pain, and he\nsuddenly realized that she was right and that he had long been sinning\nagainst himself.\n“Mary,” he said softly, going up to her, “it will never happen again; I give\nyou my word. Never,” he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy asking for\nforgiveness.\nThe tears flowed faster still from the countess’ eyes. She took his hand\nand kissed it.\n“Nicholas, when did you break your cameo?” she asked to change the\nsubject, looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of\nLaocoön’s head.\n“Today—it was the same affair. Oh, Mary, don’t remind me of it!” and\nagain he flushed. “I give you my word of honor it shan’t occur again, and\nlet this always be a reminder to me,” and he pointed to the broken ring.\nAfter that, when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the\nblood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench, Nicholas would turn\nthe broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the man who\nwas making him angry. But he did forget himself once or twice within a\ntwelvemonth, and then he would go and confess to his wife, and would\nagain promise that this should really be the very last time.\n“Mary, you must despise me!” he would say. “I deserve it.”\n“You should go, go away at once, if you don’t feel strong enough to\ncontrol yourself,” she would reply sadly, trying to comfort her husband.\nAmong the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked.\nHe did not concern himself with the interests of his own class, and\nconsequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid. The\nwhole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with the work\non his farm. In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same\nbusiness-like seriousness—leaving home for a month, or even two, with his\nhunt. In winter he visited his other villages or spent his time reading. The"}, {"page": 1604, "text": "books he read were chiefly historical, and on these he spent a certain sum\nevery year. He was collecting, as he said, a serious library, and he made it a\nrule to read through all the books he bought. He would sit in his study with\na grave air, reading—a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty, but\nwhich afterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure\nand a consciousness of being occupied with serious matters. In winter,\nexcept for business excursions, he spent most of his time at home making\nhimself one with his family and entering into all the details of his children’s\nrelations with their mother. The harmony between him and his wife grew\ncloser and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her.\nFrom the time of his marriage Sónya had lived in his house. Before that,\nNicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and Sónya,\nblaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess Mary to be\ngentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized the wrong he had\ndone Sónya, felt herself to blame toward her, and imagined that her wealth\nhad influenced Nicholas’ choice. She could not find fault with Sónya in any\nway and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill-will toward her which she\ncould not overcome.\nOnce she had a talk with her friend Natásha about Sónya and about her\nown injustice toward her.\n“You know,” said Natásha, “you have read the Gospels a great deal—\nthere is a passage in them that just fits Sónya.”\n“What?” asked Countess Mary, surprised.\n“‘To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be\ntaken away.’ You remember? She is one that hath not; why, I don’t know.\nPerhaps she lacks egotism, I don’t know, but from her is taken away, and\neverything has been taken away. Sometimes I am dreadfully sorry for her.\nFormerly I very much wanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always had a sort\nof presentiment that it would not come off. She is a sterile flower, you know\n—like some strawberry blossoms. Sometimes I am sorry for her, and\nsometimes I think she doesn’t feel it as you or I would.”\nThough Countess Mary told Natásha that those words in the Gospel must\nbe understood differently, yet looking at Sónya she agreed with Natásha’s\nexplanation. It really seemed that Sónya did not feel her position trying, and\nhad grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower. She seemed to be\nfond not so much of individuals as of the family as a whole. Like a cat, she"}, {"page": 1605, "text": "had attached herself not to the people but to the home. She waited on the\nold countess, petted and spoiled the children, was always ready to render\nthe small services for which she had a gift, and all this was unconsciously\naccepted from her with insufficient gratitude.\nThe country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt, though not on the same\nscale as under the old prince.\nThe buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were more than\nsimple. The immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood,\nplastered only inside. It had bare deal floors and was furnished with very\nsimple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own serf\ncarpenters out of their own birchwood. The house was spacious and had\nrooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole families of the\nRostóvs’ and Bolkónskis’ relations sometimes came to Bald Hills with\nsixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for months. Besides that,\nfour times a year, on the name days and birthdays of the hosts, as many as a\nhundred visitors would gather there for a day or two. The rest of the year\nlife pursued its unbroken routine with its ordinary occupations, and its\nbreakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers, provided out of the produce of the\nestate."}, {"page": 1606, "text": "CHAPTER IX\nIt was the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of December, 1820. Natásha had\nbeen staying at her brother’s with her husband and children since early\nautumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his own for three\nweeks as he said, but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was\nexpected back every minute.\nBesides the Bezúkhov family, Nicholas’ old friend the retired General\nVasíli Dmítrich Denísov was staying with the Rostóvs this fifth of\nDecember.\nOn the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of\nvisitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for a tail\ncoat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to the new\nchurch he had built, and then receive visitors who would come to\ncongratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about the elections of\nthe nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of that day\nin his usual way. He examined the bailiff’s accounts of the village in\nRyazán which belonged to his wife’s nephew, wrote two business letters,\nand walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and stables before dinner.\nHaving taken precautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on\nthe morrow because it was a great saint’s day, he returned to dinner, and\nwithout having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at the long\ntable laid for twenty persons, at which the whole household had assembled.\nAt that table were his mother, his mother’s old lady companion Belóva, his\nwife, their three children with their governess and tutor, his wife’s nephew\nwith his tutor, Sónya, Denísov, Natásha, her three children, their governess,\nand old Michael Ivánovich, the late prince’s architect, who was living on in\nretirement at Bald Hills.\nCountess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husband took\nhis place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after taking up his\ntable napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing before"}, {"page": 1607, "text": "him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the case when he came in\nto dinner straight from the farm—especially before the soup. Countess\nMary well knew that mood of his, and when she herself was in a good\nframe of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then began to talk\nto him and make him admit that there was no cause for his ill-humor. But\ntoday she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should be angry with her\nwithout any reason, and she felt unhappy. She asked him where he had\nbeen. He replied. She again inquired whether everything was going well on\nthe farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince unpleasantly and he replied\nhastily.\n“Then I’m not mistaken,” thought Countess Mary. “Why is he cross with\nme?” She concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished\nto end the conversation. She knew her remarks sounded unnatural, but\ncould not refrain from asking some more questions.\nThanks to Denísov the conversation at table soon became general and\nlively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left the table and\nwent as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary held out her hand\nand kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry with her.\n“You always have such strange fancies! I didn’t even think of being\nangry,” he replied.\nBut the word always seemed to her to imply: “Yes, I am angry but I\nwon’t tell you why.”\nNicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even Sónya and the\nold countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree, could\nfind nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their moments of\nantagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just after they had been\nhappiest together, they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility,\nwhich occurred most frequently during Countess Mary’s pregnancies, and\nthis was such a time.\n“Well, messieurs et mesdames,” said Nicholas loudly and with apparent\ncheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to vex\nher), “I have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorrow I shall have\nto suffer, so today I’ll go and rest.”\nAnd without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay\ndown on the sofa."}, {"page": 1608, "text": "“That’s always the way,” thought Countess Mary. “He talks to everyone\nexcept me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially when I am in\nthis condition.” She looked down at her expanded figure and in the glass at\nher pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes now looked larger than\never.\nAnd everything annoyed her—Denísov’s shouting and laughter,\nNatásha’s talk, and especially a quick glance Sónya gave her.\nSónya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling\nirritated.\nHaving sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of\nwhat they were saying, she softly left the room and went to the nursery.\nThe children were playing at “going to Moscow” in a carriage made of\nchairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down and played with them\na little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable crossness\nworried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with difficulty, went to the\nsmall sitting room.\n“Perhaps he is not asleep; I’ll have an explanation with him,” she said to\nherself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother, followed her on\ntiptoe. She did not notice him.\n“Mary, dear, I think he is asleep—he was so tired,” said Sónya, meeting\nher in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that she crossed\nher path everywhere). “Andrew may wake him.”\nCountess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that\nSónya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident difficulty\nrefrained from saying something harsh. She made no reply, but to avoid\nobeying Sónya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went to the\ndoor. Sónya went away by another door. From the room in which Nicholas\nwas sleeping came the sound of his even breathing, every slightest tone of\nwhich was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it she saw before her his\nsmooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his whole face, as she had so\noften seen it in the stillness of the night when he slept. Nicholas suddenly\nmoved and cleared his throat. And at that moment little Andrew shouted\nfrom outside the door: “Papa! Mamma’s standing here!” Countess Mary\nturned pale with fright and made signs to the boy. He grew silent, and quiet\nensued for a moment, terrible to Countess Mary. She knew how Nicholas"}, {"page": 1609, "text": "disliked being waked. Then through the door she heard Nicholas clearing\nhis throat again and stirring, and his voice said crossly:\n“I can’t get a moment’s peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring\nhim here?”\n“I only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me....”\nNicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from\nthe door and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little\nblack-eyed three-year-old Natásha, her father’s pet, having learned from her\nbrother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran to her\nfather unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly opened the\ncreaking door, went up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy little\nlegs, and having examined the position of her father, who was asleep with\nhis back to her, rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head.\nNicholas turned with a tender smile on his face.\n“Natásha, Natásha!” came Countess Mary’s frightened whisper from the\ndoor. “Papa wants to sleep.”\n“No, Mamma, he doesn’t want to sleep,” said little Natásha with\nconviction. “He’s laughing.”\nNicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his arms.\n“Come in, Mary,” he said to his wife.\nShe went in and sat down by her husband.\n“I did not notice him following me,” she said timidly. “I just looked in.”\nHolding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glanced at his wife and,\nseeing her guilty expression, put his other arm around her and kissed her\nhair.\n“May I kiss Mamma?” he asked Natásha.\nNatásha smiled bashfully.\n“Again!” she commanded, pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot\nwhere Nicholas had placed the kiss.\n“I don’t know why you think I am cross,” said Nicholas, replying to the\nquestion he knew was in his wife’s mind.\n“You have no idea how unhappy, how lonely, I feel when you are like\nthat. It always seems to me...”"}, {"page": 1610, "text": "“Mary, don’t talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!” he\nsaid gaily.\n“It seems to be that you can’t love me, that I am so plain... always... and\nnow... in this cond...”\n“Oh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, it’s love that\nmakes us see beauty. It is only Malvínas and women of that kind who are\nloved for their beauty. But do I love my wife? I don’t love her, but... I don’t\nknow how to put it. Without you, or when something comes between us like\nthis, I seem lost and can’t do anything. Now do I love my finger? I don’t\nlove it, but just try to cut it off!”\n“I’m not like that myself, but I understand. So you’re not angry with\nme?”\n“Awfully angry!” he said, smiling and getting up. And smoothing his hair\nhe began to pace the room.\n“Do you know, Mary, what I’ve been thinking?” he began, immediately\nthinking aloud in his wife’s presence now that they had made it up.\nHe did not ask if she was ready to listen to him. He did not care. A\nthought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also. And he told her\nof his intention to persuade Pierre to stay with them till spring.\nCountess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, and in\nher turn began thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the children.\n“You can see the woman in her already,” she said in French, pointing to\nlittle Natásha. “You reproach us women with being illogical. Here is our\nlogic. I say: ‘Papa wants to sleep!’ but she says, ‘No, he’s laughing.’ And\nshe was right,” said Countess Mary with a happy smile.\n“Yes, yes.” And Nicholas, taking his little daughter in his strong hand,\nlifted her high, placed her on his shoulder, held her by the legs, and paced\nthe room with her. There was an expression of carefree happiness on the\nfaces of both father and daughter.\n“But you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of this one,” his wife\nwhispered in French.\n“Yes, but what am I to do?... I try not to show...”\nAt that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in\nthe hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived."}, {"page": 1611, "text": "“Somebody has come.”\n“I am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,” said Countess Mary and left the\nroom.\nIn her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a\ngallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the laughing child quickly\nfrom his shoulder and pressed her to his heart. His capers reminded him of\ndancing, and looking at the child’s round happy little face he thought of\nwhat she would be like when he was an old man, taking her into society and\ndancing the mazurka with her as his old father had danced Daniel Cooper\nwith his daughter.\n“It is he, it is he, Nicholas!” said Countess Mary, re-entering the room a\nfew minutes later. “Now our Natásha has come to life. You should have\nseen her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed away so long. Well,\ncome along now, quick, quick! It’s time you two were parted,” she added,\nlooking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.\nNicholas went out holding the child by the hand.\nCountess Mary remained in the sitting room.\n“I should never, never have believed that one could be so happy,” she\nwhispered to herself.

She had grown stouter and broader, so that it was difficult to\nrecognize in this robust, motherly woman the slim, lively Natásha of former\ndays. Her features were more defined and had a calm, soft, and serene\nexpression. In her face there was none of the ever-glowing animation that\nhad formerly burned there and constituted its charm. Now her face and\nbody were often all that one saw, and her soul was not visible at all. All that\nstruck the eye was a strong, handsome, and fertile woman. The old fire very\nrarely kindled in her face now. That happened only when, as was the case\nthat day, her husband returned home, or a sick child was convalescent, or\nwhen she and Countess Mary spoke of Prince Andrew (she never mentioned\nhim to her husband, who she imagined was jealous of Prince Andrew’s\nmemory), or on the rare occasions when something happened to induce her\nto sing, a practice she had quite abandoned since her marriage. At the rare\nmoments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome, fully developed\nbody she was even more attractive than in former days.\nSince their marriage Natásha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in\nPetersburg, on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is to say,\nin Nicholas’ house. The young Countess Bezúkhova was not often seen in\nsociety, and those who met her there were not pleased with her and found\nher neither attractive nor amiable. Not that Natásha liked solitude—she did\nnot know whether she liked it or not, she even thought that she did not—but\nwith her pregnancies, her confinements, the nursing of her children, and\nsharing every moment of her husband’s life, she had demands on her time\nwhich could be satisfied only by renouncing society. All who had known\nNatásha before her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something\nextraordinary. Only the old countess with her maternal instinct had realized\nthat all Natásha’s outbursts had been due to her need of children and a"}, {"page": 1613, "text": "husband—as she herself had once exclaimed at Otrádnoe not so much in\nfun as in earnest—and her mother was now surprised at the surprise\nexpressed by those who had never understood Natásha, and she kept saying\nthat she had always known that Natásha would make an exemplary wife\nand mother.\n“Only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all bounds,”\nsaid the countess, “so that it even becomes absurd.”\nNatásha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk,\nespecially by the French, which says that a girl should not let herself go\nwhen she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments, should be even\nmore careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried, and should\nfascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband.\nNatásha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery, of which\nher singing had been an unusually powerful part. She gave it up just\nbecause it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pains with her manners\nor with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show herself to her\nhusband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avoid inconveniencing him\nby being too exacting. She acted in contradiction to all those rules. She felt\nthat the allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would now be\nmerely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband, to whom she had from the\nfirst moment given herself up entirely—that is, with her whole soul, leaving\nno corner of it hidden from him. She felt that her unity with her husband\nwas not maintained by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her, but\nby something else—indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body\nand soul.\nTo fluff out her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing romantic songs\nto fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn herself\nto attract herself. To adorn herself for others might perhaps have been\nagreeable—she did not know—but she had no time at all for it. The chief\nreason for devoting no time either to singing, to dress, or to choosing her\nwords was that she really had no time to spare for these things.\nWe know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a\nsubject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so trivial that\nit will not grow to infinite proportions if one’s entire attention is devoted to\nit."}, {"page": 1614, "text": "The subject which wholly engrossed Natásha’s attention was her family:\nthat is, her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong entirely\nto her and to the home, and the children whom she had to bear, bring into\nthe world, nurse, and bring up.\nAnd the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her\nwhole soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the larger\ndid that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers\nappear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet was\nunable to accomplish all that she considered necessary.\nThere were then as now conversations and discussions about women’s\nrights, the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights,\nthough these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now; but\nthese topics were not merely uninteresting to Natásha, she positively did not\nunderstand them.\nThese questions, then as now, existed only for those who see nothing in\nmarriage but the pleasure married people get from one another, that is, only\nthe beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance, which lies in the\nfamily.\nDiscussions and questions of that kind, which are like the question of\nhow to get the greatest gratification from one’s dinner, did not then and do\nnot now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the nourishment\nit affords; and the purpose of marriage is the family.\nIf the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who eats two\ndinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his\npurpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.\nIf the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes to have\nmany wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but in that case\nwill not have a family.\nIf the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the\nfamily, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one can\ndigest, and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for the\nfamily—that is, one wife or one husband. Natásha needed a husband. A\nhusband was given her and he gave her a family. And she not only saw no\nneed of any other or better husband, but as all the powers of her soul were\nintent on serving that husband and family, she could not imagine and saw\nno interest in imagining how it would be if things were different."}, {"page": 1615, "text": "Natásha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the\nsociety of her relatives—Countess Mary, and her brother, her mother, and\nSónya. She valued the company of those to whom she could come striding\ndisheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, and with joyful face\nshow a yellow instead of a green stain on baby’s napkin, and from whom\nshe could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better.\nTo such an extent had Natásha let herself go that the way she dressed and\ndid her hair, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousy—she was jealous of\nSónya, of the governess, and of every woman, pretty or plain—were\nhabitual subjects of jest to those about her. The general opinion was that\nPierre was under his wife’s thumb, which was really true. From the very\nfirst days of their married life Natásha had announced her demands. Pierre\nwas greatly surprised by his wife’s view, to him a perfectly novel one, that\nevery moment of his life belonged to her and to the family. His wife’s\ndemands astonished him, but they also flattered him, and he submitted to\nthem.\nPierre’s subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt\nwith, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did not dare\ndine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money on a whim, and did\nnot dare absent himself for any length of time, except on business—in\nwhich his wife included his intellectual pursuits, which she did not in the\nleast understand but to which she attributed great importance. To make up\nfor this, at home Pierre had the right to regulate his life and that of the\nwhole family exactly as he chose. At home Natásha placed herself in the\nposition of a slave to her husband, and the whole household went on tiptoe\nwhen he was occupied—that is, was reading or writing in his study. Pierre\nhad but to show a partiality for anything to get just what he liked done\nalways. He had only to express a wish and Natásha would jump up and run\nto fulfill it.\nThe entire household was governed according to Pierre’s supposed\norders, that is, by his wishes which Natásha tried to guess. Their way of life\nand place of residence, their acquaintances and ties, Natásha’s occupations,\nthe children’s upbringing, were all selected not merely with regard to\nPierre’s expressed wishes, but to what Natásha from the thoughts he\nexpressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be. And she deduced the\nessentials of his wishes quite correctly, and having once arrived at them"}, {"page": 1616, "text": "clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to change his mind\nshe would fight him with his own weapons.\nThus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their\nfirst child who was delicate, when they had to change the wet nurse three\ntimes and Natásha fell ill from despair, Pierre one day told her of\nRousseau’s view, with which he quite agreed, that to have a wet nurse is\nunnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born, despite the\nopposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband himself—\nwho were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself, a thing\nthen unheard of and considered injurious—she insisted on having her own\nway, and after that nursed all her babies herself.\nIt very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife\nwould have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and delight\nwould find in his wife’s ideas and actions the very thought against which\nshe had argued, but divested of everything superfluous that in the\nexcitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his opinion.\nAfter seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm\nconsciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he saw\nhimself reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad within himself\ninextricably mingled and overlapping. But only what was really good in\nhim was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was rejected. And\nthis was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and mysterious\nreflection."}, {"page": 1617, "text": "CHAPTER XI\nTwo months previously when Pierre was already staying with the\nRostóvs he had received a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to come\nto Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being\ndiscussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal\nfounders.\nOn reading that letter (she always read her husband’s letters) Natásha\nherself suggested that he should go to Petersburg, though she would feel his\nabsence very acutely. She attributed immense importance to all her\nhusband’s intellectual and abstract interests though she did not understand\nthem, and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters. To\nPierre’s timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she replied by asking\nhim to go, but to fix a definite date for his return. He was given four weeks’\nleave of absence.\nEver since that leave of absence had expired, more than a fortnight\nbefore, Natásha had been in a constant state of alarm, depression, and\nirritability.\nDenísov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with the\npresent state of affairs, had arrived during that fortnight. He looked at\nNatásha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a person once dear.\nA dull, dejected look, random replies, and talk about the nursery was all he\nsaw and heard from his former enchantress.\nNatásha was sad and irritable all that time, especially when her mother,\nher brother, Sónya, or Countess Mary in their efforts to console her tried to\nexcuse Pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning.\n“It’s all nonsense, all rubbish—those discussions which lead to nothing\nand all those idiotic societies!” Natásha declared of the very affairs in the\nimmense importance of which she firmly believed."}, {"page": 1618, "text": "And she would go to the nursery to nurse Pétya, her only boy. No one\nelse could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this little\nthree-month-old creature when he lay at her breast and she was conscious\nof the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little nose. That creature\nsaid: “You are angry, you are jealous, you would like to pay him out, you\nare afraid—but here am I! And I am he...” and that was unanswerable. It\nwas more than true.\nDuring that fortnight of anxiety Natásha resorted to the baby for comfort\nso often, and fussed over him so much, that she overfed him and he fell ill.\nShe was terrified by his illness, and yet that was just what she needed.\nWhile attending to him she bore the anxiety about her husband more easily.\nShe was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierre’s sleigh was heard at\nthe front door, and the old nurse—knowing how to please her mistress—\nentered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming face.\n“Has he come?” Natásha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move lest\nshe should rouse the dozing baby.\n“He’s come, ma’am,” whispered the nurse.\nThe blood rushed to Natásha’s face and her feet involuntarily moved, but\nshe could not jump up and run out. The baby again opened his eyes and\nlooked at her. “You’re here?” he seemed to be saying, and again lazily\nsmacked his lips.\nCautiously withdrawing her breast, Natásha rocked him a little, handed\nhim to the nurse, and went with rapid steps toward the door. But at the door\nshe stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in her joy left\nthe child too soon, and she glanced round. The nurse with raised elbows\nwas lifting the infant over the rail of his cot.\n“Go, ma’am! Don’t worry, go!” she whispered, smiling, with the kind of\nfamiliarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress.\nNatásha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom.\nDenísov, who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his\npipe, now for the first time recognized the old Natásha. A flood of brilliant,\njoyful light poured from her transfigured face.\n“He’s come!” she exclaimed as she ran past, and Denísov felt that he too\nwas delighted that Pierre, whom he did not much care for, had returned."}, {"page": 1619, "text": "On reaching the vestibule Natásha saw a tall figure in a fur coat\nunwinding his scarf. “It’s he!

You are pleased, you’ve had a good\ntime.... But what about me? You might at least have shown consideration\nfor the children. I am nursing and my milk was spoiled.... Pétya was at\ndeath’s door. But you were enjoying yourself.

I wonder you’re not ashamed! If only you\ncould see what I was like without you, how I suffered!”\n“You are well?”\n“Come, come!” she said, not letting go of his arm.

Every\nevent, joyful or sad, that took place in that house was important to all these\nworlds, but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve over that\noccurrence independently of the others.\nFor instance, Pierre’s return was a joyful and important event and they all\nfelt it to be so.\nThe servants—the most reliable judges of their masters because they\njudge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their acts\nand way of life—were glad of Pierre’s return because they knew that when\nhe was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day to attend to the\nestate, and would be in better spirits and temper, and also because they\nwould all receive handsome presents for the holidays.\nThe children and their governesses were glad of Pierre’s return because\nno one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did.

In Pierre’s presence his face always shone with pleasure and he\nflushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to him. He did not miss a\nsingle word he uttered, and would afterwards, with Dessalles or by himself,\nrecall and reconsider the meaning of everything Pierre had said. Pierre’s\npast life and his unhappiness prior to 1812 (of which young Nicholas had\nformed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard), his\nadventures in Moscow, his captivity, Platón Karatáev (of whom he had\nheard from Pierre), his love for Natásha (of whom the lad was also\nparticularly fond), and especially Pierre’s friendship with the father whom\nNicholas could not remember—all this made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a\nsaint.\nFrom broken remarks about Natásha and his father, from the emotion\nwith which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent\ntenderness with which Natásha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just\nbeginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had loved\nNatásha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father whom the\nboy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be\npictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears\nof sadness and rapture. So the boy also was happy that Pierre had arrived.\nThe guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and\nunite any company he was in.\nThe grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were\npleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly\nand peacefully.\nThe old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them, and\nespecially that Natásha would now be herself again.\nPierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made haste\nto satisfy all their expectations.\nThough the most absent-minded and forgetful of men, Pierre, with the aid\nof a list his wife drew up, had now bought everything, not forgetting his\nmother—and brother-in-law’s commissions, nor the dress material for a\npresent to Belóva, nor toys for his wife’s nephews. In the early days of his\nmarriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect him not\nto forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy, and he had been\ntaken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he forgot\neverything. But in time he grew used to this demand. Knowing that Natásha"}, {"page": 1623, "text": "asked nothing for herself, and gave him commissions for others only when\nhe himself had offered to undertake them, he now found an unexpected and\nchildlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the house,\nand never forgot anything. If he now incurred Natásha’s censure it was only\nfor buying too many and too expensive things. To her other defects (as most\npeople thought them, but which to Pierre were qualities) of untidiness and\nneglect of herself, she now added stinginess.\nFrom the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing\nentailing heavy expenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that he spent\nonly half as much as before, and that his affairs—which had been in\ndisorder of late, chiefly because of his first wife’s debts—had begun to\nimprove.\nLife was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive\nluxury, the kind of life that can be changed at any moment, was no longer\nhis nor did he wish for it. He felt that his way of life had now been settled\nonce for all till death and that to change it was not in his power, and so that\nway of life proved economical.\nWith a merry, smiling face Pierre was sorting his purchases.\n“What do you think of this?” said he, unrolling a piece of stuff like a\nshopman.\nNatásha, who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her\nlap, turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he\nshowed her.\n“That’s for Belóva? Excellent!” She felt the quality of the material. “It\nwas a ruble an arshin, I suppose?”\nPierre told her the price.\n“Too dear!” Natásha remarked. “How pleased the children will be and\nMamma too! Only you need not have bought me this,” she added, unable to\nsuppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls, of\na kind then just coming into fashion.\n“Adèle tempted me: she kept on telling me to buy it,” returned Pierre.\n“When am I to wear it?” and Natásha stuck it in her coil of hair. “When I\ntake little Másha into society? Perhaps they will be fashionable again by\nthen. Well, let’s go now.”"}, {"page": 1624, "text": "And collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to the\nold countess’ rooms.\nThe countess was sitting with her companion Belóva, playing grand-\npatience as usual, when Pierre and Natásha came into the drawing room\nwith parcels under their arms.\nThe countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with a\nfrill that surrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her upper lip had sunk\nin, and her eyes were dim.\nAfter the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession, she felt\nherself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left without aim or\nobject for her existence. She ate, drank, slept, or kept awake, but did not\nlive. Life gave her no new impressions. She wanted nothing from life but\ntranquillity, and that tranquillity only death could give her. But until death\ncame she had to go on living, that is, to use her vital forces. A peculiarity\none sees in very young children and very old people was particularly\nevident in her. Her life had no external aims—only a need to exercise her\nvarious functions and inclinations was apparent. She had to eat, sleep, think,\nspeak, weep, work, give vent to her anger, and so on, merely because she\nhad a stomach, a brain, muscles, nerves, and a liver. She did these things not\nunder any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do, when\nbehind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their functions\nremains unnoticed. She talked only because she physically needed to\nexercise her tongue and lungs. She cried as a child does, because her nose\nhad to be cleared, and so on. What for people in their full vigor is an aim\nwas for her evidently merely a pretext.\nThus in the morning—especially if she had eaten anything rich the day\nbefore—she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest\npretext Belóva’s deafness.\nShe would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end\nof the room.\n“It seems a little warmer today, my dear,” she would murmur.\nAnd when Belóva replied: “Oh yes, they’ve come,” she would mutter\nangrily: “O Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!”\nAnother pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or too\ndamp or not rubbed fine enough. After these fits of irritability her face"}, {"page": 1625, "text": "would grow yellow, and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when\nBelóva would again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the countess’ face yellow.\nJust as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise\nher still-existing faculty of thinking—and the pretext for that was a game of\npatience. When she needed to cry, the deceased count would be the pretext.\nWhen she wanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his health would be the\npretext, and when she felt a need to speak spitefully, the pretext would be\nCountess Mary. When her vocal organs needed exercise, which was usually\ntoward seven o’clock when she had had an after-dinner rest in a darkened\nroom, the pretext would be the retelling of the same stories over and over\nagain to the same audience.\nThe old lady’s condition was understood by the whole household though\nno one ever spoke of it, and they all made every possible effort to satisfy\nher needs. Only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between\nNicholas, Pierre, Natásha, and Countess Mary was the common\nunderstanding of her condition expressed.\nBut those glances expressed something more: they said that she had\nplayed her part in life, that what they now saw was not her whole self, that\nwe must all become like her, and that they were glad to yield to her, to\nrestrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as full of life as\nthemselves, but now so much to be pitied. “Memento mori,” said these\nglances.\nOnly the really heartless, the stupid ones of that household, and the little\nchildren failed to understand this and avoided her."}, {"page": 1626, "text": "CHAPTER XIII\nWhen Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in\none of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of\nplaying patience, and so—though by force of habit she greeted him with the\nwords she always used when Pierre or her son returned after an absence:\n“High time, my dear, high time! We were all weary of waiting for you.\nWell, thank God!” and received her presents with another customary\nremark: “It’s not the gift that’s precious, my dear, but that you give it to me,\nan old woman...”—yet it was evident that she was not pleased by Pierre’s\narrival at that moment when it diverted her attention from the unfinished\ngame.\nShe finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents.\nThey consisted of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a bright-blue\nSèvres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid, and a gold\nsnuffbox with the count’s portrait on the lid which Pierre had had done by a\nminiaturist in Petersburg. The countess had long wished for such a box, but\nas she did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the portrait\nand gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards.\n“Thank you, my dear, you have cheered me up,” said she as she always\ndid. “But best of all you have brought yourself back—for I never saw\nanything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding!

Doesn’t see\nanything, doesn’t remember anything,” she went on, repeating her usual\nphrases. “Look, Anna Timoféevna,” she added to her companion, “see what\na box for cards my son has brought us!”\nBelóva admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material.\nThough Pierre, Natásha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and Denísov had\nmuch to talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess—not\nthat anything was hidden from her, but because she had dropped so far"}, {"page": 1627, "text": "behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her presence\nthey would have had to answer inopportune questions and to repeat what\nthey had already told her many times: that so-and-so was dead and so-and-\nso was married, which she would again be unable to remember—yet they\nsat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from habit, and Pierre\nanswered the countess’ questions as to whether Prince Vasíli had aged and\nwhether Countess Mary Alexéevna had sent greetings and still thought of\nthem, and other matters that interested no one and to which she herself was\nindifferent.\nConversation of this kind, interesting to no one yet unavoidable,\ncontinued all through teatime. All the grown-up members of the family\nwere assembled near the round tea table at which Sónya presided beside the\nsamovar. The children with their tutors and governesses had had tea and\ntheir voices were audible from the next room. At tea all sat in their\naccustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small table where his tea\nwas handed to him; Mílka, the old gray borzoi bitch (daughter of the first\nMílka), with a quite gray face and large black eyes that seemed more\nprominent than ever, lay on the armchair beside him; Denísov, whose curly\nhair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half gray, sat beside countess Mary\nwith his general’s tunic unbuttoned; Pierre sat between his wife and the old\ncountess. He spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she\ncould understand. He told her of external social events and of the people\nwho had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real,\nliving, and distinct group, but who were now for the most part scattered\nabout the world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests\nthey had sown in earlier years. But to the old countess those contemporaries\nof hers seemed to be the only serious and real society. Natásha saw by\nPierre’s animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had much\nto tell them but dare not say it before the old countess. Denísov, not being a\nmember of the family, did not understand Pierre’s caution and being, as a\nmalcontent, much interested in what was occurring in Petersburg, kept\nurging Pierre to tell them about what had happened in the Semënovsk\nregiment, then about Arakchéev, and then about the Bible Society. Once or\ntwice Pierre was carried away and began to speak of these things, but\nNicholas and Natásha always brought him back to the health of Prince Iván\nand Countess Mary Alexéevna."}, {"page": 1628, "text": "“Well, and all this idiocy—Gossner and Tatáwinova?” Denísov asked. “Is\nthat weally still going on?”\n“Going on?” Pierre exclaimed. “Why more than ever! The Bible Society\nis the whole government now!”\n“What is that, mon cher ami?” asked the countess, who had finished her\ntea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal. “What are\nyou saying about the government? I don’t understand.”\n“Well, you know, Maman,” Nicholas interposed, knowing how to\ntranslate things into his mother’s language, “Prince Alexander Golítsyn has\nfounded a society and in consequence has great influence, they say.”\n“Arakchéev and Golítsyn,” incautiously remarked Pierre, “are now the\nwhole government! And what a government! They see treason everywhere\nand are afraid of everything.”\n“Well, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a most estimable\nman. I used to meet him at Mary Antónovna’s,” said the countess in an\noffended tone; and still more offended that they all remained silent, she\nwent on: “Nowadays everyone finds fault. A Gospel Society! Well, and\nwhat harm is there in that?” and she rose (everybody else got up too) and\nwith a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting room.\nThe melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the\nchildren’s voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently some jolly\nexcitement was going on there.\n“Finished, finished!” little Natásha’s gleeful yell rose above them all.\nPierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (Natásha he\nnever lost sight of) and smiled happily.\n“That’s delightful music!” said he.\n“It means that Anna Makárovna has finished her stocking,” said Countess\nMary.\n“Oh, I’ll go and see,” said Pierre, jumping up. “You know,” he added,\nstopping at the door, “why I’m especially fond of that music? It is always\nthe first thing that tells me all is well. When I was driving here today, the\nnearer I got to the house the more anxious I grew. As I entered the anteroom\nI heard Andrúsha’s peals of laughter and that meant that all was well.”"}, {"page": 1629, "text": "“I know! I know that feeling,” said Nicholas. “But I mustn’t go there—\nthose stockings are to be a surprise for me.”\nPierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter grew still\nlouder.\n“Come, Anna Makárovna,” Pierre’s voice was heard saying, “come here\ninto the middle of the room and at the word of command, ‘One, two,’ and\nwhen I say ‘three’... You stand here, and you in my arms—well now! One,\ntwo!...” said Pierre, and a silence followed: “three!” and a rapturously\nbreathless cry of children’s voices filled the room. “Two, two!” they\nshouted.\nThis meant two stockings, which by a secret process known only to\nherself Anna Makárovna used to knit at the same time on the same needles,\nand which, when they were ready, she always triumphantly drew, one out of\nthe other, in the children’s presence."}, {"page": 1630, "text": "CHAPTER XIV\nSoon after this the children came in to say good night. They kissed\neveryone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and they went out.\nOnly young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles whispered to the\nboy to come downstairs.\n“No, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay,” replied\nNicholas Bolkónski also in a whisper.\n“Ma tante, please let me stay,” said he, going up to his aunt.\nHis face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess Mary\nglanced at him and turned to Pierre.\n“When you are here he can’t tear himself away,” she said.\n“I will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles. Good night!” said\nPierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned to young Nicholas\nwith a smile. “You and I haven’t seen anything of one another yet.... How\nlike he is growing, Mary!” he added, addressing Countess Mary.\n“Like my father?” asked the boy, flushing crimson and looking up at\nPierre with bright, ecstatic eyes.\nPierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the\nchildren had interrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork;\nNatásha did not take her eyes off her husband. Nicholas and Denísov rose,\nasked for their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from Sónya—who sat\nweary but resolute at the samovar—and questioned Pierre. The curly-\nheaded, delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner, starting\nevery now and then and muttering something to himself, and evidently\nexperiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head, with\nhis thin neck exposed by his turn-down collar, toward the place where\nPierre sat.\nThe conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in\npower, in which most people see the chief interest of home politics."}, {"page": 1631, "text": "Denísov, dissatisfied with the government on account of his own\ndisappointments in the service, heard with pleasure of the things done in\nPetersburg which seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and sharp\ncomments on what Pierre told them.\n“One used to have to be a German—now one must dance with\nTatáwinova and Madame Kwüdener, and wead Ecka’tshausen and the\nbwethwen. Oh, they should let that fine fellow Bonaparte loose—he’d\nknock all this nonsense out of them! Fancy giving the command of the\nSemënov wegiment to a fellow like that Schwa’tz!” he cried.\nNicholas, though free from Denísov’s readiness to find fault with\neverything, also thought that discussion of the government was a very\nserious and weighty matter, and the fact that A had been appointed Minister\nof This and B Governor General of That, and that the Emperor had said so-\nand-so and this minister so-and-so, seemed to him very important. And so\nhe thought it necessary to take an interest in these things and to question\nPierre. The questions put by these two kept the conversation from changing\nits ordinary character of gossip about the higher government circles.\nBut Natásha, knowing all her husband’s ways and ideas, saw that he had\nlong been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to another\nchannel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of which he had\ngone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend Prince Theodore, and she\nhelped him by asking how his affairs with Prince Theodore had gone.\n“What was it about?” asked Nicholas.\n“Always the same thing,” said Pierre, looking round at his listeners.\n“Everybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be allowed\nto go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to counteract it as far as\nthey can.”\n“What can decent men do?” Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly. “What\ncan be done?”\n“Why, this...”\n“Come into my study,” said Nicholas.\nNatásha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby, now\nheard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary\nfollowed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas Bolkónski"}, {"page": 1632, "text": "followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table in a\nshady corner by the window.\n“Well, what would you do?” asked Denísov.\n“Always some fantastic schemes,” said Nicholas.\n“Why this,” began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room,\nsometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: “the position in\nPetersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything. He has\nabandoned himself altogether to this mysticism” (Pierre could not tolerate\nmysticism in anyone now). “He seeks only for peace, and only these people\nsans foi ni loi * can give it him—people who recklessly hack at and strangle\neverything—Magnítski, Arakchéev, and tutti quanti.... You will agree that if\nyou did not look after your estates yourself but only wanted a quiet life, the\nharsher your steward was the more readily your object might be attained,”\nhe said to Nicholas.\n* Without faith or law.\n“Well, what does that lead up to?” said Nicholas.\n“Well, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law courts, in the army\nnothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; the people are\ntortured, enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young and honest is\ncrushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on. Everything is strained to\nsuch a degree that it will certainly break,” said Pierre (as those who\nexamine the actions of any government have always said since governments\nbegan). “I told them just one thing in Petersburg.”\n“Told whom?”\n“Well, you know whom,” said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under\nhis brows. “Prince Theodore and all those. To encourage culture and\nphilanthropy is all very well of course. The aim is excellent but in the\npresent circumstances something else is needed.”\nAt that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. His face\ndarkened and he went up to the boy.\n“Why are you here?”\n“Why? Let him be,” said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the arm and\ncontinuing. “That is not enough, I told them. Something else is needed.\nWhen you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment,"}, {"page": 1633, "text": "when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as many as possible\nmust join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general calamity.\nEverything that is young and strong is being enticed away and depraved.\nOne is lured by women, another by honors, a third by ambition or money,\nand they go over to that camp. No independent men, such as you or I, are\nleft. What I say is widen the scope of our society, let the mot d’ordre be not\nvirtue alone but independence and action as well!”\nNicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an armchair, sat\ndown in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and frowning\nmore and more.\n“But action with what aim?” he cried. “And what position will you adopt\ntoward the government?”\n“Why, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret if the\ngovernment allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to government, but it is a\nsociety of true conservatives—a society of gentlemen in the full meaning of\nthat word. It is only to prevent some Pugachëv or other from killing my\nchildren and yours, and Arakchéev from sending me off to some Military\nSettlement. We join hands only for the public welfare and the general\nsafety.”\n“Yes, but it’s a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one\nwhich can only cause harm.”\n“Why? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe” (they did not then\nventure to suggest that Russia had saved Europe) “do any harm? The\nTugendbund is an alliance of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it is what\nChrist preached on the Cross.”\nNatásha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at her\nhusband. It was not what he was saying that pleased her—that did not even\ninterest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple and that she\nhad known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she knew that it\nsprang from Pierre’s whole soul), but it was his animated and enthusiastic\nappearance that made her glad.\nThe boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down collar—\nwhom everyone had forgotten—gazed at Pierre with even greater and more\nrapturous joy. Every word of Pierre’s burned into his heart, and with a\nnervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax\nand quill pens his hands came upon on his uncle’s table."}, {"page": 1634, "text": "“It is not at all what you suppose; but that is what the German\nTugendbund was, and what I am proposing.”\n“No, my fwiend!

If we’re not satisfied, let\nus have a bunt of our own. That’s all wight. Je suis vot’e homme!” *\n* “I’m your man.”\nPierre smiled, Natásha began to laugh, but Nicholas knitted his brows\nstill more and began proving to Pierre that there was no prospect of any\ngreat change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his\nimagination. Pierre maintained the contrary, and as his mental faculties\nwere greater and more resourceful, Nicholas felt himself cornered. This\nmade him still angrier, for he was fully convinced, not by reasoning but by\nsomething within him stronger than reason, of the justice of his opinion.\n“I will tell you this,” he said, rising and trying with nervously twitching\nfingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally abandoning the attempt.\n“I can’t prove it to you. You say that everything here is rotten and that an\noverthrow is coming: I don’t see it. But you also say that our oath of\nallegiance is a conditional matter, and to that I reply: ‘You are my best\nfriend, as you know, but if you formed a secret society and began working\nagainst the government—be it what it may—I know it is my duty to obey\nthe government. And if Arakchéev ordered me to lead a squadron against\nyou and cut you down, I should not hesitate an instant, but should do it.’\nAnd you may argue about that as you like!”\nAn awkward silence followed these words. Natásha was the first to\nspeak, defending her husband and attacking her brother. Her defense was\nweak and inapt but she attained her object. The conversation was resumed,\nand no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of Nicholas’ last remark.\nWhen they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas Bolkónski went\nup to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.\n“Uncle Pierre, you... no...

She was afraid that what she was writing would\nnot be understood or approved by her husband.\nShe had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him, but at the\nsame time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have\nto tell him.\n“A diary, Nicholas,” she replied, handing him a blue exercise book filled\nwith her firm, bold writing.\n“A diary?” Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony, and he took up the\nbook.\nIt was in French.\nDecember 4.

In the diary was set down\neverything in the children’s lives that seemed noteworthy to their mother as\nshowing their characters or suggesting general reflections on educational\nmethods. They were for the most part quite insignificant trifles, but did not\nseem so to the mother or to the father either, now that he read this diary\nabout his children for the first time.\nUnder the date “5” was entered:\nMítya was naughty at table.

The radiant eyes\ngazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her diary?\nThere could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his admiration\nfor his wife.\nPerhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, or even\ndone at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort of which the sole aim\nwas the children’s moral welfare delighted him. Had Nicholas been able to\nanalyze his feelings he would have found that his steady, tender, and proud\nlove of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at her spirituality and at the\nlofty moral world, almost beyond his reach, in which she had her being.\nHe was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own\ninsignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the more\nthat she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of himself.\n“I quite, quite approve, my dearest!” said he with a significant look, and\nafter a short pause he added: “And I behaved badly today.

I am sorry you weren’t there. They all fell on me—\nDenísov and Natásha... Natásha is absurd. How she rules over him! And yet\nthere need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own but only\nrepeats his sayings...” added Nicholas, yielding to that irresistible\ninclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and dearest to us. He\nforgot that what he was saying about Natásha could have been applied word\nfor word to himself in relation to his wife.\n“Yes, I have noticed that,” said Countess Mary.\n“When I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, he\nstarted proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not there—what\nwould you have said?”\n“As I see it you were quite right, and I told Natásha so.

Of course he is right there,” said Countess Mary, “but\nhe forgets that we have other duties nearer to us, duties indicated to us by\nGod Himself, and that though we might expose ourselves to risks we must\nnot risk our children.”\n“Yes, that’s it! That’s just what I said to him,” put in Nicholas, who\nfancied he really had said it. “But they insisted on their own view: love of\none’s neighbor and Christianity—and all this in the presence of young\nNicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all my things.”\n“Ah, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about little Nicholas,”\nsaid Countess Mary. “He is such an exceptional boy. I am afraid I neglect\nhim in favor of my own: we all have children and relations while he has no\none.

A wonderful boy, but I am dreadfully\nafraid for him. It would be good for him to have companions.”\n“Well it won’t be for long. Next summer I’ll take him to Petersburg,” said\nNicholas. “Yes, Pierre always was a dreamer and always will be,” he\ncontinued, returning to the talk in the study which had evidently disturbed\nhim. “Well, what business is it of mine what goes on there—whether\nArakchéev is bad, and all that? What business was it of mine when I\nmarried and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with prison, and had\na mother who could not see or understand it?

But she knew\nshe must not say this and that it would be useless to do so. She only took his\nhand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of approval and a confirmation of\nhis thoughts, and after a few minutes’ reflection continued to think aloud.\n“You know, Mary, today Elias Mitrofánych” (this was his overseer)\n“came back from the Tambóv estate and told me they are already offering\neighty thousand rubles for the forest.”\nAnd with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility of\nrepurchasing Otrádnoe before long, and added: “Another ten years of life\nand I shall leave the children... in an excellent position.”\nCountess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told\nher. She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes\nask her what he had been saying, and be vexed if he noticed that she had\nbeen thinking about something else.

When he began proving\nanything, or talking argumentatively and calmly and she, led on by his\nexample, began to do the same, she knew that they were on the verge of a\nquarrel.\nFrom the moment they were alone and Natásha came up to him with\nwide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her\nbosom, saying: “Now you are all mine, mine! You won’t escape!”—from\nthat moment this conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic and\ncontrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one\nand the same time.

Yesterday, for instance, Mítya was\nnaughty...”\n“How like his father he is,” Pierre interjected.\nNatásha knew why he mentioned Mítya’s likeness to Nicholas: the\nrecollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and he\nwanted to know what Natásha thought of it.\n“Nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not\ngenerally accepted. But I understand that you value what opens up a fresh\nline,” said she, repeating words Pierre had once uttered.\n“No, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are an\namusement—almost a pastime,” said Pierre. “For instance, he is collecting\na library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till he has read what\nhe had already bought—Sismondi and Rousseau and Montesquieu,” he\nadded with a smile. “You know how much I...” he began to soften down\nwhat he had said; but Natásha interrupted him to show that this was\nunnecessary.\n“So you say ideas are an amusement to him....”\n“Yes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time in Petersburg I saw\neveryone as in a dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all else is mere\namusement.”\n“Ah, I’m so sorry I wasn’t there when you met the children,” said\nNatásha. “Which was most delighted? Lisa, I’m sure.”\n“Yes,” Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his mind. “Nicholas\nsays we ought not to think. But I can’t help it.

How did this happen?” She wished to express\nthis doubt to him. “Now who could decide whether he is really cleverer\nthan all the others?” she asked herself, and passed in review all those whom\nPierre most respected. Judging by what he had said there was no one he had\nrespected so highly as Platón Karatáev.\n“Do you know what I am thinking about?” she asked. “About Platón\nKaratáev. Would he have approved of you now, do you think?”\nPierre was not at all surprised at this question. He understood his wife’s\nline of thought.\n“Platón Karatáev?” he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely trying\nto imagine Karatáev’s opinion on the subject. “He would not have\nunderstood... yet perhaps he would.”\n“I love you awfully!” Natásha suddenly said. “Awfully, awfully!”\n“No, he would not have approved,” said Pierre, after reflection. “What he\nwould have approved of is our family life.

Go on, go on.”\n“No, you go on, I was talking nonsense,” said Natásha.\nPierre finished what he had begun. It was the sequel to his complacent\nreflections on his success in Petersburg.

He had\ndreamed that he and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as were depicted in\nhis Plutarch, were leading a huge army. The army was made up of white\nslanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in autumn\nand which Dessalles called les fils de la Vièrge.

I will do better.

To seize and put into\nwords, to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single nation,\nappears impossible.\nThe ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe\nand seize the apparently elusive—the life of a people. They described the\nactivity of individuals who ruled the people, and regarded the activity of\nthose men as representing the activity of the whole nation.\nThe question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and\nby what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the ancients\nmet by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a\nchosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish\nends that were predestined.\nFor the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct\nparticipation of the Deity in human affairs.\nModern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.\nIt would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man’s\nsubjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations\nare led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the\ncauses that produce it. But modern history has not done this. Having in\ntheory rejected the view held by the ancients, it still follows them in\npractice.\nInstead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the\nwill of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with\nextraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very various kinds,\nfrom monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses. Instead of the former\ndivinely appointed aims of the Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations, which\nancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity,\nmodern history has postulated its own aims—the welfare of the French,\nGerman, or English people, or, in its highest abstraction, the welfare and"}, {"page": 1650, "text": "civilization of humanity in general, by which is usually meant that of the\npeoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent.\nModern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without replacing\nthem by a new conception, and the logic of the situation has obliged the\nhistorians, after they had apparently rejected the divine authority of the\nkings and the “fate” of the ancients, to reach the same conclusion by\nanother road, that is, to recognize (1) nations guided by individual men, and\n(2) the existence of a known aim to which these nations and humanity at\nlarge are tending.\nAt the basis of the works of all the modern historians from Gibbon to\nBuckle, despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of\ntheir outlooks, lie those two old, unavoidable assumptions.\nIn the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals who in\nhis opinion have directed humanity (one historian considers only monarchs,\ngenerals, and ministers as being such men, while another includes also\norators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, and poets). Secondly, it is\nassumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led is known to the\nhistorians: to one of them this goal is the greatness of the Roman, Spanish,\nor French realm; to another it is liberty, equality, and a certain kind of\ncivilization of a small corner of the world called Europe.\nIn 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and is expressed by a\nmovement of peoples from west to east. Several times it moves eastward\nand collides with a countermovement from the east westward. In 1812 it\nreaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, with remarkable symmetry, a\ncountermovement occurs from east to west, attracting to it, as the first\nmovement had done, the nations of middle Europe. The counter movement\nreaches the starting point of the first movement in the west—Paris—and\nsubsides.\nDuring that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left\nuntilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, millions of men\nmigrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, and millions of Christian\nmen professing the law of love of their fellows slew one another.\nWhat does all this mean? Why did it happen? What made those people\nburn houses and slay their fellow men? What were the causes of these\nevents? What force made men act so? These are the instinctive, plain, and"}, {"page": 1651, "text": "most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the\nmonuments and tradition of that period.\nFor a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the\nscience of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know\nthemselves.\nIf history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said\nthat God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and\ndirected his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply would\nhave been clear and complete. One might believe or disbelieve in the divine\nsignificance of Napoleon, but for anyone believing in it there would have\nbeen nothing unintelligible in the history of that period, nor would there\nhave been any contradictions.\nBut modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit the\nconception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the Deity in\nhuman affairs, and therefore history ought to give other answers.\nModern history replying to these questions says: you want to know what\nthis movement means, what caused it, and what force produced these\nevents? Then listen:\n“Louis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such and\nsuch mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France badly. His\ndescendants were weak men and they too ruled France badly. And they had\nsuch and such favorites and such and such mistresses. Moreover, certain\nmen wrote some books at that time. At the end of the eighteenth century\nthere were a couple of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about all men\nbeing free and equal. This caused people all over France to begin to slash at\nand drown one another. They killed the king and many other people. At that\ntime there was in France a man of genius—Napoleon. He conquered\neverybody everywhere—that is, he killed many people because he was a\ngreat genius. And for some reason he went to kill Africans, and killed them\nso well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to France he\nordered everybody to obey him, and they all obeyed him. Having become\nan Emperor he again went out to kill people in Italy, Austria, and Prussia.\nAnd there too he killed a great many. In Russia there was an Emperor,\nAlexander, who decided to restore order in Europe and therefore fought\nagainst Napoleon. In 1807 he suddenly made friends with him, but in 1811\nthey again quarreled and again began killing many people. Napoleon led six"}, {"page": 1652, "text": "hundred thousand men into Russia and captured Moscow; then he suddenly\nran away from Moscow, and the Emperor Alexander, helped by the advice\nof Stein and others, united Europe to arm against the disturber of its peace.\nAll Napoleon’s allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces\nadvanced against the fresh forces he raised. The Allies defeated Napoleon,\nentered Paris, forced Napoleon to abdicate, and sent him to the island of\nElba, not depriving him of the title of Emperor and showing him every\nrespect, though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as\nan outlaw and a brigand. Then Louis XVIII, who till then had been the\nlaughingstock both of the French and the Allies, began to reign. And\nNapoleon, shedding tears before his Old Guards, renounced the throne and\nwent into exile. Then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists (especially\nTalleyrand, who managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone\nelse and thereby extended the frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and by\nthese conversations made the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the\ndiplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again\nordering their armies to kill one another, but just then Napoleon arrived in\nFrance with a battalion, and the French, who had been hating him,\nimmediately all submitted to him. But the Allied monarchs were angry at\nthis and went to fight the French once more. And they defeated the genius\nNapoleon and, suddenly recognizing him as a brigand, sent him to the\nisland of St. Helena. And the exile, separated from the beloved France so\ndear to his heart, died a lingering death on that rock and bequeathed his\ngreat deeds to posterity. But in Europe a reaction occurred and the\nsovereigns once again all began to oppress their subjects.”\nIt would be a mistake to think that this is ironic—a caricature of the\nhistorical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild expression of the\ncontradictory replies, not meeting the questions, which all the historians\ngive, from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of separate states to\nthe writers of general histories and the new histories of the culture of that\nperiod.\nThe strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that\nmodern history, like a deaf man, answers questions no one has asked.\nIf the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of\nhumanity and of the peoples, the first question—in the absence of a reply to\nwhich all the rest will be incomprehensible—is: what is the power that"}, {"page": 1653, "text": "moves peoples? To this, modern history laboriously replies either that\nNapoleon was a great genius, or that Louis XIV was very proud, or that\ncertain writers wrote certain books.\nAll that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it is not\nwhat was asked. All that would be interesting if we recognized a divine\npower based on itself and always consistently directing its nations through\nNapoleons, Louis-es, and writers; but we do not acknowledge such a power,\nand therefore before speaking about Napoleons, Louis-es, and authors, we\nought to be shown the connection existing between these men and the\nmovement of the nations.\nIf instead of a divine power some other force has appeared, it should be\nexplained in what this new force consists, for the whole interest of history\nlies precisely in that force.\nHistory seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to\neveryone. But in spite of every desire to regard it as known, anyone reading\nmany historical works cannot help doubting whether this new force, so\nvariously understood by the historians themselves, is really quite well\nknown to everybody."}, {"page": 1654, "text": "CHAPTER II\nWhat force moves the nations?\nBiographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this\nforce as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. In their narration events\noccur solely by the will of a Napoleon, and Alexander, or in general of the\npersons they describe. The answers given by this kind of historian to the\nquestion of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long\nas there is but one historian to each event. As soon as historians of different\nnationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event, the replies\nthey give immediately lose all meaning, for this force is understood by them\nall not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways. One historian\nsays that an event was produced by Napoleon’s power, another that it was\nproduced by Alexander’s, a third that it was due to the power of some other\nperson. Besides this, historians of that kind contradict each other even in\ntheir statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular\nperson was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that Napoleon’s power was\nbased on his virtue and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it was based on\nhis trickery and deception of the people. So the historians of this class, by\nmutually destroying one another’s positions, destroy the understanding of\nthe force which produces events, and furnish no reply to history’s essential\nquestion.\nWriters of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to\nrecognize how erroneous is the specialist historians’ view of the force\nwhich produces events. They do not recognize it as a power inherent in\nheroes and rulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously directed\nforces. In describing a war or the subjugation of a people, a general\nhistorian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one man, but\nin the interaction of many persons connected with the event.\nAccording to this view the power of historical personages, represented as\nthe product of many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be regarded as a"}, {"page": 1655, "text": "force that itself produces events. Yet in most cases universal historians still\nemploy the conception of power as a force that itself produces events, and\ntreat it as their cause. In their exposition, an historic character is first the\nproduct of his time, and his power only the resultant of various forces, and\nthen his power is itself a force producing events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and\nothers, for instance, at one time prove Napoleon to be a product of the\nRevolution, of the ideas of 1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that\nthe campaign of 1812 and other things they do not like were simply the\nproduct of Napoleon’s misdirected will, and that the very ideas of 1789\nwere arrested in their development by Napoleon’s caprice. The ideas of the\nRevolution and the general temper of the age produced Napoleon’s power.\nBut Napoleon’s power suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the\ngeneral temper of the age.\nThis curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does it occur at\nevery step, but the universal historians’ accounts are all made up of a chain\nof such contradictions. This contradiction occurs because after entering the\nfield of analysis the universal historians stop halfway.\nTo find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force, the\nsum of the components must equal the resultant. This condition is never\nobserved by the universal historians, and so to explain the resultant forces\nthey are obliged to admit, in addition to the insufficient components,\nanother unexplained force affecting the resultant action.\nSpecialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration\nof the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will\nof Alexander. But the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this opinion of\nthe specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of 1813 and the\nrestoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside Alexander’s\nwill—such as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame de Staël,\nTalleyrand, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and others. The historian evidently\ndecomposes Alexander’s power into the components: Talleyrand,\nChateaubriand, and the rest—but the sum of the components, that is, the\ninteractions of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Staël, and the others,\nevidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon of millions\nof Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand, Madame de\nStaël, and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their\nmutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions. And"}, {"page": 1656, "text": "therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of\nmillions of people resulted—that is, how component forces equal to one A\ngave a resultant equal to a thousand times A—the historian is again obliged\nto fall back on power—the force he had denied—and to recognize it as the\nresultant of the forces, that is, he has to admit an unexplained force acting\non the resultant. And that is just what the universal historians do, and\nconsequently they not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict\nthemselves.\nPeasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, according to\nwhether they want rain or fine weather: “The wind has blown the clouds\naway,” or, “The wind has brought up the clouds.” And in the same way the\nuniversal historians sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in with their\ntheory, say that power is the result of events, and sometimes, when they\nwant to prove something else, say that power produces events.\nA third class of historians—the so-called historians of culture—following\nthe path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers\nand ladies as forces producing events—again take that force to be\nsomething quite different. They see it in what is called culture—in mental\nactivity.\nThe historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their\nprogenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical events may be\nexplained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and\nsuch ways, why not explain them by the fact that such and such people\nwrote such and such books? Of the immense number of indications\naccompanying every vital phenomenon, these historians select the\nindication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause.\nBut despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in\nintellectual activity, only by a great stretch can one admit that there is any\nconnection between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples, and\nin no case can one admit that intellectual activity controls people’s actions,\nfor that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders of the\nFrench Revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality of man, or the\nvery cruel wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love.\nBut even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with\nwhich these histories are filled—admitting that nations are governed by\nsome undefined force called an idea—history’s essential question still"}, {"page": 1657, "text": "remains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs and to the\ninfluence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal\nhistorians, another, newer force—the idea—is added, the connection of\nwhich with the masses needs explanation.

But why\nintellectual activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause\nor expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand. Only\nthe following considerations can have led the historians to such a\nconclusion: (1) that history is written by learned men, and so it is natural\nand agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the\nbasis of the movement of all humanity, just as a similar belief is natural and\nagreeable to traders, agriculturists, and soldiers (if they do not express it,\nthat is merely because traders and soldiers do not write history), and (2) that\nspiritual activity, enlightenment, civilization, culture, ideas, are all\nindistinct, indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use\nwords having a still less definite meaning, and which can therefore be\nreadily introduced into any theory.\nBut not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind (which\nmay possibly even be of use to someone for something) the histories of\nculture, to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate,\nare significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining\nvarious religious, philosophic, and political doctrines as causes of events, as\nsoon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign\nof 1812 for instance, they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an\nexercise of power—and say plainly that that was the result of Napoleon’s\nwill.

And the only such conception\nknown to historians is that of power.\nThis conception is the one handle by means of which the material of\nhistory, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone who breaks\nthat handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some other method of\ntreating historical material, merely deprives himself of the one possible way\nof dealing with it. The necessity of the conception of power as an\nexplanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the universal\nhistorians and historians of culture themselves, for they professedly reject\nthat conception but inevitably have recourse to it at every step.\nIn dealing with humanity’s inquiry, the science of history up to now is\nlike money in circulation—paper money and coin.

We are so\naccustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question:\nwhy did six hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon uttered\ncertain words, seems to us senseless. He had the power and so what he\nordered was done.\nThis reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given\nhim by God. But as soon as we do not admit that, it becomes essential to\ndetermine what is this power of one man over others.\nIt cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one—\na domination based on the application or threat of physical force, like the\npower of Hercules; nor can it be based on the effect of moral force, as in\ntheir simplicity some historians think who say that the leading figures in\nhistory are heroes, that is, men gifted with a special strength of soul and\nmind called genius. This power cannot be based on the predominance of\nmoral strength, for, not to mention heroes such as Napoleon about whose\nmoral qualities opinions differ widely, history shows us that neither a Louis\nXI nor a Metternich, who ruled over millions of people, had any particular\nmoral qualities, but on the contrary were generally morally weaker than any\nof the millions they ruled over."}, {"page": 1663, "text": "If the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral\nqualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for elsewhere\n—in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power.\nAnd that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence, that\nexchange bank of history which offers to exchange history’s understanding\nof power for true gold.\nPower is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or\ntacit consent, to their chosen rulers.\nIn the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how a\nstate and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be\narranged, it is all very clear; but when applied to history that definition of\npower needs explanation.\nThe science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients\nregarded fire—namely, as something existing absolutely. But for history, the\nstate and power are merely phenomena, just as for modern physics fire is\nnot an element but a phenomenon.\nFrom this fundamental difference between the view held by history and\nthat held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely\nhow in its opinion power should be constituted and what power—existing\nimmutably outside time—is, but to history’s questions about the meaning of\nthe mutations of power in time it can answer nothing.\nIf power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler, was\nPugachëv a representative of the will of the people? If not, then why was\nNapoleon I? Why was Napoleon III a criminal when he was taken prisoner\nat Boulogne, and why, later on, were those criminals whom he arrested?\nDo palace revolutions—in which sometimes only two or three people\ntake part—transfer the will of the people to a new ruler? In international\nrelations, is the will of the people also transferred to their conqueror? Was\nthe will of the Confederation of the Rhine transferred to Napoleon in 1806?\nWas the will of the Russian people transferred to Napoleon in 1809, when\nour army in alliance with the French went to fight the Austrians?\nTo these questions three answers are possible:\nEither to assume (1) that the will of the people is always unconditionally\ntransferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen, and that therefore every\nemergence of a new power, every struggle against the power once"}, {"page": 1664, "text": "appointed, should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real\npower; or (2) that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers\nconditionally, under definite and known conditions, and to show that all\nlimitations, conflicts, and even destructions of power result from a\nnonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was\nentrusted to them; or (3) that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers\nconditionally, but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite, and that\nthe appearance of several authorities, their struggles and their falls, result\nsolely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown\nconditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people\nto others.\nAnd these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the\nrelation of the people to their rulers.\nSome historians—those biographical and specialist historians already\nreferred to—in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the\nmeaning of power, seem to consider that the collective will of the people is\nunconditionally transferred to historical persons, and therefore when\ndescribing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one\nabsolute and real power, and that any other force opposing this is not a\npower but a violation of power—mere violence.\nTheir theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history, has\nthe inconvenience—in application to complex and stormy periods in the life\nof nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle\nwith one another—that a Legitimist historian will prove that the National\nConvention, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere infringers of the true\npower, while a Republican and a Bonapartist will prove: the one that the\nConvention and the other that the Empire was the real power, and that all\nthe others were violations of power. Evidently the explanations furnished by\nthese historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young\nchildren.\nRecognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set of historians\nsay that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to\ntheir rulers, and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on\ncarrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement\nprescribed to them. But what this program consists in these historians do\nnot say, or if they do they continually contradict one another."}, {"page": 1665, "text": "Each historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nation’s\nprogress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth, freedom, or\nenlightenment of citizens of France or some other country. But not to\nmention the historians’ contradictions as to the nature of this program—or\neven admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists—\nthe facts of history almost always contradict that theory. If the conditions\nunder which power is entrusted consist in the wealth, freedom, and\nenlightenment of the people, how is it that Louis XIV and Iván the Terrible\nend their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI and Charles I are executed by\ntheir people? To this question historians reply that Louis XIV’s activity,\ncontrary to the program, reacted on Louis XVI. But why did it not react on\nLouis XIV or on Louis XV—why should it react just on Louis XVI? And\nwhat is the time limit for such reactions? To these questions there are and\ncan be no answers. Equally little does this view explain why for several\ncenturies the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their\nheirs, and then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the\nConvention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII, to\nNapoleon again, to Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican\ngovernment, and to Napoleon III. When explaining these rapid transfers of\nthe people’s will from one individual to another, especially in view of\ninternational relations, conquests, and alliances, the historians are obliged to\nadmit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations of the people’s\nwill but are accidents dependent on cunning, on mistakes, on craft, or on the\nweakness of a diplomatist, a ruler, or a party leader. So that the greater part\nof the events of history—civil wars, revolutions, and conquests—are\npresented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of the\npeople’s will, but as results of the ill-directed will of one or more\nindividuals, that is, once again, as usurpations of power. And so these\nhistorians also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to the\ntheory.\nThese historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that some\nplants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist that all that\ngrows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and that the palm, the\nmushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into full growth and no longer\nresemble two leaves, are deviations from the theory.\nHistorians of the third class assume that the will of the people is\ntransferred to historic personages conditionally, but that the conditions are"}, {"page": 1666, "text": "unknown to us. They say that historical personages have power only\nbecause they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them.\nBut in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic\nleaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have those leaders?\nThe leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the people: the\nactivity of the leaders represents the activity of the people.\nBut in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders\nserves as an expression of the people’s will or only some part of it. If the\nwhole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the people’s will, as\nsome historians suppose, then all the details of the court scandals contained\nin the biographies of a Napoleon or a Catherine serve to express the life of\nthe nation, which is evident nonsense; but if it is only some particular side\nof the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the people’s\nlife, as other so-called “philosophical” historians believe, then to determine\nwhich side of the activity of a leader expresses the nation’s life, we have\nfirst of all to know in what the nation’s life consists.\nMet by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure,\nimpalpable, and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable\noccurrences, and declare this abstraction to be the aim of humanity’s\nmovement. The most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the\nhistorians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment, progress, civilization, and\nculture. Postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of\nhumanity, the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of\nmonuments have remained: kings, ministers, generals, authors, reformers,\npopes, and journalists, to the extent to which in their opinion these persons\nhave promoted or hindered that abstraction. But as it is in no way proved\nthat the aim of humanity does consist in freedom, equality, enlightenment,\nor civilization, and as the connection of the people with the rulers and\nenlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the\ncollective will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have\nnoticed, it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate, burn\nhouses, abandon agriculture, and destroy one another never is expressed in\nthe account of the activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses,\npractice agriculture, or slay their fellow creatures.\nHistory proves this at every turn.

For\nus that movement of the peoples from west to east, without leaders, with a\ncrowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit, remains incomprehensible.\nAnd yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a\nrational and sacred aim for the Crusade—the deliverance of Jerusalem—\nhad been clearly defined by historic leaders. Popes, kings, and knights\nincited the peoples to free the Holy Land; but the people did not go, for the\nunknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer\nexisted. The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers can evidently not\ncover the life of the peoples.

The\ntheory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will\nof a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by\nthe experience of history.\nThe theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to\nhistoric persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence\nand be essential for its purposes, but in its application to history, as soon as\nrevolutions, conquests, or civil wars occur—that is, as soon as history\nbegins—that theory explains nothing.\nThe theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the\npeople’s will cannot be verified, for it never occurred.\nWhatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the\ntheory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the\ncollective will was transferred to him.\nThe replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of\na man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no\nattention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the\nfield, or to the driving of the herdsman, should attribute the direction the\nherd takes to what animal happens to be at its head.\n“The herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and\nthe collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader.” This is\nwhat historians of the first class say—those who assume the unconditional\ntransference of the people’s will.\n“If the animals leading the herd change, this happens because the\ncollective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another,\naccording to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction\nselected by the whole herd.” Such is the reply historians who assume that"}, {"page": 1669, "text": "the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions\nwhich they regard as known.

Power. What is power? Power is the\ncollective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what\ncondition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On condition\nthat that person expresses the will of the whole people. That is, power is\npower: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which we do not\nunderstand.\nIf the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning,\nthen having subjected to criticism the explanation of “power” that juridical\nscience gives us, humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and\nhas no real existence.

Experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always\nrelated to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it.\nThe historians, in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine\nintervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of events in the\nexpression of the will of someone endowed with power, but that supposition\nis not confirmed either by reason or by experience.\nOn the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man’s will—his\nwords—are only part of the general activity expressed in an event, as for\ninstance in a war or a revolution, and so without assuming an\nincomprehensible, supernatural force—a miracle—one cannot admit that\nwords can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men. On\nthe other hand, even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events,\nhistory shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does\nnot in most cases produce any effect, that is to say, their commands are\noften not executed, and sometimes the very opposite of what they order\noccurs.\nWithout admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we\ncannot regard “power” as the cause of events.\nPower, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation that\nexists between the expression of someone’s will and the execution of that\nwill by others.\nTo explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a\nconception of the expression of will, referring it to man and not to the\nDeity.\nIf the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient history tells\nus, the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by\nanything, for the Divinity is not controlled by an event. But speaking of\ncommands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in\nrelation to one another, to explain the connection of commands with events\nwe must restore: (1) the condition of all that takes place: the continuity of\nmovement in time both of the events and of the person who commands, and\n(2) the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and\nthose who execute his command."}, {"page": 1671, "text": "CHAPTER VI\nOnly the expression of the will of the Deity, not dependent on time, can\nrelate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or\ncenturies, and only the Deity, independent of everything, can by His sole\nwill determine the direction of humanity’s movement; but man acts in time\nand himself takes part in what occurs.\nReinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we see that no\ncommand can be executed without some preceding order having been given\nrendering the execution of the last command possible.\nNo command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole series\nof occurrences; but each command follows from another, and never refers\nto a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event.\nWhen, for instance, we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to war,\nwe combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive\ncommands dependent one on another. Napoleon could not have commanded\nan invasion of Russia and never did so. Today he ordered such and such\npapers to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, and to Petersburg; tomorrow such\nand such decrees and orders to the army, the fleet, the commissariat, and so\non and so on—millions of commands, which formed a whole series\ncorresponding to a series of events which brought the French armies into\nRussia.\nIf throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion\nof England and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort,\nand yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design\nbut undertook an expedition into Russia, with which country he considered\nit desirable to be in alliance (a conviction he repeatedly expressed)—this\ncame about because his commands did not correspond to the course of\nevents in the first case, but did so correspond in the latter."}, {"page": 1672, "text": "For an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should\norder what can be executed.

Every\norder executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted. All the\nimpossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted.\nOnly the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series of commands\ncorresponding to a series of events, and are executed.\nOur false conception that an event is caused by a command which\nprecedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of\nthousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that\nevent have been executed, we forget about the others that were not executed\nbecause they could not be. Apart from that, the chief source of our error in\nthis matter is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a whole series of\ninnumerable, diverse, and petty events, such for instance as all those which\nled the French armies to Russia, is generalized into one event in accord with\nthe result produced by that series of events, and corresponding with this\ngeneralization the whole series of commands is also generalized into a\nsingle expression of will.\nWe say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it.

The\nincontestable proof of this deduction is that, however many commands were\nissued, the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it, but\nas soon as an event occurs—be it what it may—then out of all the\ncontinually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found\nwhich by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands\nto the events.\nArriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these\ntwo essential questions of history:\n(1) What is power?\n(2) What force produces the movement of the nations?\n(1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals, in which\nthe more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and justifications of\nthe collective action that is performed, the less is his participation in that\naction.\n(2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by intellectual\nactivity, nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed,\nbut by the activity of all the people who participate in the events, and who\nalways combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in\nthe event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa.\nMorally the wielder of power appears to cause the event; physically it is\nthose who submit to the power. But as the moral activity is inconceivable\nwithout the physical, the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the\nother but in the union of the two."}, {"page": 1678, "text": "Or in other words, the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the\nphenomena we are examining.\nIn the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity—that final limit to\nwhich in every domain of thought man’s reason arrives if it is not playing\nwith the subject.

The same\napplies to historical events.

All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path\nhistorical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of\nthat question.\nIf the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he\npleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents.\nIf in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely, that is,\nas he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that man’s in violation of\nthe laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the\nexistence of any laws for the whole of humanity.\nIf there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will cannot\nexist, for then man’s will is subject to that law.\nIn this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most\nancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient\ntimes has been presented in its whole tremendous significance.\nThe problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from\nwhatever point of view—theological, historical, ethical, or philosophic—we\nfind a general law of necessity to which he (like all that exists) is subject.\nBut regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of, we\nfeel ourselves to be free."}, {"page": 1680, "text": "This consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and\nindependent of reason.

Instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and\ninevitability in themselves, and then ranging the phenomena of life under\nthose definitions, history should deduce a definition of the conception of\nfreedom and inevitability themselves from the immense quantity of\nphenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear dependent on\nthese two elements.\nWhatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we\nmay consider, we always regard it as the result partly of man’s free will and\npartly of the law of inevitability."}, {"page": 1685, "text": "Whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of\nthe barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of someone’s action an\nhour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his walk, we are\nunconscious of any contradiction. The degree of freedom and inevitability\ngoverning the actions of these people is clearly defined for us.\nOur conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to\ndifferences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but every\nhuman action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and\ninevitability. In every action we examine we see a certain measure of\nfreedom and a certain measure of inevitability. And always the more\nfreedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive, and the\nmore inevitability the less freedom.\nThe proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases\naccording to the point of view from which the action is regarded, but their\nrelation is always one of inverse proportion.\nA sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry\nmother exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man\ntrained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a\ndefenseless man—seem less guilty, that is, less free and more subject to the\nlaw of necessity, to one who knows the circumstances in which these people\nwere placed, and more free to one who does not know that the man was\nhimself drowning, that the mother was hungry, that the soldier was in the\nranks, and so on. Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years\nago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less\nguilty and his action more due to the law of inevitability, to someone who\nconsiders his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who\nexamined it the day after it was committed. And in the same way every\naction of an insane, intoxicated, or highly excited man appears less free and\nmore inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him who\ncommitted the action, and seems more free and less inevitable to one who\ndoes not know it. In all these cases the conception of freedom is increased\nor diminished and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly\ndecreased or increased, according to the point of view from which the\naction is regarded. So that the greater the conception of necessity the\nsmaller the conception of freedom and vice versa."}, {"page": 1686, "text": "Religion, the common sense of mankind, the science of jurisprudence,\nand history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and\nfreedom.\nAll cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and\nnecessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations:\n(1) The relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds.\n(2) His relation to time.\n(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.\nThe first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man’s\nrelation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our\nunderstanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to\neverything coexisting with him. This is what makes it evident that a\ndrowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing\non dry ground, and that makes the actions of a man closely connected with\nothers in a thickly populated district, or of one bound by family, official, or\nbusiness duties, seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than\nthose of a man living in solitude and seclusion.\nIf we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything around\nhim, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see his relation to\nanything around him, if we see his connection with anything whatever—\nwith a man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the work on which he is\nengaged, even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things\nabout him—we see that each of these circumstances has an influence on\nhim and controls at least some side of his activity. And the more we\nperceive of these influences the more our conception of his freedom\ndiminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him\nincreases.\nThe second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of the\nman to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the man’s\naction occupies in time. That is the ground which makes the fall of the first\nman, resulting in the production of the human race, appear evidently less\nfree than a man’s entry into marriage today. It is the reason why the life and\nactivity of people who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in\ntime cannot seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary, the\nconsequences of which are still unknown to me."}, {"page": 1687, "text": "The degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this\nrespect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance of the\naction and our judgment of it.\nIf I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same\ncircumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me undoubtedly\nfree. But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then being in different\ncircumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if that act had not been\ncommitted much that resulted from it—good, agreeable, and even essential\n—would not have taken place. If I reflect on an action still more remote, ten\nyears ago or more, then the consequences of my action are still plainer to\nme and I find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action\nnot been performed. The farther I go back in memory, or what is the same\nthing the farther I go forward in my judgment, the more doubtful becomes\nmy belief in the freedom of my action.\nIn history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the\npart played by free will in the general affairs of humanity. A contemporary\nevent seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants,\nbut with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which\nprevent our considering anything else possible. And the farther we go back\nin examining events the less arbitrary do they appear.\nThe Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the\ncrafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars still seem to\nus, though already questionably, to be the outcome of their heroes’ will. But\nin the Crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in\nhistory and without which we cannot imagine the modern history of\nEurope, though to the chroniclers of the Crusades that event appeared as\nmerely due to the will of certain people. In regard to the migration of the\npeoples it does not enter anyone’s head today to suppose that the renovation\nof the European world depended on Attila’s caprice. The farther back in\nhistory the object of our observation lies, the more doubtful does the free\nwill of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law\nof inevitability.\nThe third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless\nchain of causation inevitably demanded by reason, in which each\nphenomenon comprehended, and therefore man’s every action, must have"}, {"page": 1688, "text": "its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of what\nwill follow.\nThe better we are acquainted with the physiological, psychological, and\nhistorical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled, and\nthe more correctly we perceive the physiological, psychological, and\nhistorical causes of the action, and the simpler the action we are observing\nand the less complex the character and mind of the man in question, the\nmore subject to inevitability and the less free do our actions and those of\nothers appear.\nWhen we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether a\ncrime, a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we ascribe a\ngreater amount of freedom to it. In the case of a crime we most urgently\ndemand the punishment for such an act; in the case of a virtuous act we rate\nits merit most highly. In an indifferent case we recognize in it more\nindividuality, originality, and independence. But if even one of the\ninnumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain element\nof necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime, or the\nacknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom of the\napparently original action. That a criminal was reared among malefactors\nmitigates his fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father or mother, or\nself-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward, is more comprehensible than\ngratuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems less deserving of sympathy\nand less the result of free will. The founder of a sect or party, or an inventor,\nimpresses us less when we know how or by what the way was prepared for\nhis activity. If we have a large range of examples, if our observation is\nconstantly directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in people’s\nactions, their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less free the\nmore correctly we connect the effects with the causes. If we examined\nsimple actions and had a vast number of such actions under observation, our\nconception of their inevitability would be still greater. The dishonest\nconduct of the son of a dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman who\nhad fallen into bad company, a drunkard’s relapse into drunkenness, and so\non are actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause.\nIf the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of\nmental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpleton—then,\nknowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and\nintelligence in question, we see so large an element of necessity and so little"}, {"page": 1689, "text": "free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can\nforetell the result.\nOn these three considerations alone is based the conception of\nirresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by\nall legislative codes.

If we examine a man little dependent on external\nconditions, whose action was performed very recently, and the causes of\nwhose action are beyond our ken, we get the conception of a minimum of\ninevitability and a maximum of freedom.\nIn neither case—however we may change our point of view, however\nplain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the\nexternal world, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or short\nthe period of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of\nthe action may be—can we ever conceive either complete freedom or\ncomplete necessity.\n(1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the\ninfluence of the external world, we never get a conception of freedom in\nspace. Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him\nand by his own body. I lift my arm and let it fall. My action seems to me\nfree; but asking myself whether I could raise my arm in every direction, I\nsee that I raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to\nthat action either from things around me or from the construction of my\nown body. I chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there\nwere fewest obstacles. For my action to be free it was necessary that it\nshould encounter no obstacles. To conceive of a man being free we must\nimagine him outside space, which is evidently impossible."}, {"page": 1691, "text": "(2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of\nthe deed, we never get a conception of freedom in time. For if I examine an\naction committed a second ago I must still recognize it as not being free, for\nit is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was committed. Can I lift\nmy arm? I lift it, but ask myself: could I have abstained from lifting my arm\nat the moment that has already passed? To convince myself of this I do not\nlift it the next moment. But I am not now abstaining from doing so at the\nfirst moment when I asked the question. Time has gone by which I could\nnot detain, the arm I then lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now\nrefrain from lifting, nor is the air in which I lifted it the same that now\nsurrounds me. The moment in which the first movement was made is\nirrevocable, and at that moment I could make only one movement, and\nwhatever movement I made would be the only one. That I did not lift my\narm a moment later does not prove that I could have abstained from lifting\nit then. And since I could make only one movement at that single moment\nof time, it could not have been any other. To imagine it as free, it is\nnecessary to imagine it in the present, on the boundary between the past and\nthe future—that is, outside time, which is impossible.\n(3) However much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be\nincreased, we never reach a conception of complete freedom, that is, an\nabsence of cause. However inaccessible to us may be the cause of the\nexpression of will in any action, our own or another’s, the first demand of\nreason is the assumption of and search for a cause, for without a cause no\nphenomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to perform an action\nindependently of any cause, but my wish to perform an action without a\ncause is the cause of my action.\nBut even if—imagining a man quite exempt from all influences,\nexamining only his momentary action in the present, unevoked by any\ncause—we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as\nequaled zero, we should even then not have arrived at the conception of\ncomplete freedom in man, for a being uninfluenced by the external world,\nstanding outside of time and independent of cause, is no longer a man.\nIn the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid\nof freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability.\n(1) However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space\nin which man is situated, that knowledge can never be complete, for the"}, {"page": 1692, "text": "number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space. And\ntherefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined,\nthere is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains.\n(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action we\nare examining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite, while\ntime is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never be absolute\ninevitability.\n(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action, we\nshall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and so again we never\nreach absolute inevitability.\nBut besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to\nequal zero, we assumed in some given case—as for instance in that of a\ndying man, an unborn babe, or an idiot—complete absence of freedom, by\nso doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are\nexamining, for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man. And so\nthe conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of\ninevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the\nconception of a man’s completely free action.\nAnd so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of\ninevitability without any freedom, we must assume the knowledge of an\ninfinite number of space relations, an infinitely long period of time, and an\ninfinite series of causes.\nTo imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of\ninevitability, we must imagine him all alone, beyond space, beyond time,\nand free from dependence on cause.\nIn the first case, if inevitability were possible without freedom we should\nhave reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of inevitability itself,\nthat is, a mere form without content.\nIn the second case, if freedom were possible without inevitability we\nshould have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time, and\ncause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would be\nnothing, or mere content without form.\nWe should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man’s\nwhole outlook on the universe is constructed—the incomprehensible\nessence of life, and the laws defining that essence."}, {"page": 1693, "text": "Reason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it visibility\nis infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise.

Just so the force of man’s free will is distinguished by reason from\nthe other forces of nature only by the definition reason gives it. Freedom,\napart from necessity, that is, apart from the laws of reason that define it,\ndiffers in no way from gravitation, or heat, or the force that makes things\ngrow; for reason, it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life.\nAnd as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies,\nthe undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity, or of chemical\naffinity, or of the vital force, forms the content of astronomy, physics,\nchemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in the same way does the force\nof free will form the content of history. But just as the subject of every\nscience is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that\nessence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics, even the\nmanifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space, in time,\nand in dependence on cause forms the subject of history, while free will\nitself is the subject of metaphysics.\nIn the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of\ninevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force. Vital force is only\nan expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know of\nthe essence of life.\nSo also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability, what\nis unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only an expression for\nthe unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life."}, {"page": 1695, "text": "CHAPTER XI\nHistory examines the manifestations of man’s free will in connection\nwith the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it\ndefines this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a science only\nin so far as this free will is defined by those laws.\nThe recognition of man’s free will as something capable of influencing\nhistorical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for history as the\nrecognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for\nastronomy.\nThat assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws,\nthat is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body moving\nfreely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no conception\nof the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists. If any single\naction is due to free will, then not a single historical law can exist, nor any\nconception of historical events.\nFor history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end of\nwhich is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a\nconsciousness of man’s will in the present moves in space, time, and\ndependence on cause.\nThe more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more\nevident are the laws of that movement. To discover and define those laws is\nthe problem of history.\nFrom the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its\nsubject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events in man’s\nfree will, a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible, for however\nman’s free will may be restricted, as soon as we recognize it as a force not\nsubject to law, the existence of law becomes impossible.\nOnly by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that is, by\nregarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince ourselves of the"}, {"page": 1696, "text": "absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then instead of seeking causes,\nhistory will take the discovery of laws as its problem.\nThe search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of\nthought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with\nthe self-destruction toward which—ever dissecting and dissecting the\ncauses of phenomena—the old method of history is moving.\nAll human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at\ninfinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the\nprocess of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of\nunknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception of cause,\nmathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all unknown,\ninfinitely small, elements.\nIn another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences\nhave proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say\nthat the sun or the earth had a property of attraction; he said that all bodies\nfrom the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting one another,\nthat is, leaving aside the question of the cause of the movement of the\nbodies, he expressed the property common to all bodies from the infinitely\nlarge to the infinitely small. The same is done by the natural sciences:\nleaving aside the question of cause, they seek for laws. History stands on\nthe same path. And if history has for its object the study of the movement of\nthe nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in the lives of\nindividuals, it too, setting aside the conception of cause, should seek the\nlaws common to all the inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of\nfree will."}, {"page": 1697, "text": "CHAPTER XII\nFrom the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved, the\nmere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves\nsufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients. By disproving\nthat law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the\nmovements of the bodies, but without disproving it, it would seem\nimpossible to continue studying the Ptolemaic worlds. But even after the\ndiscovery of the law of Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still studied\nfor a long time.\nFrom the time the first person said and proved that the number of births\nor of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that this or that mode of\ngovernment is determined by certain geographical and economic\nconditions, and that certain relations of population to soil produce\nmigrations of peoples, the foundations on which history had been built were\ndestroyed in their essence.\nBy refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been\nretained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue\nstudying historic events as the results of man’s free will. For if a certain\nmode of government was established or certain migrations of peoples took\nplace in consequence of such and such geographic, ethnographic, or\neconomic conditions, then the free will of those individuals who appear to\nus to have established that mode of government or occasioned the\nmigrations can no longer be regarded as the cause.\nAnd yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the\nlaws of statistics, geography, political economy, comparative philology, and\ngeology, which directly contradict its assumptions.\nThe struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly\nfought out in physical philosophy. Theology stood on guard for the old"}, {"page": 1698, "text": "views and accused the new of violating revelation. But when truth\nconquered, theology established itself just as firmly on the new foundation.\nJust as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between\nthe old and the new conception of history, and theology in the same way\nstands on guard for the old view, and accuses the new view of subverting\nrevelation.\nIn the one case as in the other, on both sides the struggle provokes\npassion and stifles truth. On the one hand there is fear and regret for the loss\nof the whole edifice constructed through the ages, on the other is the\npassion for destruction.\nTo the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy, it\nseemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in God, in the\ncreation of the firmament, and in the miracle of Joshua the son of Nun. To\nthe defenders of the laws of Copernicus and Newton, to Voltaire for\nexample, it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion, and he\nutilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against religion.\nJust so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of inevitability,\nto destroy the conception of the soul, of good and evil, and all the\ninstitutions of state and church that have been built up on those conceptions.\nSo too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of the law of\ninevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion, though the law\nof inevitability in history, like the law of Copernicus in astronomy, far from\ndestroying, even strengthens the foundation on which the institutions of\nstate and church are erected.\nAs in the question of astronomy then, so in the question of history now,\nthe whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or\nnonrecognition of something absolute, serving as the measure of visible\nphenomena. In astronomy it was the immovability of the earth, in history it\nis the independence of personality—free will.\nAs with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth\nlay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth’s fixity and of the\nmotion of the planets, so in history the difficulty of recognizing the\nsubjection of personality to the laws of space, time, and cause lies in\nrenouncing the direct feeling of the independence of one’s own personality.\nBut as in astronomy the new view said: “It is true that we do not feel the\nmovement of the earth, but by admitting its immobility we arrive at"}, {"page": 1699, "text": "absurdity, while by admitting its motion (which we do not feel) we arrive at\nlaws,” so also in history the new view says: “It is true that we are not\nconscious of our dependence, but by admitting our free will we arrive at\nabsurdity, while by admitting our dependence on the external world, on\ntime, and on cause, we arrive at laws.”\nIn the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an\nunreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel; in the\npresent case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that does not\nexist, and to recognize a dependence of which we are not conscious."}, {"page": 1700, "text": "*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WAR AND PEACE\n***\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be\nrenamed.\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law\nmeans that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the\nFoundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States\nwithout permission and without paying copyright royalties.
